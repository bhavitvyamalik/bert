3000	Size up!!! this dress is great quality and so flattering but tight in the arms and chest. ordered in my usual xs and will regretfully need to return it.
3001	The picture doesn't do this blouse any justice. the fabric is really nice and the back is really what makes this blouse. the bows down the back of the blouse make it pop!
3002	Super flattering and lovely material. dress-up or down. they run true to size.
3003	Unfortunately, this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8, 130lbs, and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also, while the dress is lined, both layers are quite thin- not see through, but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material, it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.
3004	Kind of excited about this little number. i found it online and was immediately drawn to the boho-chic look. it arrived and i was impressed with the weight of the dress and the detailing that is missed in the photo.
3005	Such cute tights! i saw them and had to have them. they are a thick knit - very good quality. the color is a dark navy and the little foxes and a nice pop of color. i get lots of compliments on them.
3006	"This top hit at my hips not as it appears on the model in the photo, and i am short at 5' 2"". cute top, but shorter than i had expected and definitely not a tunic style."
3007	Really love this blouse for several reasons....it fits! pretty true to size depending on how fitted you want it. not too much of a difference between a 6 or 8. it is a bit sheer but i am not worried about it. now my favorite part is the tie in the middle.....finally not a boxy waist, it's up to you to pull it in or loosen. the length is perfect...not too long so it works over skirts too. it is soft. my only concern is how long will it last. will require careful washing and ironing. may end up pu
3008	"I tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today. it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress, with very interestingly cut seams. the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract. gorgeous and high quality!  fit: i am 5'6"" and curvy, usually a size 14/16, and the xl fits quite roomy on me (that's the size i ordered because i like flowy things). so it definitely runs large. usually i have better luck with a-line dress shap"
3009	You just can't go wrong with a perfect white top. i'm usually xs or s and got this top in xs & the fit is perfect. the bottom is a very subtle bubble hem that you can't really see in the picture. the top is boxy but not too overwhelming since the proportions are just right. thesis a great transitional top that will go with skinny jeans, pencil skirts or even a pair of utility pants. it can easily be dressed up or down.
3010	I purchased this in both the green color and the grey color and am in love with both. they are much longer than last years design and it has a pretty weave to the sweater with multiple layers that sit perfectly past the hips. the fit is true to size although the fabric is quite thin and i worry about pulls. also, the sleeves are a bit long, but this doesn't bother me too much at this point. very versatile!
3011	I tried a pair of the hyphen chinos on at retailer and loved them. they are comfortable and a great casual look. i bought two more pairs in different colors on line.
3012	"I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however, after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6"", size 4, hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure."
3013	Loved these pants when i tried them on they looked great and felt so comfortable. when i washed according to the directions on the tag the bottom of one leg lost so much color that i can't wear them anymore..so disappointed!
3014	"This is a beautiful dress with unfortunate design flaws at the bodice of the dress. the fit at hips and length is perfect, falling just to my knee (i'm 5'5"" 142 lbs.) and grazing my hips. in that regard the fit is spectacular. but the bodice seems cut very oddly, which would require tayloring to correct. the armholes are large and flared at the bottom which leaves 'wings' just under the arms that stick out. since this dress has a side zip, to correct that would seem a major undertaking. the stra"
3015	I tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 (a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea). the 4 fit in the outer layer, however as the previous poster mentioned, the lining is super tight. i couldn't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips. the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining. not sure what when wrong here but it's a shame because it's a really cute dress.
3016	I liked the details on the front a d back of this top. while i was pregnant i purchased the white color in the small. everything fit, suprisingly, the top even covered up my pregnant belly. i returned it since i didn't want a top with so much room in the waist area post pregnancy. i recently got this top in the xs thinking that it will be a great stylish breasting top. while everything fit in the hips, and waist, the chest area was too tight. this top did not work for me as i am in between sizes
3017	I absolutely adore this shirt, it is such a comfortable material and goes great with a pair of jeans! i love how it fits tightly in the sleeves and flows out at the bottom just the right amount. i highly recommend adding this to your wardrobe.
3018	Super cute jacket .perfect for fall i can't stop wearing it
3019	"At 4""11 i usually have to order items in petite and sometimes still have trouble fitting properly into items but i was able to buy this sweater in an xs! i figured with the high front and low back i wouldn't be able to fit it but it looks great on. not only is the fit amazing, but it feels amazing as well. it's such an easy wear and the high/low look is effortlessly chic!"
3020	"I purchased for my daughter who is mid 30's and she loved the romper. i'm going to list her size since that is appropriate for who is wearing the item."
3021	I loved this dress so much i got it in 2 colors. i had to send it back twice to get the size right. i ended up with a medium. the fabric was pretty wrinkly on arrival. it is dryclean only. overall it is an easy and relaxed dress appropriate for work but still very cute.
3022	"I really love this dress. it's very flattering for all body types - i'm 5'4"", 120 and i purchased a small. it also looks really cute with a stretchy belt. in the picture - it doesn't show this, but it has these cute snap sleeves that adds some great detail. it's also very comfortable. it is a thin material, so for those looking for a thicker fabric - this may not be the right dress. loved it!"
3023	This top is so much better in person. i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy. it is not and i have sensitive skin. i love this top and have got lots of compliments.
3024	This is a lovely dress, but much more casual than i thought from the picture. the material is very thin and casual. i needed a dressier dress, and i didn't need another casual dress, so i sent it back, but it would be fine if you want something casual.
3025	Kicky little pleat in the back is interesting and comfortable. great fit, good colors and doesn't wrinkle easily.
3026	This top is beautiful. everything about it is beautiful. it has lovely detail on the back as well as the front. i chose a size 12 which seems to run true. it fit. however, regretfully i had to return the top. i came back here hoping i could find it in ivory or black... but there's only one color. the dusky rose is lovely, but i'm blonde and true pink is fine; this shade not so good, although as someone else here commented, it is a stunning shade of pink, very unusual -- like old dried roses. i l
3027	"I recommend this topper but with reservations. it is beautiful looking, especially the lace portion.  it is also very wide. the gathered portion is a complete design fail, it balloons up right below the bust, making one look wide and pretty ridiculous. it's obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body. but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise.  i ordered size s, the smallest available, and it fit very wide more like a"
3028	"Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your ""normal"" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love"
3029	"I was so excited to get this top! i love the bow at the neck and the frill sleeves, so current. unfortunately, it was difficult for me to pull it over my head! the neck opening is too small, and there are no buttons. i have a pretty small head and very fine straight hair, so i can imagine that others will have a similar issue getting it on!  i am keeping it because i love the style, but will need to alter the neck myself. the rest of the top fits just a bit loose. i got the x-small and am a 3"
3030	Love this sweater. it fits true to size. fun and different. purchased 30% off but i don't think the price it terrible depending on your clothing budget.
3031	"This pants are very comfortable, and add a little flare to my typical ""mom pajama"" look. i found them true to size; size small fit my 5'7, 135lbs frame. comfortable to sleep and lounge in!"
3032	Great coat. love the length but it definitely runs big. i got a m even though i would normally be a l and it's roomy. fabric has pulles under the arms after 1 wear but overall quality is good. very warm. great look for work w. black pants.
3033	I bought this top to wear this fall, and it does not disappoint. it's a heavier light knit and the pattern is subtle but really pretty. i ordered a size smaller than i usually wear so that i can wear it on or off the shoulder, making this great for work.
3034	"Love the pattern play on this skirt! i had to size up to a 6 (i usually take a 2 or 4 in skirts) as it was too snug in the hips/waist. going up a size worked well and the hem hit me at the knee (i'm 5' 6""). thought it looked cute with the cloth & stone chambray tank :)"
3035	Really cute, really comfy, great color, love the oversize buttons! all around just a great skirt. nice shade that goes right into fall. i have several of this style skirt and love them all!
3036	I love the fabric, texture mix and length of this top. i gave it a four stars because my usual size is a medium but had to go with a large. a medium felt a bit too snug through the shoulders. very happy with this top and look forward to wearing it a lot.
3037	I now have this tee in 3 colors - partly because my daughter loves and shares them with me. i typically get a size medium because i like things to fit a little loose, but needed a small in this shirt. goes great with all styles of jeans/knakis.
3038	All of my friends loved these pants- as did i! these are so gorgeous. the sequins seem well stitched. the small fit me well- hanging straight as pictured, not too snug or uncomfortable. they hit me at the ankle. there are back pockets.
3039	This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'4 and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.
3040	Overall beautiful skirt, material is a little on the heavy and stiff side but still a really nice skirt
3041	"I saw a sales associate (sa) wearing it at my local retailer and totally loved it. this t-shirt runs very large, so it depends on how one wants to wear it. the sa wore it oversized and tied to the side, super cute. i tried on a regular small and it was still 2 sizes too big and too long on me. i ordered the xs petite and it fits perfectly, not too fitted and not too loose (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). my mother was a great embroider and the ""giddy up"" embroidery work at the neckline and the"
3042	"These cords are great--lightweight for fl winters, and the bootcut flare bottom is super cute with ballet flats or booties. i am 5'10"" and typically a size 8; the size 29 fit perfectly. they have a little stretch to them, which is great. very flattering--wish i could order in more colors!!"
3043	I saw this in my local retailer styled with a tank top underneath and i fell in love and bought the combo right away. it is a vest, so it's not meant to be fitted, so i think sizing down is fine. i'm usually an xs/s in tops, i went with the xs in this, and j still get that relaxed look which is nice. this vest is great, very versatile, simple yet adds great style. it was a bit of a splurge for me but i'm happy i added it to my closet!
3044	"I'm so glad the other reviews were so good. i couldn't agree more. this top is very well made, lined. i'm 5'5"", 32 dd and got the 6. i'll have to take up the shoulders a bit since the v falls a little low on me. what can i say, i'm modest. :) i wish they made more colors. this top is awesome."
3045	I look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size. for some reason, this fabric isn't working for me. i think it's the sheed combined with the stretch (or lack there of) of the fabric. i'll have to pass.
3046	This is my 6th pair of rockets. they've become my hands down, favorite cut from citizens. for curvy girls, these are the perfect skinny jeans. they come up high enough to tuck everything in, no muffins top. they shape and lift my butt, which i need because i've got a generous one. they hold their shape amazingly well and don't require a wash with every wear in order to regain their shape. they truly have been the holy grail of jeans, for me. with all that said, these are not a 5 star version of
3047	I was a little surprised when i received this dress, as it is little more than an a-line tube with elastic casing at the top and a cute knotted detail at the bust. i guess i expected the bust to be lined at least. it is unlined, and a relatively thin jersey knit. it wasn't see through, for it is black, but i expected a heavier fabric. i would never have paid full price for this, but at the sale price it is very cute and comfortable. it is also flattering and the fit is true to size. the a-line t
3048	I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.
3049	The length is lovely, the color is nice, the fabric feels like silk but isn't (so you can wash it), and the cut is flattering if you're a b cup or below. for me, the pleats on top made my chestiness look like fattiness.
3050	The perfect dress for dinner date or summer weddings. or traveling. love this dress. not sure on washing yet since it is a silk dress. extremely comfortably and beautiful. i can't recall the last time i bought a new dress.
3051	"The kimono is as pictured. the colors are true to what is shown on line, though the description indicates ""green multi""--it is not green. i returned the item, however. the quality is fine, but it seemed extremely over-priced to me. it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality."
3052	Purchased as a gift for someone who needs to up her pj ante -- soft cute fun
3053	"Great sweater. long and warm, but not too thick. i am 5'4"" and ordered a medium. fits and hangs nicely."
3054	"I got the dress with the boat pattern- such a fun dress and very flattering. it is definitely a coral, but i am able to wear this with my fair skin and will probably look better with some color as spring/summer finally arrive. i am only 5""2' so the length is great for me- i can wear this to work, but it would be pretty short for a tall gal. definitely recommend!"
3055	"These are my favorite pair of capris/ankle jeans ever! i'm 5'4"", 120lbs and got the 28 petite in gray. the fit is fantastic and the length is perfect for summer days (couple inches above my ankles). the gray color is so versatile and i can dress it up or down. i plan on getting it in other colors as well since the fit is so good."
3056	"I am going to review this pretty much the way the person ahead of me reviewed it. first, the colors are way more vibrant in person than in the photo. there is even a lavender (which you can sort of see under the yellow stripe). it really makes it look different. second, it is monstrously huge. i am 5'3"", 110 pounds and i ordered the xs and it completely swallowed me up. because of the vibrancy of the colors, it didn't blend well with my fair complexion and also, it is like a heavy sweater, not a"
3057	While the print is cute, the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra, more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully, if retailer continues to do swimwear, they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)
3058	I know this is supposed to be a loose, flowy fit which is exactly the style i love. however, this is beyond tent-like. i'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small. fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper. huge bummer, especially after seeing a few 5-stars.
3059	The drape of this shirt is flattering, and i appreciate the longer tail in back. the fabric is light, and that is perfect for our fall transition here in so. california. with a sweater, it will be great in winter, too. so far, i've worn it with jeans and booties, and have accessorized it in different ways to dress it up or down.
3060	This dress is beautiful. swingy and fun, and the floral pattern is just stunning for fall and winter. i am planning on wearing it with black tights and ankle booties. could be dressed up or down- very versitle. fits my tall curvy frame perfectly. love.
3061	"Quite possibly, one of the most flattering, beautiful, and effortlessly romantic dresses i have ever tried on. and, to top it off, it has a sweet surprise: the silk slip on the inside of the dress has the same print as the outside shell, and it is so lovely, that if you feel like wearing something short and sweet, you can wear the slip as its own dress.  runs true to size, to maybe just a little bit big--if you have a smaller bustline and narrow hips, you might be able to size down.  it's cr"
3062	"This is much more a blouse than a ""tee"". the detailing is beautiful and the fabric on the back is a more stuff, starched cotton, not stretchy jersey. because of that i felt like this top ran small. i had to size up."
3063	"I like what they were going for here, and the fabric. but it falls short in that i can't wear it to work---the back ""keyhole"" is massive so i can't wear my normal bras, and the very wide neck also shows bra straps, so unless i want to go with a strapless bra, it's not useful for me. i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that. i'd go without, but that is a no-no where i work. i may try getting a size smaller. i wear a med. and i got a small and mayb"
3064	Corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit well....even with stretch added. so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif mid-rise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great! they were long enough as well. i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived, it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones. how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well. these are not old lady pants either...how nice!
3065	"I have been shopping at retailer for years and this is my first review - that is how much i love this dress! it is so incredibly comfortable. it is like wearing a cozy blanket. you guys, it twirls. :) i never received as many compliments on an outfit as i do when i wear this dress. (i bought the orange one). i am plus size and i don't wear a whole lot of knee length dresses. dresses in general are hard to find because they don't fit right so i was thrilled to find this. i am also thrilled that it"
3066	This top is beautiful. so beautiful that i am keeping it even though it is a little bit large and drapey. the fabric has a golden glow to it. the details in the back are darling. perfect for a romantic dinner out.
3067	I'm a huge skort fan from way back, but finding a cute skort is harder than finding a needle in a haystack, so when i saw this on line i was excited, and when i saw it in the store, my hopes were confirmed. this is truly a stylish, functional skort!! the diagnol hem is flattering along with the two buckle details. love the pockets. you even get a little bonus pocket. the fabric is a beautiful color (moss) and soft, so it hangs in a flattering manner, instead of bunching up. this skort looks grea
3068	I really like this top! excellent over a casual dress!! perfect for spring, summer and fall!
3069	I love everything about this tunic : the color, fabric and design! i am very happy with this perches!
3070	I like this dress a lot, the fabric is nice, the necklines are unusual and flattering but there is definitely some added volume at the hips with the pockets. really comfortable dress.
3071	"I saw a photographer wearing this at a wedding i went to in october. i absolutely fell in love. it is beautiful. i can't wait to wear it for the holidays! i got the small petite and i am 5'2"", 125 lbs. fit great. enjoy!"
3072	This top runs large... an entire size. i am on the fence about it.. it is quite *stylish* and well made. it is fairly heavy and seems like it would be very warm. the burgundy color is nice. the issue i am having with it is the way the lower black arms are sewn in the upper arms. it just seems somewhat *odd*. overall though, it is very *forgiving*,especially with the black border around the entire bottom. it is the perfect top to showcase a great long necklace and it would be great with leggings
3073	As other reviewers have pointed out, this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight, and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve, but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.
3074	I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful, both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees, not like shown in the picture here. on that note, i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.
3075	I love this jacket. i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times. the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting. it fits tts. i am typically an xl and i ordered that size- i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me. the pictures on the website don't do it justice. it looks much nicer in person.
3076	So different than anything in my closet. it's wide with a beautiful drape. fabric is soft but substantial. it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves. i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size. so cute on.
3077	I have received so many compliments. it's my favorite
3078	I would suggest trying this on in store. the xs would've worked (that's my normal size), but i ended up preferring the s. it does have low armholes. the s in the yellow was just right for me, but the s in the navy was too low in the armholes and the shirt was cut a little crooked. still, a very cute and classic top that i know i'll get a lot of use out of.
3079	"Beautiful dress. loved the navy and the low v neck in front and back. but i had to return for smaller size. i am 5'2"" 114 lbs. i ordered small and it was a little big and definitely long. i returned for an xs petite and am hoping it will fit perfectly!"
3080	I ordered the stress in an xl. i usually wear a size 12 in most retailer clothes. the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small. also, i felt that i was choking. it is better suited for thin women.
3081	This cozy sweater has the feel of cashmere. it fits loose and has a similar look as a wrap or poncho. looks better over sleeveless or short sleeve tops. i'm surprised it isn't one size fits all b/c it is very generous in the xs/s, which i got and i'm a 6. i can see wearing this all year long, even summer cool nights. very classic style. the picture on website looks frumpy to me, but on it is very flattering.
3082	The pattern and color of this top are beautiful. when i saw the pattern, i knew i had to have it. the fit is a bit strange, short (which is fine for me as i am petite) and boxy. i bought it on sale and think its good value for the price. its a good late summer/early fall piece.
3083	This is one of my favorite recent retailer purchases. i wore it to work and a presentation. many people commented on how much they loved my top, and then turned back around to take a second glance to realize it wasn't paisley but leopards and tiger prints. it's really fun and fits well. great for work or dressed down with jeans.
3084	Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife, but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.
3085	"The picture is not a good representation of the cut and the fabric. the cut is a-line, trapezoid-shaped. the shirt is smallest in the shoulders and chest and then it flairs out to the sides. the cut works with pants mostly, you have to tuck the shirt in if wearing with skirts. the lace back drapes beautifully and is a little longer than the front, which again lend to wearing with skinny pants and such. the fabric has a quality of freshly starched. pleasant surprise. it lacks softness of leisure"
3086	Very cute and would transition well season to season with different boots/booties.  didn't lay well on chest for me.  returned it.
3087	"These are my favorite tights. i love how they are opaque. i love that they are thick but not so thick as to be only appropriate for winter. they are slimming without feeling too tight.  why don""t you sell these any more??? please bring them back!"
3088	"I ordered this dress in a size 12. i'm 5'9'' and 180lb. i usually wear size 14 but the 12 fit beautifully. the material has a nice stretch to it so that i think it would still fit whether i gained or loss 10 lbs. when i pulled it out of the box i immediately thought it read ""grandma"", but was pleasantly surprised when i put it on. it is snug in the waist and flares out nicely from there. it hits me on the knee exactly as it does the model in the picture. i plan on wearing this maybe for christma"
3089	This is a beautiful blouse however it runs big. i order the small and had to return it. my measurements are 5'4 135 34c-28-38 for reference. you will not regret buying this blouse but it has to be the right size if not it would look like it did on me, frumpy. i kept taking it off and putting it back on trying to make it work (because i liked the material that much) but if you look at the model she has her arms straight down. when i lifted my arms i had 3 inches of extra material on both side. th
3090	Just a lovely soft and easy cover piece. the back is so different and interesting.
3091	"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 143 lbs, and 38-32-40 and my normal size 10s fit me perfectly."
3092	This is a great layering tank that is super comfy! the sale price is a bargain!
3093	Love the look! it's a little tight but i still like it.
3094	"Bought this top on a whim on a tops sale and am really glad i did. it's a nice two-in-one piece that can be dressed up for the office with a blazer or down with jeans and a sweater. striped portion of the shirt is a ponte stretchy material. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the small was perfect and even roomy (i don't like things too tight)."
3095	Overall: a super comfy dress that you can wear anywhere. short, petite ladies beware though; the dress does not hang at your natural waist like it shows in the model's photos. in order for me to have it sit at my waist, the dress was folded over and did not flatter.
3096	I love this tunic! with that said the reason i only gave 4 stars over all was because the material wasn't what i was expecting. it's more like a thin sweater like material, with raw edge which normally is fine but i do worry about how long this will last. the design and colors are lovely! i have worn it with leggings and cropped jeans and it looks fantastic! great summer top/dress/tunic!
3097	I have a narrow face, and most coats with the big collars overwhelm me. this proportion is perfect. follows my shape without constricting but flows so well for a good line. color isn't quite laden green; it's more teal which works even better for me. so hard to find a wool coat these days that isn't bulky.
3098	Love the look of this and the fabric, but runs way small. i usually wear a 0. ordered the 0, then 2. just got the 4 and it's still too small. will be returning all 3.
3099	I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small, but returned and exchanged for a medium, which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall.
3100	I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment, it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.
3101	"I'm 5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress. one of these beauties ended up in our store and i had to try it on. the sleeves are no joke - serious bell sleeves that could have looked comical with the polka dots, but is surprisingly chic. the one i purchased was a medium - never had an opportunity to try a small, which i suspect is my actual size. buying it oversized made this magical. it feels modern. i actually think because the whole sweater is oversized on me, it makes the sleeves less cartoonish."
3102	Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small , and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium.
3103	I ordered the medium pink in a size small. the color is more of a hot pink. it runs small through the shoulders and bust (i'm 34-d). i like that it covers your bum and the detail down the back. but it is going back, i may try a medium petite in a different color.
3104	I ordered  flora nikrooz for my daughter for her wedding.  it is beautiful. the delivery was quick!!! very happy.
3105	Love this top! it has a beautiful appliquã© that is reminiscent of many past retailer favorites. it's comfy, yet cute and fashionable.
3106	Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit, more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.
3107	"Adorable! great for yoga or everyday use. can even fit a strapless bra under with no showing(i purchased the black). i'm 5'4"", usually a 6-8 and it fit great."
3108	I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small, but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine, yes, it is a little hard to zip up, but once on, it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i didn't sit and eat... we shall see. i don't plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling
3109	"Bought this dress for my daughter to wear to a rehearsal dinner and i couldn't believe how beautifully it fit. fitted through the top, falling to a gorgeous flare. hit her at knee (she's 5""6'). classic, elegant, femme fatale look that will work for a range of occasions."
3110	"I ordered the navy/green combo in xl and it's prettier in person. the fit matches the model so it's true to size for me. it is loose through the body. it's not slimming but not widening either. if you like how it looks on the model, that's how it should be when you try it on.  it's soft and flowy and perfect for feeling comfortable. i love how the arms and chest are more fitted. the material has give to it. the stitching everywhere was well-done, no loose strands. it's a great basic. i'm going t"
3111	I was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party, i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model (i am a more typical 50 year old mom body) and i have never worn a peplum style. i put it on for my husband and approved, so i wore it. i received many compliments - a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my 'comfort zone' with the style!
3112	I really like this top, the material is thicker than i thought which is a good thing! it fits me very well and is very comfortable. i definitely recommend this shirt!
3113	This is a classic! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style!!! love it!
3114	Yes, it runs very large. i usually wear a m and ordered the xs/s. i like the oversize fit and i think this poncho is unique, chic and modern. definitely worth the price, especially on sale. very nice quality fabric.
3115	Tried it on a whim and could not leave it behind. 5/4', 135, size 4-6, took a 6. something about the pocket placement, fabric weight, cut, and color make this one a real winner for me. plan to wear it with a creme windowpane coat.
3116	Beautiful,well made top.it just runs small not for me
3117	Very cool top! i purchased this in the black, which is more of a very dark gray (imagine sanded silk). it's very figure flattering and accentuates curves. it also disguises any minor tummy issues. not to clingy, but follows your form. the fabric is well made with a perfect drape to match the style. definitely a winner!
3118	The color is great. the fit is accurate and it is a great transitional piece.
3119	"I was so happy to discover that my size (00 petite) had suddenly become available again online--probably someone's return. and i wasn't disappointed when i tried the tunic on--it fit great (unlike other recent online purchases from retailer.) love the plaid and the style. the cut should flatter many body types. definitely worth the money!  please, retailer, expand your inventory in petite sizes. the cute stuff sells out so quickly."
3120	This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy, just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.
3121	My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store. this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture. it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter.
3122	"I would say the skirt runs two sizes too small. i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews, i purchased a large. i could barely get the skirt over my hips. even if it fit in the waist, it was much too short on me and i'm 5'2"". it's a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween."
3123	"This dress is gorgeous in person. it is so much softer than it appears the photo and the fabric moves well. what you can't see from the picture is that the bodice sort of overhangs the skirt by an inch or so which is really nice for accentuating a small waist and separates the top from the bottom in a cool way.   i am 5'6"" 135 lbs and curvy. 36-26-39 for reference. i ordered the 4 and it is loose although still flattering thanks to the forgiving cut. wish i had gotten a 2 but now they are sold"
3124	I love this suit, and have gotten so many compliments on it. i weigh 106-108 lbs. and ordered a s. typically i order xs but am glad i went with the size up. the coloring is beautiful. the legs are high cut / flattering. the top has no padding, and shows a seamless result. highly recommend!
3125	I purchased the violet chino's in my local store. the color to me is more plum than violet but a nice shade still. the fit was perfect and they are oh so comfortable. i bought size 27 (weight fluxes 116-118). i can see having several pairs of these in other colors because of the comfort level and they work for fall, spring and summer. in the warmer states even winter. the fabric has a soft feel to it.
3126	"Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo). sadly, it's going back."
3127	I really want to love this shirt, but the small is just way too big on me. for reference, i'm a 32d (which is why i didn't want to size down much more than a small), 5'6' and 125 and i'm drowning in this. i'm going to try it with different bottoms and ultimately will keep it because i do love the quality. just size down a couple of sizes!!
3128	This is my favorite kind of neckline. it is very flattering & cool for summer. my only complaint is the armpit scoops down a little too low. but i will just wear a bandeau underneath it. its super cute. will be great for vacationing & next summer.
3129	Love! received so many compliments! it can be dressed up or down and is so comfortable.  i did order a l  based on the reviews, but found it to be big.  i would've returned for a m, but it was sold out and i didn't want to risk not having it at all so i kept.
3130	Another beautiful mave piece!! that is too big!! waiting for the size down to come in the mail. fingers crossed this works. the large was too overwhelming on my 5'6 frame. the tank that comes with it is soft and comfy and the gold accents really make this an outstanding number!! too bad no petite is offered. i ordered the black but it was hard to choose because the white also looks amazing. i predict lots of cooing over this lovely!!
3131	"I tried this top in both colors. for the black, the lining looks much more peach in person. the main issue though is the diagonal line that runs through the middle of the top. you can see it in the picture, but is much more pronounced in person. it appears to be where 2 pieces of lace are sewed together and it just looks sloppy.  the line is much less obvious in the navy, and looks much more seamless, perhaps because there is a transition between two colors of lace. the black lining is completel"
3132	I was on the fence about ordering this jacket, but i'm so glad i did. i got my birthday discount to help afford it. as the first reviewer said, the weight is substantial, but not too heavy, and the embroidery is beautiful! i have not worn this jacket yet, but i expect to get many compliments when i do! i usually don't wear jackets in this style, so it's a fresh, new approach for me....the embroidery takes it to the next level! it fits true to size. i usually take a medium, and the medium fits pe
3133	"The colors are amazing, the fabric is beautiful; my only complaint is the cut. i am 5'8"" 130 lb and always a medium. i put the sweater on and the armhole area was short so it kept riding up- it almost fit like a petite with the higher cut in waist tailoring. i liked the sweater color and fabric so much i exchanged for a large."
3134	I wish that it had fit me better as the feel of the fabric and the color were great! regrettably, i am sending it back as the v opening is too low for my tastes and the fabric on the left of the first layer drapes weird on me. i am usually a s or m and in this top the s was plenty of length and room, would be swimming in a m. the fabric was soft and felt great against your skin and not thin as some fabrics can be. the color was just as shown and beautiful. hope it works for some of you out there
3135	I really like this jacket! it runs big, so you may want to size down. the fabric was softer than i was expecting, but i really like it. very cute fall jacket!
3136	This jacket is really cute. i tried in in a large in the store and was too big so i took a chance and ordered medium on line. i have broad shoulders so i was a bit worried. it's perfect. very fitted and cropped. but will look great to throw on over a dress. for reference i'm 5 foot 6 inches and a 34 c. 132lbs. slender but athletic. medium was perfect.
3137	This didn't work for me. it looks better unzipped. the piece made me look extremely top heavy, and i am by no means overweight, but i do have a larger chest on a small frame (36c, 5 feet, 115). honestly, it just made me look fat. the design is cute, but this is going back..
3138	I tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer.
3139	I love this tshirt, but the speckled grey looks more like roof shingles in person. i'm going to try to exchange it for a different color.
3140	It's a casual dress with a luxurious feel. very flowy, but the back panel gives it a bit more structure. i like that it graces my body without showing any lumps. i will very much appreciate it on hot days! i'm anticipating a big of headache when ironing it, but i appreciate that it's not dry clean only. i'm on the shorter side of average height and it hits me mid-thigh.
3141	This is such a cute vest. nice and cozy. so cute paired with a long sleeve tee, statement necklace, jeans and booties. very happy with my purchase!
3142	I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially, then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute, but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.
3143	"Since these are high waist pants, i think the size given is more for a lower waist measurement where most pants these days typically sit. i'm 5'10"", 150 lbs and ordered a size 31 but it was much too large. i love the style of these pants a lot. they look great if you have long legs, the size 31 ran about 5"" above my ankle, higher than is shown in the photos but it looks great."
3144	"This top had potential, but the cut is very boxy and not fitted at all like the front picture shows. the picture from the back is much more representative of what it looks like. i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s and the xs in this was still huge and boxy, but very short with tight sleeves (i have small arms so hardly ever have an issue with tight sleeves). the small fit better as far as length and and sleeves, but still very boxy. the pattern and cutouts are very cute, but thi"
3145	I ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner. i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height. i was for sure it would be too short in any other size. when i put it on i was drowning in it! i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal. has the potential to be super cute and flattering, yet the timing and sizing didn't work out. definitely give this one a try!
3146	"Regretfully, this dress is on its way back for an exchange. the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size, i ordered it in both colors, however, the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress, and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom. again, the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching, pulls , or tears for an exchange, but i can't pay 130"" for a dress that is already torn."
3147	"Like other ladies have mentioned, this dress runs small in the chest and waist region. you must size up! __________ pros: - flattering fit and flow. hides lumps and bumps. - cut at the neck and back is cute and didn't make me look chunky surprisingly. - little red polka dots aren't overwhelmingly at all and add a nice retro feel. - good overall length. - usa made! __________ cons: - runs small in the chest and waist. i'm a 36c, hourglass, 170 lbs and normally can wear a size 10 in tops"
3148	This sweater is very pretty. i had my concerns being that i don't normally pay $300.00 for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece. i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was. this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come.
3149	I just got this dress and am so excited to have it hanging in my closet, i've been eyeing it for a long time and am glad i got it on sale. i felt like a greek goddess when i tried this on and cannot wait to wear it. it fits like it was made just for me. the outer material is a little heavier than expected but it not a problem, the second layer is form fitting and soft. i feel like the restricted opening at the bottom forces me to slow down, like a lady and take in my surroundings, after all life
3150	I thought i would take a chance even though reviews suggested tricky sizing issues. unfortunately it's true, it was very tight at the waist and bust even though i sized up to a size 8. i took it back to the store.
3151	I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two.
3152	Perfect substitute for leggings to wear with a long shirt skirts or shorts. and are thick enough to keep you warm and aren't as thin as some tights normally are.
3153	These pants are lovely and comfortable, but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them, they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric, and thought i'd give it a try, but i didn't think it would be this bad. for the price, i expect better quality. also, they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low, it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher, closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6, 28/29 in b
3154	"I really love the colors of this dress - very unique and classy combo. little bit of a retro look to it. even though there is no zipper it's somehow fitted and flattering. i plan to wear it to a wedding this summer in the mountains where it gets chilly in the evening so i'm thrilled to find a summer dress with sleeves. it will work well for plenty of other occasions too. only problem is the buttons on the sleeves are nearly impossible to button. just too tight. for reference i'm 5'9"", 140 lbs an"
3155	The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it, and was mostly white, yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.
3156	This dress has a great design for any frame. it looks great with a belt to accentuate the waist but the dress stands great alone and doesn't require a lot of styling.
3157	The are so comfortable, flattering, and i feel i can wear them with a lot of styles: dress them up or down, it all looks good. great product! make more like this please!
3158	Unusual color. expensive even on sale.
3159	"I have this suit in the ""tile"" pattern and i love it. i am a breast cancer survivor and this suit is perfect for as it covers a little issue i have on the left. so i ordered the ""mint"" pattern. the colors are beautiful but the pattern is off. the ""v"" pattern on the front is not centered. as a result, my body looks a little lop-sided. i looked carefully at the suit on the model and noticed it was slightly off center on her also. however my suit is quite a bit off-center. it's too bad, because the"
3160	This is a classic pencil dress that would be becoming on most straight figures. i always wear a 6 (or medium) in hd, and this dress is a little large everywhere. i love it so much, i paid full price and i will probably have it taken in on the sides if possible. the lacework is gorgeous and sturdy - it doesn't catch on stuff. there is a lot of give to sit and move in, unlike most pencil dresses, and i cannot say enough about the color. wow, heads turn when you walk into a room in this gorgeous de
3161	"I was expecting an ivory/white cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit. i am 138 lbs, 36b and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m. the sweater is at least 1 or 2 sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fit.  the lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them. also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes. not unpleasant but not as pictured. as"
3162	"I love the color and textures of this jacket. the shawl color adds interest while being cozy and fun. wish it ran a tad longer. otherwise a great mix and match piece."
3163	I usually wear a s. the reviews were helpful. looking at the pic this shirt does look a little on the fitted side. i ordered a size m & it fits perfectly! the sleeve length is fine too! the colors are dark, not as in the photo. i do like the frayed edge look too. i have some skinnys like that. i had been looking at this shirt for months but thought it was a bit pricey. at the sale price plus the promo discount it makes it very much worth it. no regrets. hope this isn't tmi.. of note: the dark bl
3164	I totally disagree with previous reviewer on sizing. i am usually a medium (sometimes small) in various retailer tops and i purchased this top in a small. i could barely get it over my head. i then ordered the medium and large. i tried the large on first and it fits perfectly. (like the model shot). so i would say this definitely runs small. i never wear a large. for reference, i am 36c, broad shoulder. the gold beading on the top is very pretty and the gold embroidery thread really pops. t
3165	"I was so excited to receive this jacket - have been looking for a ""leather"" jacket for a while and thought this would be the perfect one. unfortunately, i have broad shoulders and it seemed a little tight. i got my normal size s based on retailer shirts. maybe if i got the m? although, the s fit well in the waist, so... also, my small chest (32b) didn't fill out the darting in the chest area. one last wish, was that it was a little longer.  as with all hei hei, the inner lining was very cute. ove"
3166	I just received the acacia swing tank and when i pulled it out, i felt like it was christmas day all over. it hangs nicely and felt luxurious on my skin. even my husband was dazzled. the detailing of the flowers is delicate and feminine. the cutaway gives you a sexy, casual chic appearance that you can dress up or down. i can't wait to unveil this new piece at work.
3167	"I was very hesitant about this. i read the previous reviews and thought oh no. the first time i saw it in person i was mildly disappointed because the material wasn't how i thought it would be. then i saw it up close, and i realized it was better than i thought. however, i didn't have time to try it on.  it wasn't until later when i saw it on someone else that i realized i was looking at a must have. i am so happy i purchased this. its beautiful and flattering and the colors are bright yet und"
3168	I love this top! i've already worn it 3 times since getting it about 2 weeks ago. it is beautiful and has a lovely, subtle pattern to the fabric that i didn't initially see in the photo, but then did and still wanted it. it has a nice drape and is comfortable and flattering. my only critique is that it comes up a little shorter on my torso than i expected. i am a medium/size 8 with 34d bust and the top comes to maybe 2 inches below my belly button. i think it's still flattering and comfortable,
3169	Absolutely gorgeous shirt. the quality is outstanding! only problem is that it is too small. i am usually a perfect size 6 and this will not zip. returning for a size 8. you won't regret buying it!
3170	The dress is pretty, i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran, i took both back the neck is too tight!
3171	I cant say enough about this top. the material is soft and comfy . very well made. the length and  size is spot on! looks great tucked in or out! very versatile. highly recommend!!
3172	This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.
3173	Chambray top that is soft, but thick/heavy so it drapes well and is very flattering on. untucked, the top is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it hangs like a tunic, almost a-line so do not size up or you will have too much material. i am a sz small in most retailer clothing, and the sz 2 fit nicely. sz 4 was too loose around my arms, and the sz 0 was too tight around my chest. nice neckline and a pop of surprise with the gorgeous lace detail in the back.
3174	"I really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great. however, the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy. i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft, not my 5'6"" self."
3175	"I went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress, and i'm so glad i did. the fit was perfect. i'm always a little hesitant about long dresses since i'm 5'2"", but the petite length was perfect. the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable, but i feel elegant in it. i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month."
3176	I'm 5-months pregnant and wanted some beautiful tunics to mix it up between the usual maternity wear. this top is lovely! i love the cut, length and embroidered details however i am not a fan of the side slits. this will work much better post partum so i plan to keep it but my belly currently pulls the slits a bit awkward.
3177	I bought this tank on a whim without trying it on in the store, in black. the detail on the front is cute and the peplum is really cute without being frumpy at all. i am usually a small, ocassionally a medium in retailer shirts and i bought this in small. it fits but i feel like i could have gone up to a medium, it's just a little tight across the chest, but i do have more broad shoulders than most so maybe it's just because of that. the fabric is nice and stretchy, so i might be able to get away
3178	"This is absolutely adorable and so flattering! i have the patterned shirt, and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much. i am 5 ft. 9"" and 155 lbs. and the medium fits nicely. hope this helps!"
3179	This is one of the most flattering tops i've ever owned. i'm a little confused by the other reviews, because the model in the photo doesn't have it tacked in the back. you can see on the photo of the back, there's a button to pull it in which makes it so incredibly flattering. it's soft and beautiful, but very delicate. i'd wash it separately and carefully, and rarely :) i actually had to return my first one because of a hole in the material. overall, one of my new favorite tops.
3180	I love this shirt. i ordered a large because i am taller, and i wanted the length to be right. while it's a little baggy, it's still very flattering and i've received lots of compliments on it. the color is exactly what is show in the image. it's a versatile shirt; depending on what you pair it with it can be appropriate for work, dinner, or a night out. i'd definitely recommend this shirt to a friend.
3181	This is a beautiful dress. the detail is amazing, but it runs a little small. i'm usually size 0, but i had to go up a size in this dress. its cut a little too tight, and there is no give in the fabric. otherwise its stunning!
3182	This blouse is very unique due to the pretty piped design on the back. looks great with jeans. the front is shorter and more tailored than the back. i love this blouse!
3183	I have two of these tops. the maroon and tan and white stripe. the material is great and the neckline lays great. it isn't too thick so i can wear it on cooler florida days. you can dress it up under a jacket or dress down with some jeans.
3184	A truly unwearable slip: scratchy fabric, bunchy skirt, teeny bodice. it feels like you are wearing wrapping paper--the foil kind.
3185	"This top takes every other tee and blows it out of the water! it appears subtle on the hanger, but it looks so lady like on! the flutter sleeve are darling. the top does have a lot of volume, but the drape is so lovely, it adds some shape. it is perfect to wear everyday and dress up! i bought to wear with the bryden skirt. for reference, i purchased ordered the xs (though i am wearing a s in the photo) and i am 34c, 26"" waist. the shoulder fit okay with easter size, but there was a little less v"
3186	This sweater is much prettier in person than in the picture. the colors are soft and feminine. medium fit me perfectly. this is the soft, cuddly sweater i have been looking for.
3187	This is so adorable and flattering. dress it up or down with a denim jacket weekday to weekend.w/flats or pumps. love this cute dress. not all wool so it's not itchy at all. the colors are vibrant and would compliment any complexion!
3188	Long enough to wear without leggings but also great with them. i also purchase the belt pictured and it looks as good in person as it does in the photo!
3189	This shirt is so soft and luxuriously feeling. the material looks very nice and seems well made. it has a nice length to it, so it can be worn properly with leggings without any worry. i'm a 36d and can't get the button to close properly, so i'd recommend sizing up if this could be an issue for you. overall it will be a very versitile piece i'm excited to add to my wardrobe.
3190	Super cute dress for fall. detail is much more intricate than what you are able to see online. not too long and will look perfect with tights and boots.
3191	This is a cute casual dress that could be worn with flip flops or boots.
3192	"Ig and the first reviewer convinced me to buy this top. it was styled so beautifully with jeans and shorts on two different retailer associates, i wanted to see if i could pull it off too. unfortunately my body type and shortness makes the it look like i'm wearing short peasant skirt as a top.  really disappointed since the top is soft, beautiful, vibrant silk! maybe i will keep since i'm losing weight and will try it on again. generally i wear size m/l and i'm 5'3"" 135# 38-28-35. purchased this c"
3193	Absolutely in love with this top. the embroidery and back button detail make for a unique and fun look. light and airy material will be perfect in warmer weather with a cute pair of shorts. i got a size small and it fits perfectly. measurements: 5'4, 135lbs, 32e
3194	Love these! i'm about 5'4, and they fit right at the ankle. the slit gives them a little more detail than regular jeans. i've worn them several times, and they haven't stretched out at all. perfect for spring.
3195	I missed out on the sherpa vest in caramel last year and didn't want to miss out again - can't wait to wear this when it gets chilly. i am between a s & m but the small was very comfortable. it could be easilly layered over a thicker item, or a t-shirt as pictured. so glad i picked this one up.
3196	Great fabric, great fit, great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!
3197	This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.
3198	I love these pjs! i thought $100 for the set was a little too pricey for me but as soon as they went on sale i knew i had to have them! they are so light and fresh, perfect for the texas heat! it helps that the print is absolutely precious as well!
3199	This top is exactly what i was expecting. super comfortable while still looking stylish. just covers your bum so you can wear it with leggings or jeans!
3200	"I meant to order this online and forgot. i was very happy when i was able to get it in one of the stores yesterday. it's everything a summer dress should be: flowy, lightweight and a great print. i can't believe there's no reviews and that it still available in every size. for reference i got a small i am 5'4""  135. this dress i thought would make me look wide because it's all straight across but in fact it really has a great flow and is cut well. grab it while you can."
3201	Love this top! tried it on in store...so glad i did since it runs large and i had to size down to a medium. the color is a beautiful camel and the material is soft...very grateful the fabric content did not contain dreaded wool, lol! therefore leaving it soft and comfortable to wear...the price tag was a bit much considering it is only a sweater vest but with retailer price equals quality so i don't mind spending the extra $!
3202	This dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it. i love absolutely anything with a full shape, and this dress has it! its cut like a circle...so ladies this dress has a lot of fabric. i'm 5'8 and wouldn't be able to wear it as a dress, but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings. the arms are a tad more fitted (though i have larger arms) which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine. if you love a cool quirky piece, this one is a winner!
3203	Bought these and they fit really well and are super comfy. love the color. will probably live in them this summer!
3204	"It is seldom that i write a review about a tee, but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today, i just felt compelled to do so! the deal is, this tee is pricey for sure, but in my opinion, it is worth it! as another reviewer said, the cotton fabric is hefty; in fact, it could also be called a ""lightweight sweater."" everything about this tee is perfect and classic: the elbow sleeves, the nice neckline, and the semi-boxy, semi-cropped fit. it will go with everything from jeans, to nice slacks"
3205	"Wow, i didn't think this dress would work on my curvy frame. i still have a baby belly and some dresses look like mumu's on me. this was so flattering, the waist cinches nicely and the length is just above the knee. i am 5.6"" and 145lbs for reference. the weight its light/cottony and it looks great with flats and wedges.  love it!"
3206	Great boyfriend style jeans. run large, though - i had to order a size down.
3207	I love dolan dresses! the fabrics are always beautiful, and the colors are always unique. i usually wear an xs petite in dolan, but i ordered both the xs and the xs petite, and i think i'm going to keep the xs. i had a hard time deciding which to keep, but the xs petite was just a hair too short. i think this is a versatile dress for all seasons. you could pair it with tights in fall/winter, but it is great for spring/summer, too...
3208	"Bought this as ""transitional"" wear post baby #2 & i love them! will probably end up wearing them all winter long! i love that i'm 6 foot & they still are scrunchy at the bottom which i honestly wasn't expecting."
3209	"First of all, i'm not a ""navy"" person at all. i much prefer black or other bright colors. i received an e'mail showing this trench last saturday and i pulled it up online and noticed how darling it looked. i didn't order it, but i went back the following day to check it out again. it was nowhere on the website. then a few days ago, back it popped up online again. i noticed it wasn't in my local store so i thought i'd go in and look this weekend. i just had to see it. i actually made it to the st"
3210	"I read all reviews and i decided to try as the price was great. first of all i am 5'6"" 145 lbs, athletic build (not skinny but have muscles). the sweater fits great, just like glove, it does not make me look fat. the quality is great,sweater is warm, cozy and well-made. i am not sure about color as it's brighter as it shown. it is not quite coral, it's a little bit darker which will make it difficult to match it with. the sleeves run small so if you are taller then me just keep it in mind. th sw"
3211	I bought this top in the store, which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold, tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.
3212	"Really cute dress for work. fits exactly as i expected. this dress is very comfortable and looks put together on days when you're being lazy and just want to ""throw something on""."
3213	"The shirt looks a lot less fitted on the model in the picture than how it fit in ""real"" life. size was not wrong, the material was just very clingy. i was not impressed and subsequently returned it."
3214	This dress makes me this of jackie kennedy on the beach in the summertime. i love the pattern and the pockets, oh my goodness the pockets! i saw this in the store and ordered one while i was there online because the ribbon on the zipper was frayed. well guess what we i got it in the mail at home the ribbon was also frayed. ugh. i kept it because it wasn't a huge deal breaker. the color is a little strange, not a true red more of a orangish red. i think it's super versatile and hopefully i will w
3215	Extremely pretty swimsuit, gorgeous cut in the front with the lace and the floral print, very flattering to hourglass shapes. coverage across rear end is a bit less than i would prefer, but it's so very pretty that i'm keeping it. several comments from friends that this could be worn as a tank top for regular wear it is so pretty.
3216	I love the fabric of this dress and the way it fits, but it is too low for me i thought about putting a cami under it, but that would ruin the look of the dress. just an inch or so higher would have been much better. as much as i like the design and fit, i will be returning this dress.
3217	Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.
3218	"I am 5'2"", 110 lbs and i ordered my usual size xs and they fit perfectly. they are so soft and comfortable and keep me very warm. i can't wait to take them with me when we go to the snow next month!"
3219	After reading the reviews, i was hesitant to purchase, but glad i did. i'm usually an xs or s depending on the brand, but i got this in a xxs. it fits perfectly and is so cute. does not look like a bathrobe at all. i love it because it's almost like a cardigan blazer...looks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan!
3220	This dress is simply gorgeous. the slit is just right, the colors are great, and most of all the fabric is very comfy! i highly recommend!
3221	This pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin. i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool doesn't bother me too much. i'm not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress, even with the slip, which doesn't cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off. i decided to keep and wear as an autumn/winter dress in which i will remove the slip, wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea
3222	I absolutely adore this top!!! i got it in the blue and went back a few days later and got the gray as well. it's super soft and casual but still really cute. it's a little long (i'm 5'4) but i tuck in the front or tie a knot on the side and it looks good. i wish they had more colors so i could have a few more of these!
3223	Usually wear stevie jeans from ag but wanted to try something different. now i love farrah!
3224	I am tall and typically wear a size 10/12, so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted. but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a cover-up than a tunic. it fits like a poncho. with my arms at my sides, it fit me similar to the model picture. but if i lift my arms (to use them), then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me. the reason for that is that it doesn't really have sleeves - it's more like hol
3225	"Loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on. it's a gorgeous shade of blue (denim, not navy) with some light tie-dye streaking along the top and sides which add interest. the ""bat wing"" feature is a little limiting; i won't be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me. as for the material, it's an interesting blend bc it isn't soft or rough. some may say it's itchy and some may say it's soft, to me it isn't either. it's merely smooth enough. which sounds terrible, ""it"
3226	I just love this dress - so comfortable and flattering. maeve has had some great dresses this summer, but this one may be my favorite. this one could easily been worn in to fall with a sweater or jacket.
3227	I was apprehensive because of the long tail at the back of this shirt, but it is very pretty with capris.
3228	Great fit, looks excellent with jeans as well as tucked in with a pencil skirt.
3229	I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.
3230	"I found this in-store when looking for a dressy, slightly boho dress for an upcoming wedding. i'm really happy with it -- the a-line cut disguises some recently gained extra pounds but it doesn't feel like i'm hiding in a muumuu because the shoulders and chest are relatively fitted. the flowy hemline offsets the short length (maybe 4-5"" above the knee for me). the pink color is very light -- lighter than in the photos, i think -- but it will work nicely for the wedding. as the first reviewer sai"
3231	Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite, might work on someone taller.
3232	"It's a pretty, low-key, no fuss skirt. i prefer the ivory color because the details are more visible (there are different designs in the same hue). the zipper is very thick and sturdy, a bonus. size 2 regular fit me well, the hem falls right above my knees (i'm 5'2"", 26 waist, 36 hips), perfect for work and play. a touch of linen keeps the fabric cool for summer, but it doesn't wrinkle. for the price and the name like ""thera,"" i expect more flair to match its mediterranean name. for those who do"
3233	They're the same quality and fit as my hyphens from last year. easy purchase!
3234	This dress is so beautiful it makes me feel like a goddess, lol. i'm normally a 10/12 or m/l and took a 12. i think the 10 would have worked too. everything from the colors, fit and flow of the dress is wonderful. i didn't have any problem with there being too much fabric as some of the reviews mentioned.
3235	I purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking. though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust. and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy. for a looser fit you may want to size up. for a more fitted look it is true to size.
3236	I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it, but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children's book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it.
3237	"I am 5'2"", 120lbs. and bought the 4 petite, which is what i normally wear, and it fits perfectly. the quality of the fabric and stitching is good, not great, and more what i would expect to see in a less expensive garment, but for me, the style, the fit and the fact that it doesn't seem to show wrinkles, at least not before washing, turned it in to a keeper for me. the drawstring ties in the back and i find it a little weird when you wear a belt with it. i tried the ada belt with it, but found i"
3238	This is a great dress from moving to summer into fall. it's great right now with the warm temps, but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit. it's very comfortable also. there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front. i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through. maybe, you can adjust it at the straps some. at any rate, it's a nice dress and i'm keeping it.
3239	I wasn't sure how to rate the fit on these. i tried my normal 12 and the waist fit pretty well- but there's a lot of room in the hip/pelvis area. i tried a 10 but the waist didn't fit. i can see these gathering when i sit- but i just love the print. there is no stretch in these, either. i have slim legs- if you don't, i would size up or just pass. the calf is tight.
3240	"Not my typical sleepwear, but glad that i took a chance, as it is super cozy for lounging. i was worried about covering my bottom (as i purchased the matching leggings), and ordered s based on prior reviews. ended up exchanging for xs as it was too oversized. could have purchased the petite probably as xs is still a bit long (5'2""), though fits like in photos."
3241	I really love this brand and i love the fit of this blazer. my bottons were loose on this jacket and i got the rose color too and i do agree with the other reviewer that the color is more terra-cotta. great for spring and cool summer night. it runs tts im a 36dd and the medium fit nice.
3242	"Lovely pants, incredibly comfy fabric, but too short for 5'11'' people. stated inseam of 31.5 is a bit understated, but it is clearly not 34"" that i need. had to take it back to the store."
3243	This t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything. my only concern is the fabric is super light. not enough to be see through, but just enough to make me question the quality. i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though. the drape is nice and not super revealing; discreet enough for work. i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile.
3244	I was not expecting to like this. i tried it on in the store on a whim. it happened to drape beautifully. this will be a great work dress for the summer with something underneath the bring up the neckline. the blue color is soft and pretty.
3245	Runs a tad big but not enough to say it runs large if that makes sense - but just beautiful!
3246	"This top is everything it promises to be. i read other reviews and purchased a small (i'm typically between an x-small/small depending on the day of the week) and was glad i did. a medium would definitely have been too big but the small fit perfectly. i have a shorter torso (5'3""/117 pounds) so i didn't experience any apprehension about my stomach showing. i paired it with a pair of skinny black ankle pants and a pair of navy and grey d'orsay heels. it worked wonderful and i can't wait to pair i"
3247	I agree with the other reviews - runs small. would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable. waistband doesn't stretch all the way around. bummer.
3248	I got the floral suit and honestly, it's the most beautiful bathing suit i have ever owned. i have yet to wear it to the pool or beach so i don't know how it holds up when getting wet. i can see where other reviewers have said there is no support in the chest. it is padded which is nice, but no underwire or anything to hold the girls up. if you are big chested this could be an issue - not so much for me. :) looking forward to wearing this suit when the weather gets warmer!
3249	This dress is very cute on. very flouncy. i know it looks like a gingham dress, but it's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern. the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size (bug or small), and i am larger on top, so i don't know what would happen with someone with a small chest. i wouldn't have minded if it did the same thing on the front, but it was just the back.
3250	I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price, but the design really spoke to me. i've been waiting for an off the shoulder piece that i love, and this was it. great, light fabric and beautiful design. i love it. worth every penny. can be worn on or off the shoulder like pictured.
3251	"Just got these mara hoffman classic bikini bottoms in flight azure print.today and love them: high quality, fully lined and reversible. the pattern placement is perfectly symmetrical and the colors are just like the online photos. . i think the size chart on the mara hoffman site is correct for where the bottoms sit on my body, above the widest part. i have a a-shape with smaller waist and hips, full behind and thighs (currently 33-25-37ish, 38"" at the widest which is at my thighs). in these t"
3252	I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it, but i could not. there were spots missing sequence, some fell off as i tried the dress on, and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly, for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes.
3253	Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.
3254	"I am so happy with this jumpsuit! it is the perfect comfortable and casual summer outfit. the fabric is super soft. i was unsure about the length at first because it's shorter than my other jumpsuits, but if you scrunch up the bottom of the legs and add some sandals, it's a great look.  highly recommend!"
3255	I'm really excited that retailer is selling basics. i love the flow of this fabric and it does not cling. i haven't worn them yet but they'll be perfect for work. i look forward to trying on the other essential styles.
3256	"I have been eyeing this dress online for a while but never could justify the price. well, when it went on sale, i couldn't pass up the opportunity. it arrived today and is even better than i expected. very flattering cut, long enough for tall people (i'm 5'10"") and beautiful colors.   i ordered s (my usual size in retailer dresses, i'm 145 lbs, 36c) and it fits perfectly. this will definitely be my go-to dress for the rest of the summer. i love all my retailer dresses but sometimes find them a tad"
3257	This is perfect! it fits tts. i am usually an 8 and this was spot on. it isn't too short either. it really is as it appears on the model. i absolutely love it and can't wait to wear it. my hubby definitely approved!
3258	It's very beautifully designed, simple but elegant. material is thick and soft so it makes good shape. color is a little different from picture but it didn't disappoint me because everything else is so good.
3259	Classic and stylish. trendy with the blocking...rich colors, soft and comfy. i typically wear s and s was perfect. i love this sweater.
3260	Love the fabric, print, and cut! it's a smidge low in the neckline, but that's probably because i'm busty. nice and breezy for our blazing hot and humid florida summers.
3261	I have a curvy figure, and this top is not for me. it fits loose at the top and is tight at the bottom. it is also short. i think this top works best on slender figures.
3262	"I love this dress, the print is beautiful, the fabric has a nice heavy drape and the cut is simple but unique. i'm short and curvy so generally shapeless dresses don't work on me, this is an exception.  i ordered the regular instead of the petite and it is full length on me, which i think i like more than if it were a midi.  the armholes do cut in, i wasn't sure if i liked that until i sized down and it fit closer.  my husband chuckled that it's a little mrs. roper... i don't care, i'm wea"
3263	I really loved how this top looked and was really excited it to get it on sale. i was worried that it might be too small/tight (i ordered a m and would consider myself a m) but was relieved to find it fit just fine. i was extremely disappointed to find that it was too sheer to wear by itself and still showed my bra with a layering tank on underneath. it was also more like a crop top for length, which does not work with my mama belly.
3264	This dress is nice, but it won't do for my purpose. i considered it for a mother of the groom dress, but it's not long enough for me. the dress is pretty, but very sheer and very low cut so it would require opaque undergarments. it's not possible to tell from the pictures how sheer this dress is.
3265	I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed, because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived, it was sold out in my size. now, i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged, i would recommend this product.
3266	I'm extremely pleased with the quaiity of these leggings. the material is comfortable and supportive without feeling too restrictive. the pattern ans styling are slimming. most importantly, they don't slide down during your workout! i'm 5'8'' and a size 12-14 and the large fit perfectly.
3267	This is a great casual shirt that works great for a day at the beach and is also comfortable enough to wear to sleep. wore this shirt to school one day with an undershirt underneath and wore it again hiking several days later with just a sports bra underneath.
3268	I ordered a small and i'm usually always a small. i could not zip it up. i'm am returning it for a large, and this is concerning because what if it is big in a weird way because i'm usually a large?
3269	I originally bought these jeans in my true size. after wearing them a few times i realized they stretched out quickly making it hard to wear them again. retailer recommended i go down a size and now they are my favorite jean!  they are a little tight for the first 5 mins, and then they are perfect fit wear after wear. and so soft!
3270	I bought this dress in store today in a size 4, i usually wear an 8 (so i was thrilled) the print and details are gorgeous but it's a very wide swing dress, there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist. i'm going to wear this with a belt so it's fine but the images online are a little misleading.
3271	Fantastic quality. i agree the material is heavier and may be too hot for summer in sc but will be perfect for ac cooled offices. the fit is tts. i am smaller on top than the bottom and size 2 fit well everywhere thanks to the somewhat stretchy material, 32-24-36. i never write reviews but this dress really is fantastic and at a great price point given the high quality of the fabric and design. i couldn't tell from the pics but the back bottom is not a single center slit but a double slit. i rea
3272	"Very pretty blouse. it does run quite large, i am usually an xs-s or 0-4 and purchased the 0. i could probably have gone to a 00. for reference i am 5'4"" 118 lbs 34b/c. it says that it is dry clean only, however i washed in in delicate cycle with cold water and threw in the dryer for a little bit. it came out perfect! i was hoping to shrink it and it only shrunk a tiny bit. i was hoping for it to shrink more but it is fine. no need to even iron it! i was lucky enough to get it on sale, i don't t"
3273	"Loved the dress on-line. ordered a petite small. fits perfectly. i am barely 5'5"" and carry my weight in hips and thighs. this fits perfectly without being too snug on the butt!! so, if you are a pear shape, get this dress!!"
3274	"I bought these shorts in my usual size small (4-6) 38"" around hips/butt. they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way, especially given the drapey fabric they're made out of. the print is gorgeous, especially at the waistband. you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off. the red is a true bright red but beautiful. the waistband has a functional drawstring. i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying. i would not put these in a dry"
3275	More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid
3276	Everyone should have this blouse, amazing! simply love it! it does run large, so purchase down 1-2 sizes.
3277	This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut, but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me, so had to go back.
3278	"I ordered xs petite. which they are sold out of. but in case you are a different size i wanted to write a review. i'm 5 feet tall and 120 lbs. i am 34  d so busty. the petite did not overwhelm me. the pockets do open. you're supposed to cut the little threads out. ask a dry cleaner or an retailer stylist for help. i like that there is a little ""stiffness"" to the cape. it has holes for your arms. not a poncho. your lucky if they have your size!"
3279	I really love cloth & stone, and this top did not disappoint. i am usually a size small in tops but tend to be an xs in halters because the arm holes are usually big on me. i went with my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it has a nice drape to it and is super soft. i will add that when looking at the picture, i didn't notice that there is a muted pink to the plaid design. i originally thought it was just a navy blue and white plaid. however, there is a really light pink to it as well. i actually w
3280	This top looks just like you see it on the website - design is super cool and color is awesome, almost acid washed in areas. but know that this top is super, super thin and will not provide any warmth. i wish it were a bit thicker in fabric, it would have been perfect for the cool fall and going into winter especially for the price. the medium in this one fit me better than the small. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.
3281	This skirt fits true to size and sits on the natural waist nicely. i've paired it with black, and the contrast is very nice. the material is thick enough for winter, but will also work for the fall months, too.
3282	I got this dress for my younger sister who's in the process of losing weight. she's currently wearing a size 12 with comfort room but can occasionally squeeze into smaller sizes depending on the product. this dress is deceptively true to size. at first glance it looks like a roomy dress but the inner part of the dress zips up real tight. as a result, the boxy top part of the dress doesn't look too big and is in fact very flattering. the dress is very silky and looks as high quality as its price.
3283	"I love these pants. a dry cleaner lost my favorite black pair ten years ago. i have not used them since. if you wait long enough, everything comes back in style. i bought black and rust. these pants are comfortable, the perfect length, can dress up or down and are very, very cute."
3284	I just tried this top on in xs regular even though i generally wear xspetite in retailer and it fit great (34aa - 26 - 34). i think it's flattering on my fairly straight body with the halter neck, fitted waist and peplum. i would guess it would be flattering on many body types; it highlights shoulders beautifully. it was very hard to get my head through the small, not-too-stretchy opening so you may want to try it on without makeup. i knocked off one star because the neck band wasn't symmetrical,
3285	This dress came with two pieces, a black sheath slip and a sheer pattern top-piece (pictured). it's pull-on and comfortable and flows well. i ordered online but wish i could have selected the pattern, as the fabric differs a little from front to back both in the pattern and intensity of color. overall though, a comfortable, light summer dress.
3286	I loved almost everything about this skirt. thick and lined and love the buttons. comfortable. the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom, presumably from the buttons. i was torn, but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back.
3287	Very comfortable to wear, love the overall look of this dress.
3288	I ordered this top (black) in both small and medium; i can get usually away with small at retailer but am size medium in all other stores. as soon as i received the package and opened it up, i knew i would keep this top. it has a gorgeous texture to it, a slight sheen, and is well made. it's extremely comfortable as a t-shirt would be, but has more structure and looks very chic. the waist nips in just enough to give the flutter hem a little flare at the hips and is very feminine. i have a long tor
3289	I saw this top and loved the pattern. meadow rue is one of my favorite brands for tops at retailer. the pattern is lovely and the fit it tts. this top is comfortable for running errands and can be dressed up too. very versatile for spring.
3290	It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however, i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however, i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.
3291	"My first review and first full price designer denim purchase....  i recently lost weight and in need to replace all my pants and in search of a dark wash high rise jeans (preferably in black), finally decided to buy this at full price online coz of all the fab reviews. i decided to purchase the 25p, thinking that i may return after receiving it in the mail since i wasn't able to try at the store and not sure if i got the right size, also it's not the high rise denim that i was looking for. but t"
3292	I love floreat and was excited to find this top on sale. i received multiple compliments the first day i wore it. it is true that it might be better with a bit less fabric but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. the flowy shape it ideal for summer.
3293	"I bough a green, size s (140lbs., 34b, 5'8). the sweater is true to size: it hits at my low hip and, although it is cut generously, it is cut close to the body. the ""green"" color is very pretty and true to the monitor depiction of a bright turquoise. the material is very soft and definitely high-quality cashmere with no itch factor. however, the knit of the yarn is very chunky, which means that this is not a slimming garment. moreover, since i have long arms, the bell sleeves do not reach my wri"
3294	Love the weight. something i can wear winter and spring.
3295	"This blazer is beautiful. it runs tts. it is lightly lined with an off-white poplin. in the body of the jacket, the off-white lining is an adorable swiss dot. though the lining makes the lace portions of the jacket not completely see through, a darker shirt would still show through. the detail is amazing - from the adorable buttons to the variations in the fabric texture. i am 5'5"", and the fit (as far as length) is very similar to what is shown on the model. the sleeves are a little on the long"
3296	Nice loose-fitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall. i had no problem with the slip being too tight. 5'3'', 118lbs, and went with my normal size 2. it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders. it's great with boots or flats!
3297	I loved this purchase. the dress is beautiful. it?s classy, very feminine and rich-looking. the colors and fabric are exactly as shown on a picture. it is tailored and non-stretch, so size has to be right. i am between 6 and 8 and my size m dress fits well. had to spend time shopping for a belt as the dress definitely needs one. gorgeous dress!
3298	I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small, especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately, the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.
3299	Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large, but lean towards xl when things don't have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn't squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn't want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far, i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos, the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he
3300	I was on a mission at retailer to find a versatile and comfortable jacket/cardigan. this is perfection. the detail and pattern in the wool make it unique and the zipper and snaps are great quality. i bought it in the green and is great for the office and out in jeans as well.
3301	"These pants are simply darling! i purchased them with my birthday discount (thank you, retailer!) and even without a discount i think they are worth every penny. flattering, and the most important feature of any pant, makes my butt look good. don't hesitate, buy these today before they are out of stock.   the fit is true to size and the material is of excellent quality."
3302	The sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area. i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately. it truly is a great tank top!
3303	I love a good white blouse and this shirt does not disappoint. the detailing of the lace and bead work make it extra special. i just love it. it can be dressed up or worn with jeans. it runs a bit wide. i normally don't buy a petite in tops because i am long in the body but i did with this one after i tried the regular.
3304	Simple blazer with cute details - buttons on the back and lining. this will look good both in the office over over a pair of jeans and booties. i was able to go with the regular size (instead of petite) because i will wear with the sleeve rolled up.
3305	"Around 5 years ago, i bought 4 pairs of ""daughters of the liberation"" brand (very similar style) shorts at retailer, and have been repairing any and all frayed fabric in the first two pair, in a lighter material than the second two pair, ever since, in order to preserve my #1 favorite shorts. thank goodness pilcro - another longtime fave brand of pants available at retailer - came through this year with these very similar, but perhaps even nicer, shorts. i bought the yellow striped pai"
3306	I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.
3307	I love this blouse. the lace panels are slightly sheer, but nothing inappropriate. the solid fabric is a lovely sort of heavy crepe. stunning bright cobalt blue color. i'm an xl in retailer and this top fit well in xl; ever so slightly snug at one part on the sleeve but nothing noticeable or uncomfortable. be aware, this did bleed blue when it was soaking and it did drip blue water while it was air drying on the hanger. while this blouse is still wet i would stretch out the sides and sleeves to ge
3308	I ordered these hoping they would look like the model - but they didn't. i am small but curvy. it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly, these pants are going back.
3309	I love the style of this top, and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty, and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes, unfortunately they cut the armholes really big, so when you put your arms forward, the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway, but for $98 dollars i thin
3310	I love this dress. the pattern is super cute and looks great with a jean jacket and comfy sandals or white sneakers. tons of compliments!!
3311	These are gorgeous and not too short or too long which is oddly hard to find! they're mostly tts, but if you're between sizes i'd go up a size because the small was slightly snug on me and i'm a 4/6. i'm hopeful that they'll stretch a little with wear because i think the medium would be too loose.
3312	Super cute but the fabric was so thin & flimsy i was afraid it would fall apart once it was washed so returned it.
3313	Unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle). also, there are no bra-straps holders, and my bra straps did show up a lot...
3314	This top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price. it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it. also, the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt. still, the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans.
3315	These pants are beautiful and so comfortable. the liner is a nice surprise. they can be casual or dressed up with a jacket. i'm so pleased to have gotten them on sale!
3316	"I picked this up this weekend. so gorgeous! i usually don't do maxi length. at 5'3"" it can be overwhelming. but this is so flattering! this is floor length on me. i picked up a couple tops at another store because the suggested sweaters were just too baggy for my frame. i'll pair it with a cream blouse (pictured) to dress up and a pink crepe blouse and denim jacket for a more casual look. i'm usually a 4 and the small fits perfectly."
3317	Flowing top that looks great with skinny slacks... makes a great and comfortable work outfit.
3318	I love this tee! while it is true to size i feel, it is meant to have a loose fit. that being said, it is a very flattering cut and has a great drape. super comfy, flattering and classic.
3319	So nice. lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs. will look stylish on all heights. very impressed with the styling and construction. fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage.
3320	I am 5'3' and 120 lbs for reference, and pear shaped and this dress in a 4 petite fit like a glove. granted, not a dress i would want to gain weight in, but fit perfectly. usually i am a 2 in retailer dresses but read other reviews and definitely made the right choice. it hits at a very flattering length even for someone as short as i am.
3321	"The blouse is lovely - i loved the lace, color (though just as other reviewers mentioned its a darker blue closer to a teal color) and edging. i am very petite, for reference, 5'2"", 24 waist and 30e and normally wear a 00 or 00p. the 00 was still too wide for me around the waist/bottom and had too much of a swingy effect - it made me look like i was pregnant so i sadly returned. i wish this had more of a fitted look to it."
3322	I am 5'5 about 110 lbs and the size 0 regular fits me well. sometimes i order petite, but the regular fit me just right. they are higher waisted than most pants i wear, but they are completely adorable and comfortable to boot. love the pattern. the sturdy quality is tangible. definitely going to order more of these pants in different patterns as they become available.
3323	This is classic retailer at it's best.  quality   style   a little something extra makes this piece something that will likely live in my fall / winter wardrobe for decades to come.  first the quality is superb, soft gray wool with a delicate floral embroidery motif on the front. military buttons down the front with a fit and flare waist on a 3/4 length coat.  versatile enough to wear as a sweater or light coat for early fall. fit is generous enough to easily fit a bulky sweater underneath and lay
3324	"I'm 5'10"" and felt that it was just too short. otherwise - love it!"
3325	"These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter, but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight, but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back!   for reference ( if you decide to try your luck), i am 5'7"", 128# and my normal size s was perfect."
3326	Love this sweater. i have it in both colors. it's lightweight - a nice late summer/early fall option. the sleeves are really long which i love. because it's a loose knit, it will snag somewhat easily, so be a little careful
3327	Beautifully made, designer sweater. and it's soft and comfortable. i decided to return because it's just too much for my body.  the fringe, which is quite long, overwhelmed my shape and i looked much larger than i am. the color is true white. the knit itself is fuzzy. it closes with a single button on the placket at the neckline. although not for me, i do recommend.
3328	I tried these on in in a 27/4 in the store and they were a bit snug. they graciously offered to look online and found the 28/6. they arrived in less than a week and are perfect. a note was enclosed saying they actually ran out of this size but another store was able to find them and ship...i love that retailer did not even call and worry me over it, they just fixed the problem. thank you!
3329	I'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are. i ordered the petite small, and i'm always a small. these are huge. i felt like i had on a large. i like the thin material and color, and i'm sad that they are so large.
3330	I normally get a small in this style shirt but it didn't fit at all so i had to send it back. too bad
3331	"Great dress in terms of material, quality, print...something about the weight with the lining made it not work for me. i ordered one size down as recommended by other reviewers, but that didn't work; there was too much fabric for the length and the lining made it look heavier. i ordered a medium and i""m 5'5"" on the curvy side. oh well. i've had so much luck with other retailer orders so i'm not too disappointed."
3332	"Lets discuss the neckline: it's fabulous! furthermore, this sweater can go anywhere, it's dress up, dress down.  feeling low? this girl will lift you up and take you to town."
3333	This is a great piece, it fits really well and the fabric is nice and soft. it is a good thickness so you don't have to wear a shirt underneath.
3334	I'm not much for ponchos, but this one looked unique. it is thin, kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online,, and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.
3335	This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin, and this style of top is usually quite flattering, but this one missed the mark big time.
3336	"I saw this online and said to myself, next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress. i am glad i did! i bought the neutral dress (off white,tan.black) because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions. i am 5'6"", 136 pounds, the small fit me perfect! in retailer dresses i am between a small/med. the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus. the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to"
3337	I love this! very comfortable & cute dress. true to size & picture. can't wait to wear it!
3338	Beautiful top for summer. love the yellow under the thin white fabric. the photo is good representation. running big.
3339	Great top but it runs smaller than other tops in this brand. the chest and arm area is small. otherwise this top is great. just plan to size up one or two sizes. length was nice. hit right at the waist.
3340	I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.
3341	This shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line. the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft. the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it. no spare buttons included, but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it. not big enough of an issue to return,
3342	"This is a beautiful sweater/tunic/dress. i ordered in the mustard color, and wearing it will brighten my day on a dreary winter morning. it is so hard to find winter clothes in bright colors. the sweater is soft and not itchy. it is a bit longer than i expected...maybe 35"" (i am 5'7""), but that is just fine! it can be worn with leggings or tights. dressed up or dressed down. i couldn't be more pleased."
3343	I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue, but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide, shapeless, and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite, i'm not sure it's worth the price, because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.
3344	"I automatically knocked off one star because every brand that offers size xs (and many also offer xxs), should also care about us size 14/16/xls as well. i ordered a size large, and of course it shows every bump and love handle in back, but i recreated a look from my local retailer's window. they showed a long unbuttoned cotton weave dress over this crochet dress. (the closest dress pictured online to what i saw is the ""mabli maxi dress"", but imagine it opened if it had buttons, and in blue.) with"
3345	The prints are subtle, the fabric is soft, and the mismatched buttons are cute. unfortunately, even in an xs, it was huge all over. i love flowy shirts and swing styles, but this just stuck way out from my body and was unflattering.
3346	The nolan's are my favorite pair of jeans from any brand. they are skinny leg but not too tight and the material is oh so soft. i buy 1-2 sizes down as they stretch out a lot.
3347	I love the unusual print, but the cut didn't work for me. i've got a round back side and a sway back, and the dress made me look twice as big front to back than i actually am because there's no shaping to help it adjust to the curves. so sad!
3348	Relaxed fit, soft and comfortable. interesting design but material is extremely thin. if i had purchased this at full price, i probably would have returned it. it seems more like a pajama top...
3349	I almost bought this skirt yesterday in store, but decided against it because the fabric was subpar. the skirt i tried on was snagged and unraveled. i selected another skirt, which i purchased. as the sales associate was folding the skirt, i noticed that this one was also snagged and unraveling. despite loving the style and fit, i had to be realistic with my lifestyle and decided to return it then and there. if there were two severe snags on two skirts before even leaving the store, how would th
3350	I love the crisscross detail that makes this a stylish and also flattering piece. lovely soft material that drapes well and hides imperfections. wish it came in more colors!
3351	I bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer. store, but, they didn&#39;t have my size.  someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up.  i probably would have bought the xs but, it was gone.  i went with it a little oversized and love it!  great quality and workmanship on the embroidery.   more like the items that retailer used to sell in 2004 and 2005!  super cute, love it!
3352	This looks sooooo much better on, than on the hanger/in the picture. i bought the grey, and it is the most comfortable tunic i've ever worn. it is light, airy, and so easy to wear. i wish it came in more prints/colors, cause i'd buy another one, in a skinny minute! if you don't try this on, you're missing out on a surprisingly awesome wardrobe piece. you can wear it year-round with jeans, pants, a vest, wrap, scarves, leggings, boots, sandals or anything else, and it looks chic and whimsical. go
3353	Very cozy lounge tee, but runs large. i ordered a small rather than my usual medium and could of probably went down two sizes.
3354	This is a charming dress, with lots of quality touches, and something which is easy to wear and appropriate for many occasions. however, the dress i received wasn't quite like the dress pictured in the catalog and main website photos. the bottom buttons of the over-dress do not have matching holes, so you can't button it. this makes the v lower, and the bodice looser. it is like the photo with the brunette model on the website, rather than the primary photos with the blonde lady. personally, i w
3355	I love this top! i just bought it on sale so the price was great but it would have been totally worth it paying full price! great quality, unique, and great fit. i look forward to wearing it all year!
3356	I was hesitant to get this piece but for the price i couldn't resist and i'm so glad i got it !! it is beautiful in person and can be worn so many  different ways.  it really makes you look slim too ! i got the size small and i am 5'4 and 130 lbs and it's a perfect fit !!
3357	Such a cute pattern, and i loved the fold-over design, but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms, and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband, but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent
3358	Because of how much i have been buying recently, i didn't *want* to like this dress. i just tried it on because it's such a classic dress. i'll probably wear it all year-round, dress it up or down, and it'll probably last for ages. so i tried it and it's cute. and flattering. and practical. and the scallop neckline in the back is just enough of a tease to be fun without being too obvious.

3359	Does not say ribbed. did not want ribbed. would not have bought ribbed
3360	Super flattering! stretch a little with repeated wear but not as much as other pairs. i love these!!!
3361	Adorable dress, amazing fit!
3362	Love this dress! perfect length and i love the construction and where the seams hit (not too long, not too short). i got so many compliments with this dress!
3363	I tried this on in store and since my usual size 6 wasn't available i tried on a 4. it was a little snug in the upper sleeves and shoulders but was lovely otherwise. i passed on it and waited for it to go on sale to order it online. i got it in my usual size 6 but it seemed to me like it was 2 sizes bigger than the 4. i have decided to keep it but i just wasn't thrilled with the fit.
3364	"I was so surprised to find this in the sale. it is beautiful. light and airy while lined. the color is bright and fun. it is so comfortable. i ordered an xs based on reviews (this is my typical size in this type of style) and it fit great. i ordered the regular length even though i am only 5'4"". i am about 120#. will be an easy ""go to"" skirt to throw on for a casual look or can be dressed up. did i mention comfortable?"
3365	This is a great little top. the tie sits right at the waist and loose enough to slide over top of pants or shorts. the detailing at neck and shoulders is very eye catching. i received several compliments when i wore it.
3366	I really love how comfortable and versatile this dress is. the midi length is perfect for booties or flats, and the cowl neck is loose and fluid, so it lays well. the only complaint i had, and it's minor, is the tulip skirt doesn't stay closed well when i walk or sit, which reveals more inner thigh than i am comfortable showing. i have to be very mindful of the skirt all day (i teach high school).
3367	This was my favorite piece in my order. it fit so well that i immediately went online to see if they had other colors. they don't. i voice the other reviewers opinion: get more colors in of this style. i would order in a heartbeat. i plan on wearing this to work (it's freezing in my office) but it is versatile enough to pair with jeans for a casual look. the material was soft, woven tightly (a good thing) and well made. good one retailer! definitely a keeper.
3368	Thank you to all of the reviewers who took the time to write a review. your reviews are what help me know exactly which size to order and how to know that i needed a regular instead of a petite. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a size 8 in retailer sizes. i went with a medium regular based on other reviews. thanks so much because the fit was perfect though still a little roomy.
3369	"Lovely dress ,comfortable fabric and great cut . the combination of the alignment of stripes works beautifully and is very figure flattering. versatile to keep casual or dress up with a great pair of shoes."
3370	"This skirt fits great. the thick material helps it lay nicely and smooth the curves. i'm 5-4"" about 130lbs, athletic build with a bottom and the med fit well."
3371	It's a rather boring tank. i thought it'd be perfect under a cardigan for work, but decided against it. the fit is boxy, and does not look good on a girl with curves.
3372	I saw this online yesterday and i was in the store today to try it on. i assumed it would look average or below average on me and i could just walk away no problem. by no means am i in the financial bracket to be spending this much money on a jumpsuit, yet here i am at home wearing it as i write this review. it is surprisingly flattering. i am 5 feet tall and have a petite frame so wide leg pants never work on me, but this somehow did without making me look bulky. given my height, it comes to ab
3373	This dress is beautiful, it just swallowed my small frame whole! the colors and design are gorgeous, just not a good fit for me, even at a 0p.
3374	"I got this top in navy and i love it. it's loose and flowy and comfortable, yet dressy enough to wear for work (or dress down with jeans). i'm 5'4"", 125lbs and the 6 was a bit large on me. i could've sized down a little but i actually liked the loose fit, and the length was long enough to tuck in if i wanted to. definitely recommend."
3375	Pretty, easy-to-wear dress. loose fitting. i am typically a size 4, size 4 fit, but i might have been able to go to a size 2 if i wanted it to be more fitted at the chest/arms.
3376	I remember seeing this great jackets online and knowing that i would have to have it! so i traveled to the store to try it on. the ruffle on the bottom was beautiful and fluffy and just like the pictures. the color was perfect and it was lightweight enough i could get more uses out of it that most of my coats in the texas heat. so i tried on the small. the didn't quite button over my bust, and i did an arm wiggle that made the arms too tight near where they met my body. no problem, medium it is.
3377	Great shirt. i couldn't picture the material but it's washable and great for hot days when you want to look styling.
3378	I like having lightweight summer pajamas, and these are perfect. the print is so much cuter in person and the fabric is wonderfully silky. the pants themselves seemed to run a little bit small. i ordered them in xs and s and ended up keeping the small. overall a great purchase.
3379	I love the look of this garment. from the color to the detailed design, it is just awesome looking. i tried this in 3 sizes: 2regular, 2petite, and 0 regular. i often order petite pants and they work, but for this item the crotch was too high for me to wear a petite size, and the legs were short enough to look awkward. i returned it for the 0 regular which fit me best - i'm 5'5, 110 lbs. i haven't worn it out yet, but am excited to wear it to a couple weddings this season. one fallback is that i
3380	Cute colored jeans.  ordered the sky color & when it arrived,  the color was a medium moss green color.  the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them.
3381	I didn't think i'd like this due to the high neck, but i was in the store and it was so soft that i tried it on in the black motif. this dress is so comfortable and flattering. it's definitely a versatile piece: dress down with a denim jacket or dress up with heels. and it has pockets!
3382	Very pretty dress, perfect style for my build, bigger busted, muffin top. the material/pattern is really pretty.
3383	"I tried on this dress in the store and was pleasantly surprised with the fit and the look. it looks way better in person than in the pictures. the picture really doesn't do it justice. i consider myself a ""slight"" hour glass figured girl and this dress at the top hit me just right so that the crosswrap looks like it was made for my body and the peephole/keyhole in the front (you can hardly see on the model photo) is visible. i'm so happy with this dress!!! i feel like i could wear it at work/chu"
3384	I read the mixed reviews on this tee but i think the fit is flattering and comfortable. i sized down as i do in many retailer tops and it is fitted in the shoulder and chest and then widens away at the waist. the length hits me at the hip--i have worn it layered with a longer tank underneath.
3385	Every byron lars dress that i have is definitely beyond ordinary and this one is no exception. i love the petals that adorn the front.  my dress was back ordered for a couple of months but it was well worth the wait. i wore it recently and received compliments galore. if you're undecided about this one, go for it!!!  it's a winner.
3386	I definitely recommend this shirt. it's lights and airy, something you can wear everyday.
3387	"There wasn't much question as to whether or not i'd love these pants, as i have several pairs of the pilcro ""hyphen"" pant; however, this one is slightly different (front pocket's and seam down front), and though they are slightly different, the fit and cut are the same. these pants are a great weight--can wear year round, really--but these will be my ""go to"" pants this fall and winter. the length is nice--can wear with shoes or rolled up with boots, too--""utility"" chinos? yes!  the fit is nicely"
3388	What a great, easy to wear jumpsuit! i love that the sleeves are a relaxed fit...sometimes they make these jumpsuits so unforgiving who wants to wrangle your way in and out? anyway i totally agree with the other reviewers that this is very stylish, comfortable and it looks amazing on.
3389	"These pants have substance in the material, it seems thick. i found htem to be very comfortable and love the tir waist detail. my only ""complaint' is they don't come in petites, so on my short legs, teh hem came jsut above my ankle. i think htey would look nicer with a tighter shirt than pictured on the model. did not purchase,but keeping in mind for future..."
3390	I saw these in an email and immediately went to the web to look at them. they fit well and have nice slim look. the bottom of the legs seems to fit a little slimmer on me than in the picture, but they aren't too tight.
3391	I love this tee!!! i bought the red, and it is just so cute. the background is a light pink - and there are accents of deeper rose and mint green. i also bought the angel of the north cascade cardigan in rose, which looks great over this tee. buy it!
3392	I am in love with this sweater. i am 5'4 and wear a size 8 and bought a large. perfect length and fit. will wear with jeans or leggings. the quality was amazing and i can't wait to wear it!
3393	This print is beautiful and the design is unique and great for work. my only complaint is that it runs huge and the torso fit is extremely boxy. i'm normally in between a size xs and s at retailer, bought the xs in this shirt and it still almost too big.
3394	I put this runs small but it's a little more tts, except the arms are very slim! if you like to push your sleeves up like this model, you will have to wait for a while to see if the sweater loosens up. length wise it fit me a bit longer than this model and i'm a petite. the color is also darker and not as red as in this sweaters, which i actually prefer. the sweater is much thicker than my other cashmere sweaters. some of the stitching seems stick out as if the sweater is worn inside out, but th
3395	The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
3396	Great green color. drapes well. nice gray detailing adds dimension to an already pretty sweater.
3397	Purchased these in the blue motif. love the hei hei brand. . they run true to size. they are very comfortable and wear well. you can wear them to the office,dress them up or go casual with a tee. versatility and comfort, what more could you ask for.
3398	I bought this top on sale - very glad i did not pay full price for it! i wash everything before i wear it. when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm - i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot, but the hole will be a little trickier, as the material is kind of filmy.
3399	Dress fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable. great for day or evening. love it!,
3400	This blouse is so pretty! i love the neck tie which gives it interest and won't look boring on it's own. i'll wear this all-year round. i ordered an xxs which fits perfect.
3401	I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.
3402	"Soft and flowy. fit is great. quality is great. i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well. i haven't worn a dress in 10+ years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first. highly recommend. i paired this with 4"" short black suede boots and black tights. many compliments (even from my husband and he doesn't usually pay much attention)."
3403	I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.
3404	I'm always an xl in retailer blouses, and to be quite honest sometimes the xl are too tight to keep. however, in this blouse the size medium fits me like a normal size xl would, meaning i had to go down 2 sizes. even at size medium the blouse is still very loose and flowy. the body is cut like a trapeze a-line, so very forgiving. the fabric has a lot of stretch to it, so the arms aren't tight. the fabric is very comfortable and the lace detail is nice. just a heads up for anyone who would c
3405	I'm a power-walker. i bought this tank in 3 colors and rotate through them. they're great for working out with a nice sports bra underneath. i also wear them with leggings. so cute! love the colors, the fit. yes, they're thin. i don't think they'll last for years and years, but with the sale price they are such a great deal.
3406	Great skirt, easy to wear. perfect weight for spring/fall. very comfortable while still looking stylish. the xs fit well.
3407	I wear this vest two ways - over a long sleeve shirt when it's warmer and layered over a shirt and cardigan when it's cooler. it's the perfect amount of warmth when i'm running errands and don't want to wear a heavy coat. love it and plan to wear it a lot!
3408	I thought this dress was beautiful, but i felt it was a little young for me. i am 55 and was looking for something to wear to my niece's wedding. if i had been the mother of the bride, i would have kept it, but....
3409	I wear an xxs petite and this dress was still large. i like that look so i'm okay with that but the sides do stick out a little bit if you have a smaller frame.
3410	I love this skirt! i know others have thought it frumpy, maybe it's because i'm so long waisted but this skirt is perfect for me! not too long not too short but just right! the fabric print is beautiful a mix of muted and bright colors. the fabric quality is nice but nothing overly outstanding. still i'm glad i ordered it before it was gone!
3411	I have these in grey and i love them! they are so comfy. i got them in m/l even though i am a s/m because i like the loose fit. they are very soft.
3412	This color is really cool because it can go with black, grey, or tan shoes. the back pleats are unique and do not add bulk. the back is also lined, so you don't need a tank. fits tts and i thought it was fairly flattering. on sale, this is a great deal.
3413	This has such a beautiful shape, goes with so many things and has gotten a lot of compliments already. my favorite new piece.
3414	"This is one of those ""very retailer"" tops that you can't find anywhere else. the feel is ""folkloric"", but the country is not specific. although listed as a ""tee"", the material is a knit with heft and is lined (from the bust seam down). the embroidery is combined with cut-work to give it a high-end finish (and justify the price). this is a dress-up tee for sure. i will most likely treat it as a blouse and wear it with cropped black culottes or a slim midi skirt. i wear either a 0 or 2 in mos"
3415	Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.
3416	It's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i can't wait for cooler weather. i tried it on with skinny jeans and it's darling. love how it's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum. perfect for leggings. nice slim, but not tight fit.
3417	Very warm and snuggly, gorgeous color, nice fit. i have a little trouble getting the neck to lay right, but managed so it works for work. i can't say enough how toasty it is. very good quality and styling.
3418	"My review is of the ""black motif"" (no longer listed online, but i saw a bunch in the clearance sock bin at the georgetown dc store, today, 12/27/2015).  i love beautiful and unique socks! so i thought i'd give these a chance. i like them so much that i bought 3 more pairs of the exact same sock now that they're on sale!  two things i noticed... the way the sock is knit, when you put it on, it no longer has a matte black look in the black areas. it is sort of a stretched, slightly two-tone look."
3419	I love this piece !   i purchased it on sale months ago and when  i wear it i just love it!!  it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect it's very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing  i'm very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine  would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices   thx retailer!
3420	This is a cute dress, but it runs very large through. if i had decided to keep it, i would have taken it to my seamstress to remove some of the volume. when i ordered, i assumed it was red and black checked, but it is navy. my black cropped leather jacket and boots won't work with those colors, so it is going back.
3421	"I am between a xs and s but figured i would order down based on the reviews. well, it's still huge. i have about 5 inches that i can take in from the side. i have ordered the xxs and am hoping it will look more flattering. i love the colors and design, but as it is it does not do anything for me. for reference i am 124 lbs, 32d, 5'5""."
3422	"This shirt is stunning- definitely a shirt for special occasions. it's more than i would normally pay for a top, but it is a really special piece of clothing. the fit is slim- i'm 5'6"" and 118 pounds. i typically wear an xxs or xs in retailer clothes. the xxs is just right. it is quite sheer, so i imagine i will wear a nude tank top underneath."
3423	Received this shirt yesterday and loved it. doesn't look that great online in pics, but it is a unique and beautiful top. the material is a substantial woven cotton so it lays nicely and keeps its shape . i am 5'5 and 128lbs and a small bust size 34a , i usually wear small in shirts but since it is a longer length i didn't want it to tight around my butt.... i am curvy in that area size 6 pants....i ordered the medium and i am so glad i did .. it lifts just like on the model...the only downfall
3424	I love this shirt so much i bought it in another color. it looks like it does in the picture, loose and flowy.
3425	"I?m not the type of woman that wears dresses, but oh man...this dress! i?ve been eyeing it for a while, and it finally went on sale, then the extra 30% off made me cave. got it for $115. i bought it one size smaller (8) to encourage me to not over-indulge this xmas, and if fit like a glove. for reference, i?m 36 bust, 30 waist and normally a size 10 in retailer. it accentuates your curves & hugs your body while being ""sexy/conservative"". the intricate embroidery is exquisite and very eye catching."
3426	This dress pops! gorgeous colors and simple, classic flowy design. i thought it ran a little big, i ended up with xs for best overall fit in chest and a more streamline flow. 34b for reference.
3427	Super comfy, easy to put on, and super cute! you can dress it up and dress it down! i'm usually a size s and the small fits fine, but i think the xs would have fit better.
3428	This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned, there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black, the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains, rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur
3429	I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with. my recent preference has been for high-rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash. when i tried these on in my normal size, they were so cute that i bought them full-priced. i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy (which is what makes them soft and comfortable), but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours. by th
3430	Purchased this in two colors online. purchased in an xs - i am usually a s or xs. the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering. returning both.
3431	Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don't know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain, not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn't even the same material as the front. it's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand, this was just a quality control oversight i guess.
3432	This is a great top and it fit me very nicely but it's much longer than it appear to be in the picture. i'm 5'2 and it was more like a tunic than a tank on me. if it were shorter it would be one of my favorite staples i'm sure. if you're very tall i think you will love it.
3433	This dress is really beautiful and high quality. the pattern, color, and fabric are great. the fit is flattering (i'm hourglass to pear shaped) and the size perfect for me in petite. please keep offering high quality clothes in petite sizes by higher end designers.
3434	Noticed all the 5 star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets- so due to the past 2 years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans....i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula- thick denim, just the right amount of give and a flattering 10 inch rise. walked right in and found them- and i knew right when i touched them- they were still the thin denim that's nowhere near the quality they once were. consumers pay attention and t
3435	"This is the most perfect dress i've ever bought. i'm 5'8"" and the length was perfect. the cut is flattering and very slimming. the fabric is gorgeous and the pattern is stunning. please offer more dresses in this cut!!"
3436	It is polyester but seems good quality. looks like a girls nightgown with the pattern combined with the baby doll dress silhouette and the overall width of the dress. i usually wear a small but, to look like it does on the model, 6-8 inches would have to go in the width.
3437	"I love this shirt! it's gorgeous! got it last night, wore it today, and received compliments all day long.  i don't normally look good in tunic length tops, but somehow there's magic in this one. the seaming on the front totally hides my post-baby pooch. too bad the baby just turned 3 and my pooch isn't going anywhere ...!  adore."
3438	"This dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice. it does have an a-line fit in the skirt. the stitching is beautiful. honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me. some may like that, but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted. the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress. the fabric is cotton and it is not lined. i am 5'9"" and it does hit right about where it does on the model. i am sending it back, because i didn't say ""wow, i love this"" w"
3439	"Spotted this in the local store last week & just had to try it on! it is a soft cotton gauze texture which is slightly stiff but in a good way. my usual size small was too big. the oversized look was fine from front & back view, but in the side view the bottom stuck way out. the xs was much better so i took it home. its very comfy & looks great with dark blue denim. 5'3"", 118#."
3440	This is beautiful on. it flatters the figure nicely. the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin. it is very low cut but it looks wonderful.
3441	The blouse is absolutely beautiful. i am 5' and the length is perfect. even though it fit a little snug across the chest, it's a keeper. i'll wear it open on the top with a nice cami underneath.
3442	This jacket is the best! definitely my staple jacket for the spring. it is so comfortable and soft. i usually wear a small in retailer clothing, but i opted for the medium in this so there's a little room for layering. even with the extra room, it is so flattering. i absolutely love this jacket!
3443	Thank you retailer for a collection that includes dressy mid-length dresses suitable for special occasions! the simplistic beauty, quality of workmanship, and form fitting style of this dress is perfect. the fit and flare enhances curves and hides flaws. it pairs perfectly with the necklace shown and a cropped lace front cardigan that i found elsewhere. admittedly, i am not sure that younger clients would be happy with the tea length, but i am ecstatic!
3444	I love this top!!! i usually wear a medium but all that was left were larges, so i figured i'd take a chance. it is gorgeous, and not too big! the quality is fabulous, and the color is very soft and complimentary. i am so glad i ordered this. can't wait to wear it!!!
3445	I do not have an retailer where i live so i ordered this tunic online. the material is extremely soft & comfortable ( not at all itchy). tts. i fell in love with it immediately and can't believe how many compliments i received all day long when i wore it to work ( with some skinny ankle length pants). can be dressed up or down. this is certainly going to get a lot of use this fall
3446	This coat is wonderful! i am usually an xs-s in retailer and i got the xs. it is supposed to be a bit large. goes with everything and great quality.
3447	Nice quality fabric and design, but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
3448	This is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk. i received many compliments when i wore this, with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry. the fit is true to size, i took my usual size l. it is longer on me than the model, and my only complaint is the slip-it is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together, so i had to find a different slip. i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer, i don't
3449	I so badly wanted this dress to work for me. the material and color is so beautiful. this had a 'sack like' fit and the side pockets accentuated my hips giving me a broader look than i would like.
3450	Just received this dress in the mail. it's stunning!! the lace is just beautiful. i ordered two sizes and had to size down a bit - the fit is generous. can't wait to wear this to my rehearsal dinner next week.
3451	"I originally bought the white lace version of this dress, but it felt too ""bridey?"" then i snagged all three of the velvet blazers and spotted this black version. i like that it is not all lace, with the pleated chiffon ""center."" the under slip is straight and fits with the outer layer sheer enough to give the appearance of there being a shape under the flow. it is so versatile as i can do it with the velvet blazers and booties or classic lbd with black pumps. well worth the price as this will f"
3452	This is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person - a nice mix of modern and artistic, with just enough color and a flattering fit. my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day, especially at the neckline. if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin, i would recommend it for style and fit.
3453	"It's always sunny when i wear this sunshine yellow tee.  love the color and they way it was pieced together.  has a flattering feminine fit whole still feeling relaxed and casual.  it's slightly sheer but not obscene.  all linen and a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i purchased medium and i'm 39/28/35 140# 5'3"""
3454	"Very cute adorable shape tank top but extremely huge   does not come in petite and is not even close to fitting me   extra small is like a medium   not a sky color , like the picture it is a black-and-white type of the shirt which needs a thin camisole underneath  shirt is definitely white but would look great with the black or gray camisole underneath   better for taller larger sized people"
3455	The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.
3456	I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!
3457	Great tank! i really like the black and white striped one! very versatile .
3458	Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
3459	This over-sized sweater is light-weight and scratchy. i knew it would fit big, but the neck is overly bulky. the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture. fits a little larger (on me) than on the model. i'm petite so it overwhelmed me.
3460	"Oh wow no. as the previous reviewer said, much lighter than the picture! rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe? the fit is true to size, i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum (waist 28/29, hips 36, usually a 27 or 28 in jeans, sometimes even a 29 if they're super skinny)."
3461	I loved these shorts; however, they seemed to be doomed! i received these on july 2nd & wore them at for a party we had on july 3rd, with the top shown. the fit was true to size, style & quality were nice. during the day i first ripped them on a low arbor gate latch, then later they were splashed with red wine when my husband startled me & i threw my red wine in the air. typically, i am very careful and do no have an issue with ruining my clothes. he felt so bad he asked me to get a new pair. i
3462	"This dress is even more gorgeous in person! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store. i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years. i think i have finally found ""the one'! i should note i am 5'9"" and this dress goes all the way to my knees. it may swallow someone on the shorter side."
3463	"I saw these shorts while leaving the store and immediately went back to the register to add them to my wardrobe. they fit me true to other cartionnier clothing. i'm 5'7"" 126 lbs and took a size 6. there is a significant amount of stretch in them, but do not grow as the day goes on. the colors are bright and fun without looking juvenile."
3464	I am so glad i did not miss out on these jeans. i am new to pilcro and am finding they fit me so well!
3465	I tried this on in the store and thought the flowy fit and asymmetrical hem were great. the fabric is thin, which is nice for summer, but lined at the top half so it's not transparent except below the knee. the waist is quite high and has flexible elastic for an easy fit. i liked the skirt a lot and came online to find it in petite. sadly, it is sold out of most sizes in the petite length. i wish antrho would order more of the petite sizes because they seem to sell out fast!
3466	Tried this on in the store and fell in love. it's such a simple shirt but the details are special. runs tts. will get a lot of use out of this.
3467	Super easy and cute. i received lots of compliments!
3468	I love this tank. i got it in the turquoise and just ordered the blue. this tank is indeed linen and does not wrinkle. it's fitted without being too tight. i have a somewhat shorter torso and narrow waist and athletic build and this looks great! i'm not a fan of flowy tops in general so thrilled to find this easy, casual piece. i ordered an xs but am usually either xs or s in retailer.
3469	"These socks feel amazing-i have them in both colors.  you would be surprised at the softness of these socks, yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks. i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me. i feel like these would last a long time, with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spa-these socks are soft?  these socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li"
3470	"Love this dress! i agree with some of the other reviewers, the arm holes are a little low but not a deal breaker. i'm 5'8"" 120lbs. and ordered the xs and it fits perfect. would definitely recommend!"
3471	This color is gorgeous. this could be dressed up or down. great buy!
3472	"The cotton, the print, and the online presentation of this dress are beautiful, i ordered right away! but there are some discrepancies. the shoulders have a ""puff"" to them that i don't notice on the model, and that doesn't flatter athletic shoulders. the buttons are (cheap) difficult to button. the waist sits much lower on the model than it must on anyone else, it's nearly empire on me. and, there is a lot more volume in the skirt of the dress than is shown in any photo. because the dress is tig"
3473	I purchased this on sale, xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater, but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy, but i would say itchy and cozy!
3474	Cute staple in classic style overall.  fabric weight is good, will be able to get by with nude bra.  many wardrobe options with this staple.
3475	But the back of it, by the waist, bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger, it will be too long. but i love the skirt, it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured, just below the knee in front. the waist is snug, bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier. (115 lbs, 26-27 in waist, short legs...)
3476	This dress is as stunning in person as it is in these pictures! i'm petite, and so it's longer on me than it is on the model. i got a 4p and the waist was perfect! i thought it might look matronly as it was longer, but it looks classic. i feel like i could dress it down just a bit with flats and a cardi, or wear it to an event with heals and a wrap. it's so comfortable and forgiving in the waist and belly area, which is icing on the cake! i had absolutely no reason to buy it, but once i tried it
3477	Very comfortable to wear. you can wear it any season.  it runs true to size.  nice fabric.  it&amp;#39;s a simple black dress.  love it!
3478	I love this top. lovely, light, airy material, though i don't think i'll wear a cami under it. i'm usually a small petite so i ordered this in an extra small. i love the way it fits.
3479	Gorgeous dress, colors as appear in picture, thick material- quality is good. sizing- im usually a size 2 or small, got a small, and it is big in the chest/ length is below the knee. would recommend a size smaller than normal. not a huge deal- small alteration job.
3480	This is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way. this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i can't wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots. it's not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well. love it.
3481	Love, love, love this dress. it is very slimming. it hugs you without really touching you. leaving the tie and a few buttons open gives it more of a casual feel.
3482	Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.
3483	"This skirt looks very nice in person and it hugs one's cure beautifully. the hem is uneven which makes it more interesting. i am 5'2"", 120lbs, tried it in the navy/beige color in size s and size xs, and i found size xs fits better. the fabric is soft and stretchy, and it drapes well. because i am petite, the length of the normal size fits me more like a maxi skirt (it goes all the way down to my mid calf). unfortunately, the petite xs is sold out, so i have to settle with the normal size xs. sti"
3484	"I am on the fence about this dress, as you'll see the reasons below, but it is really breathable fabric and extremely comfortable! _________ pros: - tons of stretch to the top part. i'm a 36c, so a lot of retailer tops are too snug for women with some bust. however, i fit into a medium here without it being too snug. you could actually go down or up depending on how loose or tight you'd like it to be on you. - the bottom half, the skirt, feels so nice on the skin. very breezy. it is layered an"
