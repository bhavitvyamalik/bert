2500	1	a	"I love the fabric and pattern of this dress so much that i decided to keep it (got it on mega sale), but i would have never paid full price or anything close. the armholes are enormous, showing bra and all. i am not particularly large chested (34c), and the buttons are stretched to gaping on me, even with the huge armholes. i have a cute red sweater coat that i will wear over it all fall, but i could not recommend it because of the poor cut design.  pros: great pattern, fabric, pockets, true to"
2501	2	a	"I understand what the previous reviewer meant when she says these are great for around the house. the yarn is thick but the weave is open so they are nicely springy but not very warm.  they look perfect with my birkenstocks so i'm getting then in all colors."
2502	1	a	Cute dress that is perfect for a casual summer wedding or brunch with friends. i love the material and that the dress is lined. it is very comfortable and it has pockets. this is definitely more of a ?golden? yellow vs. a soft yellow. my only complaint is that i wish it were cinched more right below the bust. it would give the dress (and me) more shape. i would say this dress is true to size but if you have a larger chest, you will likely want to size up. if you have a small chest, i would proba
2503	1	a	Not sure who named this dress, but it isn't a swing dress. it's a beautiful dress out of very soft fabric, with elegant embroidery design and pretty fringe detail. and pockets! i've worn this dress with tennis shoes, leather flip flops, and heels and been complimented each time. love this dress!
2504	4	a	Love this tee. it has a drapery cut which i love. the only thing i found was that it ran a bit smaller.
2505	0	a	I'm normally a size 25p. i bought these in a 26 because i wanted a more relaxed fit. i could barely pull them up over my calves. i could get them on and button them, but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw. size up 2 sizes at least!
2506	4	a	Love this crinkle cotton top for spring. the print is great and i can't wait to wear it!
2507	4	a	"This top makes you feel like you should be in the tropics sipping a frosty cocktail. fabric is soft, not too sheer. i'm usually an xs and that's what i kept in this top. armholes not too low as in some. for reference, 5'4"", 123 lbs"
2508	0	a	"Around 5 years ago, i bought 4 pairs of ""daughters of the liberation"" brand (very similar style) shorts at retailer, and have been repairing any and all frayed fabric in the first two pair, in a lighter material than the second two pair, ever since, in order to preserve my #1 favorite shorts. thank goodness pilcro - another longtime fave brand of pants available at retailer - came through this year with these very similar, but perhaps even nicer, shorts. i bought the yellow striped pai"
2509	4	a	
2510	0	a	I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice, but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.
2511	4	a	"I originally bought this in a petite xs. i am 5' 4"" tall on a good day. sometimes longer sweaters can overwhelm me. but the petite was almost a bit snug and short in the arms. i exchanged it for a regular xs and while i now have to cuff the sleeves, the overall look is much better. i bought the gray but really liked the blue and moss too. will be very nice for the frigid days we have in ohio. looks great with leggings tucked into boots i think. a winner!"
2512	2	a	$78 for a pair of sweats seems like a lot of money, but not when you consider the amount of wear you will get out of these pants. they are thin and a little on the long side, but very flattering. plus, the thin material makes them perfect for summer nights. i love the pockets. not a big fan of the tie on the front, but that's just a personal preference. i won't just be wearing these on the weekend. i found lots of fun tops and jackets in my closet that will turn these pants into something i'll b
2513	5	a	The dress is pretty, i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran, i took both back the neck is too tight!
2514	0	a	"I really love this pair of fitted cargos. i'm 5""1, 103 pounds and bought a 25p since that what i take in most jeans at retailer. it is quite fitted like it shows on the model so some may prefer to size down for a comfortable fit. i bought the grey color and is a lovely neutral color. love these and may have to go for another color!"
2515	0	a	So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews, they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly, too. there are weird fading marks all over, even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely
2516	1	a	I saw this dress in the store window and gave it a try. i found it to be super flattering and feminine. the bodice is form fitting and the skirt flares out to a full skirt. the colors are fun and vibrant. the neckline is a bit low for work but perfect for evening. it is true to size.
2517	4	a	Great addition to my cold weather wardrobe! comfortable and has the slouchy look, but still nice enough to wear to work.
2518	4	a	The pattern and color of this top are beautiful. when i saw the pattern, i knew i had to have it. the fit is a bit strange, short (which is fine for me as i am petite) and boxy. i bought it on sale and think its good value for the price. its a good late summer/early fall piece.
2519	4	a	"At last, in a world of loose, billowy silhouettes, a draped top that falls a little closer to the body! the fabric is of good weight and has the right amount of stretch.  i also love the retro/vintage pattern of the fabric itself. the fit is feminine and comfortable.  you will have to wear a camisole with this top, but i do not consider that a negative. it is the way of the deep v neck."
2520	1	a	"This is a very cute dress! the sweater material is not itchy at all. i love the bell sleeve and how the seam at the top of the bell matches up to the waistline of the dress. good quality and well made. i am 5' 9"" tall and this dress falls just above my knees. so for me, it's the perfect length. i bought the black dress and i look forward to wearing it throughout the fall and winter."
2521	0	a	I love the beautiful flowy material and design. definitely runs a bit large. i ordered an xs and it needs to be taken in as well as taken up. i would have ordered the petite if it wasn't out of stock, so the length is probably fine for most. shimmery detail is beautiful.
2522	4	a	I eyed this for so long hoping it would go on sale. i finally bought it during the 20% off retailer members day. sized up from my usual size 4 to avoid the buttons on the bust looking like they were about to burst free. the rest still fits way. i absolutely cannot wait for the next rainy day to wear this!
2523	4	a	This sweatshirt is extremely comfy and stylish. i am happy with the item and it runs a snag large but perfect for a sweatshirt.
2524	4	a	I've been waiting for this to go on sale, and just picked one up in store. the details and style of this blouse do not disappoint! since it's billowy in nature, a size smaller fits me perfectly.
2525	1	a	"This is the reason i doggedly fight for items at retailer as there are often maybe 6 made in my xxsp.  you really have to see this in person. even the slip could be worn as a chemise alone with the double layer and dots. the colors are gorgeous. i wanted this to try with my burgundy velvet blazer (and it works withe the copper color - too).   the dress is really a swing shape - not close fitting - no ""waistline"" so it is very comfortable. the sleeves are fitted, but stretchy so should not be a"
2526	0	a	It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer. as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailer's pants are cut for slim figured women, this rare pair of pants crosses the divide, flattering both shapes. i usually have to look for xls. here, i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l. these pants are great. they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections. they will be my go to summer pant. i love them.
2527	5	a	This dress runs so large, why did they not make an extra small. the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering. i wish wish that they made this in the extra small, i was swimming in it, there was no way to fix it so it went back
2528	1	a	"I purchased the dress on a promotion.  the dress i received had the sleeves end about the elbow.  i added a 4"" black cotton lace to the sleeves.  i love the result.  it makes the design richer and brings out the lace running down the front of the dress.  the sleeves are a much better length for me now.  dress runs tts.  i purchased a medium, am 5'7"", 150 lbs, really am large boned, straight up and down."
2529	4	a	"This fits me more like a tunic so i wear it with jeggings. i am 5'4 and usually a 10-12 petite and the s fit well. the arms are stretchy which i like since i have an athletic build. love the butterfly pattern !"
2530	1	a	Beautiful dress, but works best with a belt where the dress cinches at the high waist. it runs huge: i'm 5'6 and a m/l but the small petite is what looks and fits the best. there is a lot of unnecessary fabric and stretch at the waist. i received a lot of compliments on this dress! glad i kept trying on smaller sizes.
2531	0	a	Bought these and they fit really well and are super comfy. love the color. will probably live in them this summer!
2532	4	a	I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d, and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny, the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer
2533	4	a	I found this to fit tts. i sometimes wear petite, but found the petite sizing to be a little off. i have a pretty short torso, but found the petite to be too short. i opted for the regular sizing and got a 6; it fits great. this top is great for work (styled with a cardigan or blazer) or for play. i can see it dressing up or down very easily.
2534	1	a	"It's not often you can find a dress that is warm, cozy, timeless, and sexy at the same time, but this one is it. the material is thick but clings to the body in all the right places. i normally wear an xs or s, and in this i took an xs. sleeves are nice and long. your shoulders are exposed as much as you want them to be, depending on how low you fold over the collar piece. i chose to tack mine down in place, so i'm not always adjusting it.  i wore this dress with black heeled over-the-knee boots"
2535	0	a	I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with. my recent preference has been for high-rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash. when i tried these on in my normal size, they were so cute that i bought them full-priced. i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy (which is what makes them soft and comfortable), but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours. by th
2536	1	a	"I am 5'-7"" and 135 lbs, i bought a medium petite as i wanted the dress to hit at my knees, instead of midi. this dress is easily 2 sizes bigger than expected. the pattern was not flattering on my although i'm sure it would be for others. i was happy with the length..."
2537	4	a	This was my favorite piece in my order. it fit so well that i immediately went online to see if they had other colors. they don't. i voice the other reviewers opinion: get more colors in of this style. i would order in a heartbeat. i plan on wearing this to work (it's freezing in my office) but it is versatile enough to pair with jeans for a casual look. the material was soft, woven tightly (a good thing) and well made. good one retailer! definitely a keeper.
2538	4	a	Love this top so much that i bought it in both colors. the fabric is wonderful and the pleated front is a nice feature. i also like the fabric covered buttons. you can button this top all the way or leave the top few buttons undone. either way, it looks cute. i especially like that it looks great under a blazer or cardigan and will look good uncovered when the weather heats up. great quality and features for the price.
2539	3	a	I tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it. the picture does not do it justice. it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality. fabric is very soft and light weight. highly recommend!
2540	0	a	"I don'tr even know why they btohered making a tall size for this, i would need a 6-7 inch heel for the petite version, which means regualr sized people should get petite. also, bigger, as in loose, i tried 0 and 2 and both ewre biggish (thopugh i could honestly not tell the difference). sales person told me to try 00, so we shall see... i will need to hem them if i kleep them though.  bronze color is very nice, so is balck, i ordered both for comparison.  lastly, cut is very flattering,especiall"
2541	1	a	Really liked this dress, but it ran too big for me.
2542	4	a	
2543	4	a	This blouse is very unique due to the pretty piped design on the back. looks great with jeans. the front is shorter and more tailored than the back. i love this blouse!
2544	4	a	I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment, it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.
2545	3	a	Love the fabric. comfortable to wear with jeans or a dress. good for those cool fall mornings.
2546	1	a	I couldn't get this to work for me. tried a variety of sizes and just couldn't get it to flow right. didn't purchase.
2547	2	a	
2548	1	a	I saw a review from another petite person who said this runs small, but i'm my case it ran true to size. it's a very flattering dress and easy to wear for any occasion.
2549	4	a	When i received this blouse, ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however, after hanging on my closet door, the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.
2550	4	a	This top runs large. i am usually a medium in retailer but when i read the first review, i ordered a small, and it was the right decision. i also agree that this top might be short for someone with long torso. love the back detail and the print and color is really nice!
2551	1	a	Saw this online- my size out (xs/s p). online did have xs. checked store saw how great the dress looked at store, able to try on only one avail at store (m). ordered xs online. fits well with ada belt and cardigan. until straps altered will keep cardigan on.very comfortable and cute- lots of compliments worn to work
2552	1	a	The fabric feels and hangs nicely. it's very versatile, you can dress up or down. i purchased the navy stripe one and wear with brown boots. thinking i might need one of the other two as well, perfect for texas winters!!
2553	4	a	I love this sweater, so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color, it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party.  i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.
2554	0	a	"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 143 lbs, and 38-32-40 and my normal size 10s fit me perfectly."
2555	4	a	I am usually a medium/large and was pleased to fit in the small/medium that i ordered after reading some of the reviews. lovely piece, great to wear over a short sleeve t-shirt, 3/4 of a sleeve shirt or even a long sleeve shirt when weather permits here in florida. very happy i ordered this!!
2556	1	a	Dress fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable. great for day or evening. love it!,
2557	1	a	"Surprisingly versatile and figure flattering without being too clingy and revealing like so many ""bandage"" dresses. the navy color softens the stripes. great piece for travel as it is light and does not wrinkle. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. with a smaller chest and curvy hips. the small fits perfectly."
2558	4	a	This blouse drapes nicely. the 8 in the store was too big which is not what i usually find with maeve. i wear a 6 or small in most blouses. i ordered the 6 and it was still too big, so i hope the 4 will work.
2559	0	a	Just purchased these online and couldn't wait to try them on! they are soft, comfortable and my new favorite pair of jeans! i love them! i am 5'8 and sz. 29...the color and quality are above my expectations :)
2560	0	a	The most important thing to note about this skirt is that it is a true blue color- not black! it's also perfect for spring , summer and early fall. super comfy, casual yet elegant. size runs a tiny bit small as the waist is not elasticized. a staple of a cozy chic wardrobe.
2561	4	a	The print is awesome !
2562	2	a	The pictures are not showing how absolutely spectacular this caftan is. it is very delicate (even says so on the tag) and lightweight so that you won't dread wearing it in the heat of the day. by what doesn't show up is that this caftan shimmers-there is gold string woven throughout the entire garment which gives it a slight sheen. it adds significantly to the impact of the garment, and i love this detail. i love the way this caftan drapes, and i love that it is longer than a normal caftan. the
2563	2	a	Looks really nice on teh pictures. i tried on thre cream as this was the only color availalbe at my store (tried on per stylist recommendation(. it is very thin, you can see ripples from my belly lol, but still fairly flattering. i ended up purchasing, but it is in my maybe pile for now... wil lwait before wearing it to be sure. can't wear a grey bar with it, that htin...
2564	4	a	Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not
2565	2	a	"I purchased this in the black and received it today.  it is silky feeling and is a quality camisole.  the color is a muted black, not all shiny as some silks are (and they often look cheap) but this looks great and could be worn alone, under leather, or with a sweater/kimono.  i usually wear a medium in tops, and this fit true to size.  i am 5'2"" and it doesn't look too long, but i do wish it came in a petite.  still keeping it!"
2566	1	a	Such an easy to wear and nicely cut summer dress. it does not wrinkle, has pretty colors and fits very well. i haven't washed it yet, but i like the idea that it can be machine washed. highly recommend. the fabric is good quality, a little bit thick for hot days though.
2567	0	a	I love everything about this jumper - it's so comfortable without being too warm. it's easy to dress up with booties and a hat. i suppose the only possible downside is that it's slightly tight at the ankles, but honestly - this is like a dream.
2568	1	a	I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8, went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type, but compared to the model, this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.
2569	4	a	I bought the umbrella print in the petite length. i'm pleased with the whimsical print and crisp colors. the fit is just right for me, although the style runs a bit wide at the waist. it's a casual loose fit, more fitted on top at the bust, shoulders and sleeves, and flaring out below the waist. i would wear it untucked over jeans or a narrow skirt. the only thing i'm not crazy about is the rayon fabric, though it is a substantial weight and machine washable.
2570	0	a	I ordered these leggings and loved them, for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant, leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.
2571	5	a	"This dress is so light and twirly and the fabric is as airy as it is pretty. sadly the fit was a bit off. i am 5'7"", 128. i tried on my usual sz 2 and found the top to be saggy at the armpits but too tight at the waist seam; going up to a 4 only made for a saggier top. most likely a great dress for lean or long-torsoed ladies, which sadly i'm not!"
2572	3	a	I really like this denim jacket with the plaid underneath. i also like the removable fur lining being that i live in florida i really don't need that. i ordered a size small which is my normal size and a medium. the small was tight in the arms so, i decided to keep the medium. i am really glad that i followed the others review in regards to sizing.
2573	4	a	I love this tee!!! i bought the red, and it is just so cute. the background is a light pink - and there are accents of deeper rose and mint green. i also bought the angel of the north cascade cardigan in rose, which looks great over this tee. buy it!
2574	4	a	"My size is 4 but because they did not have it i ordered 6. a little big but i can fix it.  the price was very nice.  i thought it said gray but what i got is more brown."
2575	2	a	I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.
2576	0	a	I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.
2577	1	a	This dress is absolutely like a layered cloud! the material is amazingly soft and comfy.
2578	4	a	Love the feel and comfort
2579	5	a	I was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures.  although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person, i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs.  the pictures don't really show the extreme brightness of the trim.  it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater.  to me it looked like something a child would wear.  i ordered the 1, which was the smallest size offered.  it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle.
2580	4	a	"I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to"
2581	0	a	I can't say enough about this pant! the fit is perfect, enough shape to hold you in but not so tight you think you're wearing leggings. this is my go to business casual. can't wait to get another color, my store had this in black
2582	4	a	I ordered the medium pink in a size small. the color is more of a hot pink. it runs small through the shoulders and bust (i'm 34-d). i like that it covers your bum and the detail down the back. but it is going back, i may try a medium petite in a different color.
2583	4	a	"Fits true to size! looks great just wish it was a tad longer but i am 5'10"" so..."
2584	1	a	A mango beauty that resonates the color of blossoms in bloom. comfortable, effortless, and charming. i wear a size small in retailer dresses and this one fit true to size for me. tried the xs since reviews mentioned it ran large, but too tight across my average chest. looks great with denim jacket and red suede strappy sandals. also worn with a belt to accentuate waist.
2585	3	a	I really like the look of the jacket and that it is stretching. sizing a bit odd. the xs is pretty snug in the arms, body is fitted. but the small seems 2 sizes larger. the body is very baggy. i kept the xs, but can't wear sleeves underneath!
2586	0	a	Love these jeans. wish i could snag another pair because the fit is just on point, as is the wash. the side slit at the ankle really looks great with heels. a definite buy.
2587	2	a	I bought a suit similar to this last year, and loved it! this year i bought the pineapple print, and it is beautiful (size 2). it is classy/sexy. i have a long torso, so i like that it covers me better than most one piece swim suits i try on. i highly recommend this product!
2588	2	a	Soft, comfortable, flattering, versatile--what more can you ask for? just wish it came in a long-sleeved version.
2589	0	a	I wear a 10/12. i bought a 30/31 and they fit perfect in every way! they were even almost too long so i can wear with heels if i want. i am so glad i bought these. don't let the folded cuff in the picture deceive you. a great pair of straight leg jeans!
2590	1	a	I wear an xxs petite and this dress was still large. i like that look so i'm okay with that but the sides do stick out a little bit if you have a smaller frame.
2591	4	a	I ordered the purple color and the first time i wore it, i received multiple compliments on it.  i noticed in the prior reviews that it runs big so i ordered an extra small instead of my usual small.  it fits well other than the two buttons at the top of the neck are very small and difficult to button.  i'm tempted to order the red color.
2592	4	a	It's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i can't wait for cooler weather. i tried it on with skinny jeans and it's darling. love how it's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum. perfect for leggings. nice slim, but not tight fit.
2593	5	a	The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so doesn't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. haven't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy, cool professor vibe that i like.
2594	4	a	"The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise, the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area. the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials."
2595	1	a	"I was thinking this was another maeve winner but this is actually plenty by tracy reese dress. i love the flowy fabric, the soft but vibrant colors and the gorgeous print. i wanted a size mp but that sold out so i purchased a regular m (with the intention to hem) and i find it too large in the bust. i'm going to order the sp instead too see if that fits better. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#."
2596	2	a	Cup size is really small for a medium. no way to adjust the back strap. ended up giving it to my daughter. cute but so poorly executed.
2597	4	a	"Great sweater - very pretty and warm. i would say it fits true to size, but the fit itself/style is just a little roomier - just like on the model. i usually take an xs and the xs fit great. the tag says to dry clean or hand wash in cold. i always wash my wool sweaters in cold water, in a garment bag, on delicate wash and have never had a problem. but, when i did that for this sweater, it shrunk to a size that would fit a 4 year old. the fabric in the arms stuck together, like velcro. very inter"

2600	0	a	"I've been trying on ""boyfriend"" jeans for more than a year, finally found a pair that fit and were comfortable. many of them had no stretch at all and were very uncomfortable. these have just enough stretch, but not too much. i usually wear a 29-30, tried on the 29 which were comfortable but too loose at the waist. the 28 were a perfect fit. i'm 5'8"", 140lbs."
2601	1	a	I love this dress. the fabric is butter soft, the strapless top stays in place and it hangs beautifully. it is such a wonderfully comfortable summer dress. as previously stated, i'm in love.
2602	0	a	I am amazed this is still on sale. it's so comfortable and fabulous!!
2603	1	a	
2604	4	a	"Runs true to size but some details were not as expected. the slit is only on one side and the look is more like sweater dress than sweater tunic. the length is not as long as pictured on the model. i'm 5'7 and the sweater ends half an inch below knees. the side slit starts too high, my waist is exposed unless i wear high waisted leggings. other than that the sweater is darling. the cotton (68%) and acrylic (32%) thread is soft and thin, not bulky at all. the sweater stretches lightly with wear a"
2605	1	a	"I loved this dress when i saw it. however the fit was way off. i am 5'7"" 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down. when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect. unfortunately the waist hit way too high, above my rib cage and the dress was too short. it was as if it was a petite size. i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty, easy dress to just throw on for school. unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both. the material is also not the s"
2606	4	a	I really love this shirt and bought it in several colors. i wish it came in white and in black because it's a great basic. i think it also works well for business casual attire.
2607	5	a	"This dress is just my style. i have been waiting for it to go on sale since it hit new arrivals. when the sale hit the extra 30% off, i pulled the trigger. unfortunately for me, it was a little snug in the bust and as a tall lady, the waist hit me at slightly the wrong spot. i am 5' 9"" and am a 36d. so if you are tall and busty, this will not be the dress for you just from the way it is cut and manufactured. the skirt section of the dress has a hook underneath the vest section that it is pretty"
2608	3	a	This is a beautiful piece that can be paired with multiple ways.. the color is rich and classy
2609	1	a	The fit on this dress is super flattering! i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one. i am definitely a pear shape, bigger on the bottom than the top. one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top. this is not often the case. i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it. i also love the colors. i bought the green and blue. i have worn it once
2610	4	a	"This sweater is perfect! finally a sweater that doesn't make me look like a huge box!  i bought the blue & it has other colors running through it so i'll be able to wear it with chinos & jeans. very pretty, flattering & i think i'm going to be wearing this a lot."
2611	1	a	This is just adorable on. i go between a small and medium and the small was perfect for me.. i wore this with tights and boots, but can also see this working in warmer weather with sandals or peep-toe booties.
2612	4	a	Great tee! flows well and very soft. true to size!
2613	3	a	I found this in your store and had to have it! i wore it on a date night and received more compliments than i can count!!!! the attention to detail makes this jacket special. i am 5 ft 5 inches 124lbs and a 4fits but a 6 is perfect for a sweater underneath. i actually went back a bought the other color. worth every penny.
2614	1	a	I wasn't overly impressed or drawn to this dress at first, even after i bought it, but after wearing it, i am sold! i paired the orange version with caramel colored sandals and gold jewelry. i thought it was necessary to wear a long necklace to bring some interest to the otherwise plain top. the dress is super comfortable - fabric, fit and length. it billows in such a pretty way when you walk! the color also made my skin look extra tan, which i loved! the waist is short and rides up now and then
2615	4	a	I recently bought this blouse, the soft fabric drapes nicely and the stitching is wonderful. love it!
2616	4	a	This shirt was a cute print, but it was too boxy and hit too short on the thigh. i considered having it taken in the waist but ultimately decided it wasn't worth paying the extra $ on top of the $88
2617	4	a	Very cute shirt, well made, nice detail, but a little long for my taste but i did keep it
2618	1	a	I love this dress!! it has a beautiful european flair, and more beautiful in person. i don't agree with the other reviewers that its see through-the fabric is a good quality, and thicker than you would think. the variable length is the best part of the dress. the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow!
2619	4	a	Really fantastic shirt. ordered multiple colors and will keep them all. the gray especially looks a bit boring online, but is gorgeous in real life. it has different shades mixed together and is really pretty. neckline is interesting. wish the front was a tad shorter, (i'm 5'4) but don't think petite will work. really, really great shirt.
2620	4	a	It is a little boxy, but it?s not unflattering in my opinion. the sweatshirt material is soft, the ruffles keep their shape and position, and aren?t too overwhelming on my small frame. i like the small slits on the sides, they allow the sweater to drape nicely. it also hit at a flattering spot, a little below the hip. 5?1??, 100 lbs, and got the xxs petite. this fit true to size for me.
2621	1	a	I am in lust with this fabulous dress. it's a feast for the eyes. it's so busy and detailed, yet it all works. fit on me is perfect. i did not have to size down or up. my upper torso is larger (m/l) than my bottom half (m/s). i also have a square waist. this dress makes me look like i have an hourglass figure. i love it as much as the mona dress. another point goes to ease of putting it on. i own six byron lars dresses and this is the *easiest* one to put on! just zip up and go.
2622	4	a	This top runs larger so size down. i love it besides that. it's adorable!
2623	1	a	Wanted to love this dress. the fabric is very nice, pretty colors, great quality and style. it just didn't work for my body type. it would fit great on someone with narrower shoulders. probably want to size down.
2624	1	a	"I am between a xs and s but figured i would order down based on the reviews. well, it's still huge. i have about 5 inches that i can take in from the side. i have ordered the xxs and am hoping it will look more flattering. i love the colors and design, but as it is it does not do anything for me. for reference i am 124 lbs, 32d, 5'5""."
2625	4	a	I am going to have to disagree with the first reviewer. this is not the most beautiful top i have ever purchased from retailer, but i like it. it is a nice change from the swing silhouette that tendd to look like maternity wear on me. the key to this is to tighten the drawstring a bit. it is a working drawstring all the way around, and i find that the top is much cuter with the drawstring cinched a bit. i actually like the flowing arms, too. the fabric is lightweight - nice for the very warm midwe
2626	1	a	I saw this dress and fell in love right away! this is right up my alley, super comfy, perfect fit and love the stud detail. can't wait to wear!
2627	0	a	"I tried on the grey version in store, and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee, which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5'4"" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however, the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable."
2628	4	a	This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger, a nice blue, and a good transition piece. but, the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin, but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it, but sadly, i just don't think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms, i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work, but for me at least, i think it
2629	1	a	This dress is great for hiding any insecurities. it's also very comfy.
2630	4	a	"I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a ""t"". it's soft, pretty and covers my wide bottom well."
2631	1	a	"This dress may not be worth the full price of $138 but on sale it is one huge bargain! so easy to wear and so incredibly flattering! seriously, i don't know why it's not sold out at this price! it hides all flaws without looking oversized or bulky. i totally disagree with the reviewer who called this dress ""sack"" like. found this tts. looks great with pumps or flats."
2632	1	a	This dress is absolutely amazing! i am an retailer addict, a good portion of my wardrobe is from retailer. that being said, this is one of my all time favorite purchases! this dress is a beautiful statement. i am tall and curvy and this dress fits like a glove but is very comfortable. the quality of the beading and the fabric is very good. i wore it on my hawaii vacation, and got numerous compliments! don't pass this one up! five stars!
2633	1	a	"This is absolutely beautiful.  but i am only 5'6""and the dress hits my thigh about the same place as it does on the model. one lean over to pick up my purse off the floor and i will flash everyone.   so i am going to wear it with dark denim leggings and tall boots.   likewise i did not detect even a speck of black. to me it is navy and purple. i was wishing it had black because those are my favorite leggings but quite honestly i think you're going to have to do navy or denim."
2634	1	a	I got the blue with polka dots. it fits more like a midi dress. it is a bit large, i'm usually a size 10 and got a size 8. it's gorgeous on. i don't think i'll be needing a bra underneath this. it's got a supportive band and the ribbon also helps. i might order the other bold print too, it just looks so good on.
2635	4	a	I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however, the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.
2636	1	a	The material and color of the dress were great, but the fit was rather blah. i don't think it was right for my shape. i am disappointed though, i liked design of it.
2637	0	a	Corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit well....even with stretch added. so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif mid-rise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great! they were long enough as well. i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived, it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones. how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well. these are not old lady pants either...how nice!
2638	1	a	The perfect dress for dinner date or summer weddings. or traveling. love this dress. not sure on washing yet since it is a silk dress. extremely comfortably and beautiful. i can't recall the last time i bought a new dress.
2639	2	a	This bodysuit will be a staple for me this winter. i wear it own its own and under just about everything. i just ordered another one!
2640	4	a	This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.
2641	0	a	I love these jeans. they can be dressed up or dresses down. super cute with tall boots or loafers. i wear them all the time.
2642	3	a	I remember seeing this great jackets online and knowing that i would have to have it! so i traveled to the store to try it on. the ruffle on the bottom was beautiful and fluffy and just like the pictures. the color was perfect and it was lightweight enough i could get more uses out of it that most of my coats in the texas heat. so i tried on the small. the didn't quite button over my bust, and i did an arm wiggle that made the arms too tight near where they met my body. no problem, medium it is.
2643	4	a	Bought in white. it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear.  the white is pretty sheer. will return.
2644	1	a	Beautiful dress! the pics online do not do any justice! i got compliments all day!
2645	2	a	I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which, for me, m
2646	0	a	Cute romper, love the pattern but the material seems cheap and flimsy, and is staticky! for the price it should be better quality. also i'm fairly short and hits high on the leg. not sure how anyone taller could make it work.
2647	4	a	The first day i wore this jacket to work, three people told me how great it looked. it's stylish but comfy, looks great worn with a tunic and leggings or accompanying a skirt and tights. best of all, the camel color is a great change from black and as a bonus, doesn't show my orangeish lab's dog hair!
2648	4	a	This shirt is so comfortable and looks very nice with jeans or work pants. it's a great shirt!
2649	2	a	"Love the design of these pants and they are super comfortable. perfect for running errands but managing not to look like you just rolled out of bed. bought the regular m size (usually i want petite because i'm 5'1"") and while they are a little long they still fit relatively well"
2650	4	a	I love the way this loosley falls and is so light you barely feel it on you. it is very sheer to you need to wear another tank underneath.
2651	3	a	"Just, you know, in front of my mirror and around the house. i bought this piece because i found it to be a bit funky - so you can wear it with jeans for a night out - yet with classic elements so it could be worn to work with a skirt. also, i live in florida, where it is hot hot hot, but i still like to layer my look. it has an excellent weight to it without being to heavy, so it flows well and can be worn even on the warm days instead of a suit jacket.   i am usually between a small and mediu"
2652	1	a	I love this cotton weave shift dress. it is supposed to be loose and not tight. i purchased a medium and fits the way i see it should fit. ref: 34dd, 148 lb; 5'4 height. hits above the knee but office appropriate as not too short. i paired it with a few seasons ago, the navy blue suede fringe jacket by retailer elevenses; new necklace in the blue motif from retailer ( it has a hanging druzy pendant) navy hose and navy crew neck long sleeve top.  great outfit for work and an after work party at retailer
2653	4	a	"I bought the orange in xxs petite, and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs.  i like a swing style, but this is a tent. the material in the cream is fairly sheer, and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams. the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric. they rather skew old school maternity in summation. mine are going back."
2654	1	a	Ordered a size 0, my usual at retailer... very flattering, fits well
2655	4	a	I got this top in white and it is cute. the fabric is a weird kind of polyester, and kind of shiny. i got the medium and it pulls a little around the chest. overall i like it.
2656	4	a	"I loved the material's texture and drape, but it was too sheer for me. i am 100% against having to wear a tank under white tees. (which means i have a lot of trouble finding any white tees, but...)   other than the see-through nature, i loved this shirt!"
2657	4	a	
2658	4	a	"So comfy. i'm 5'8"" a-cup & it fits well. i bought a small. an acquaintance of mine has it & she's petite w boobs & it looks great on her too. she has black & i have lavender. great purchase!"
2659	1	a	This is a lovely dress, with great fabrication. nice detail on the zipper placket. good material. however, it runs small in the waist, if you had a nymph waist this is for you! i couldn't get it zipped.
2660	0	a	"I love this pant. it is so soft and has some stretch in it. the first pair i tried in a size 10 and the sales associate suggested trying a size 12 as ithis pant should not fit tight as it is a trouser. tie 12 is perfect. it reminds me of a ""retro"" pant,which i love."
2661	2	a	Nice quality, but enough material for two sets of tights. can scrunch up at the bottom for a different look.
2662	1	a	I ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black. they were not ! they were wine colored. i liked the color, but not in combination with the other colors in the dress. black would have been a better look. i had to take it back. sad...
2663	1	a	I agree, this dress runs long, but since i love high heels, it falls just right for me. it does seem quite roomy for a medium, which is a pleasant surprise. the fabric, drape and quality are contemporary but i know i'll be wearing this beyond this year for sure.
2664	1	a	Oh my goodness, i paid full price for this dress because i loved it so much. i styled it with a cream lace poncho , also from retailer, and it is gorgeous. at the sale price, you can't lose.
2665	4	a	I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors, really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t
2666	4	a	"I love the idea of this coat and foolishly purchased other items in happy anticipation of its arrival.  the description does not say ""lined,"" and i hoped for soft wool that i recently got on the ""yellow with white piping"" sweater coat. this is hard, coarse, itchy wool - impossible for me to wear an unlined garment. i am consistently puzzled by the high prices for garments that are unlined when they really need to be. it went back, and i cannot really recommend this as i know i am not the only"
2667	4	a	"This top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased. i really love it. it is different than i thought it would be. i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow. definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large.  definitely recommend."
2668	0	a	This is a gem. stretchy, graphic, easy to wear, lightweight and so fun! the best thing about this is it can be worn as a jumpsuit or as a higher waisted pant! i've seen it paired with a pilcro denim jacket and cute sandals, and then worn as pants with a black tank, jacket and silver belt. i love that this can be dressed up or down...you could even throw it on over your bathing suit as a coverup. i would go true to size on this one since there is some room and the top has great stretch.
2669	4	a	Very sheer inexpensive material. even on sale i'm returning it
2670	1	a	Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.
2671	1	a	"Bought this for my brother's wedding and i just received it. i ordered my usual size xs. it's a tightly woven knit, with little to no stretch in it. i could barely get it over my head and my arms could barely fit in the sleeves. and i don't have big arms at all. for reference, i'm pushing 5'7"", around 125 lbs. i'm glad it's so structured because i was worried that it would lose it's shape with this material make-up. but, no. it's really fitted. alas, i need to try again with the next size up. ma"
2672	1	a	I'm so impressed with the beautiful color combinations and embroidery but disappointed in the rayon fabric used, especially at this price point.  the sleeveless sheer blue outer dress is a flowy swing silhouette that retains many wrinkles.  i have thick shoulders and upper arms, so the armholes cut into my armpits.  the silky rayon liner is a blush rose color with adjustable spaghetti straps.  the slip has no stretch and feels a bit tight on my chest.  i ordered size medium petite and my stats a
2673	1	a	"I searched far and wide for this dress. after ordering an 8, 10 and 12 from 3 different stores in two different cities, in a span of 2 months, i finally settled on the 10! i literally went searching for this while on vacation, too. i'm 5'5.5"", 160 lbs and 36c bust and the 10 fit perfectly. this dress is adorable and i've worn it to the office and on the weekends. this will definitely be in my biweekly rotation this summer. the quality is on point and it was definitely worth the price tag. i was"
2674	4	a	Fit is boxy yet flattering and material is sheer but not overly delicate. took my usual size four, i am moderately short waisted.
2675	1	a	This dress is absolutely beautiful. i was hesitant to purchase it due to the price, but i just couldn't resist. it's so flowy and comfortable. it's quite long on me; i'm 5'5 and have to wear heels so that it doesn't drag, but could easily be fixed with alerations. i wore this to a wedding and received so many compliments.
2676	0	a	"Fabulous colors, great fabric, super comfy and extremely versatile. i love, love, love this skirt. although i'm only 5'1"", the regular 2 was still above my knee so it might be a bit short for really tall gals. the waistband is a bit wide, but with a cropped top or tying a button down as shown, i found it very flattering. love the texture of the fabric and the slightly retro print and it doesn't seem to wrinkle (after getting out the original packaging creases). it honestly goes with everything a"
2677	4	a	"So i tried on the regular size in the store, and love the top, but looked too big on me.  color is gorgeous and rich, the sheer adds a little whimsical to it, and i love the tie-neck trend of lately. would go nicely with jeans (skinny or flare) or trousers, not sure about a skirt though,."
2678	4	a	Great quality, i didn't expect the neck to be so wide but it still looks nice.
2679	0	a	These are great jeans and worth every penny. they hug every curve and have just enough give in the places that you need them. i find them to be very figure-flattering and dressed them up with high heeled boots and a nice blouse. even though i'm petite, i ordered a regular in my size (26) because i wanted the length of regular jeans as opposed to ankle length.
2680	4	a	I like this top a lot, and have always liked knotted looks around the bust area. i do not have a large chest, and this kind of top always draws attention in all the right places. i was worried the cut would be too low for my comfort level-and it is low but the shirt does not come away from my body in normal movements so i do feel completely comfortable wearing this without a cami underneath. i don't prefer this in black because i think the color detracts from the bunches of fabric created by the
2681	4	a	I had high hopes for this coat, but it was a miss for me. while the wool is soft and not itchy, the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy.  also, the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located.  i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was, but alas, i just could not get over the poor tailoring.  for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs) and it was big.
2682	4	a	This top is amazing!! i thought it looked really cute in the photos but it's even cuter online. the material is great and you can't go wrong with the fit. i love tops that are loose and flowy, so when i'm feeling a bit bloated i can still look cute in tops. this one is definitely a must!
2683	1	a	I love the color and the style, however it doesn't look as well as the model as i don't have a small waist like the model does. still overall, i love this dress and it is well made and comfortable
2684	1	a	I'm glad i discovered this super easy to wear, flattering summer dress on a recent store visit. if i had only seen it online, i'm not sure i would have ordered it. i prefer it styled with flat sandals for an effortless boho look. i'm 5'5, slim and small chested and xs fit perfectly.
2685	4	a	Bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes. had little to no shape to it. some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for. i feel like being short, i just looked kind of dumpy on me. fabric is nice but borders on see through. it was just ok....nothing exciting.
2686	1	a	Gorgeous, but so, so, small. recommend ordering 2 sizes up.
2687	1	a	"This is a beautiful dress (and my husband agrees). i'm 5'5"", 114lb and the xs was long on me and a bit baggy on top. i looked in to having it taken up, but i think that will be hard to do without damaging much of what's elegant about the dress. i hope that someone with more curves and a bit more height is able to enjoy this one."
2688	3	a	"I love the way this coat looks in the website. it turned out to be a little different than i thought it would be. can't decide if i will keep it. the sleeves are bracelet length, i have long arms so slightly awkward for me. i ordered the small even though i wear a medium in everything else (5'8"", 135 #). so glad i did because it is biggish on me. it is unlined but made of a lovely, soft wool. the edges are all finished with a bias edging which is unique and well done. it is boxy, very. lovely wo"
2689	4	a	Wow im really glad i didn't listen to the negative reviews! in ordered this top in the black and red and i have to say this is one of my favorite tops! the neck line i agree does need to be secured. i wish they would have added a snap. it's fine though as i don't mind sewing it closed. this top is worth it! i'm 5'2 108 lbs and small chested. so for slim girls i think this is perfect!
2690	2	a	This dress is the best casual find. goes with everything- flips flops, tennys, jean jacket. feels little sporty and the orange was a cool addition to my closet.
2691	1	a	I'll start by saying, over the years, i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap, cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean, this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.
2692	4	a	"The photos don't look it, but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3"" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall.   disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!"
2693	1	a	I've never owned a romper, and never had any desire to. but the classy design in black, soft, flowy fabric reeled me in, prompting me to push my boundaries a bit. i'm so glad i did. i don't think i have any other piece of clothing that makes me feel so classy or so fun, and certainly not at the same time. i wear it to work in an office environment with a cardigan, and the cardigan goes off after work as i run errands or play with the kids. i love it!! (and it even has pockets - i'm a sucker for
2694	4	a	"I love this sweater. i found it in the sale section a few weeks ago but wasn't sure if it would be too bulky. it had a dark smudge on the collar left from someone or something. i thought maybe it had been left behind by others for that reason because the quality was so nice. thankfully, i washed it and the smudge came out.    i live in houston, tx and don't need to wear wool or cashmere sweaters for warmth. this is mostly cotton. it is well made. the sleeves were longer on me than the model,"
2695	4	a	I would never had bought this top if i hadn't seen it previously in the store. the look in the picture is not flattering at all (too frumpy with the wide pants). the many details work well with pastel tones. very bohemian look so make sure you balance that with modern bottoms and edgy shoes. might be a problem washing it because all of the details: mini pearls and golden thread but you got to do what you got to do...
2696	1	a	Very flattering! i am petite, but have large breasts. so, i expected this dress to look boxy on me. but the flowy fabric falls perfectly on the body and shows just the right amount of shape. the pattern is beautiful and perfect for the cooler seasons. the dress is also very versatile. it can be dressed up with heels and a jacket, or down with flats and a denim vest or jacket. i know i'm going to wear this dress over and over this fall and winter.
2697	1	a	I tried this on at the suggestion of one of the sales girls. i was skeptical of the simple shape, but when i put on the green one, i didn't want to take it off-ever. i am 6' and thin- the small fits me perfectly. i loved it so much, i purchased the blue as well. love, love, love!
2698	4	a	"The colors are amazing, the fabric is beautiful; my only complaint is the cut. i am 5'8"" 130 lb and always a medium. i put the sweater on and the armhole area was short so it kept riding up- it almost fit like a petite with the higher cut in waist tailoring. i liked the sweater color and fabric so much i exchanged for a large."
2699	4	a	The photos don't do the top justice. the split back is very unique and adorable. i typically take a size 8 in tops, but ordered a 12 since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders. the 12 shoulder fit perfectly, but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in. i like it enough that i'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body. with the sale price, it is worth tailoring.
2700	1	a	I love the look of this dress but wish the bottom was lined like the top is. it's a little sheer without the lining.
2701	2	a	I purchased the teal suit and it was so beautiful! it's super comfortable and has nice coverage. i decided to return it because, as a nursing mom i've decided to wait until i've weaned the baby so i can make sure the fit is still good. but otherwise i would have kept it!
2702	4	a	Very cool top! i purchased this in the black, which is more of a very dark gray (imagine sanded silk). it's very figure flattering and accentuates curves. it also disguises any minor tummy issues. not to clingy, but follows your form. the fabric is well made with a perfect drape to match the style. definitely a winner!
2703	0	a	These pants are beautiful and so comfortable. the liner is a nice surprise. they can be casual or dressed up with a jacket. i'm so pleased to have gotten them on sale!
2704	0	a	These shorts are divine. the fabric is sturdy and there is a weave of sparkle that i did not perceive from the picture.
2705	0	a	"I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight, totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you've owned them for years, they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on.  ---------- i am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans, and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well. i do not have an hourglass figure (my shou"
2706	4	a	
2707	0	a	These chinos fit great! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear. i bought all 3 colors!
2708	4	a	My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store. this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture. it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter.
2709	1	a	I got this because it was on sale and it looked like a fun design.  i like it so much more than i expected to!  the material drapes beautifully so the lower parts skims my body while the upper part moves nicely but doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;t stick out too much.  i love the green color too!  i tie the ties on the back of the dress--at the level of my shoulder blades--rather than on top as in the photo.  i think it looks cuter that way.  so glad i took a chance on it!
2710	4	a	I had bought the pull over in the same fabric and now this zipper jacket style. so fun and love the texture. i waited for markdown plus promo and it was worth waiting.
2711	1	a	"I read the online reviews and thought this dress would be a winner. it is tight in the chest (i am not busty) and i would have exchanged it for a larger size but i just didn't like the style. the material is beautiful but between the neutral colors and the style, i felt it was too ""little house on the prairie"". pretty but not the look i was going for."
2712	0	a	The colors and design of this skirt are beautiful. the fabric hangs nicely. the color i more burnt orange than red. i ordered my usual size (6), but it is too small.
2713	1	a	This dress is beautiful--lovely colors and design--but it's huuuge. i'm usually a s/m in tops and dresses, but i got an xs after trying it on in the store. i'm busty and have hips and still have a bit of room. the length is good--a little above the knee but still work appropriate. with my curves it's not my most flattering dress since it pretty much falls straight down, but i think it's too pretty not to keep.
2714	1	a	"This dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice. it does have an a-line fit in the skirt. the stitching is beautiful. honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me. some may like that, but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted. the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress. the fabric is cotton and it is not lined. i am 5'9"" and it does hit right about where it does on the model. i am sending it back, because i didn't say ""wow, i love this"" w"
2715	3	a	This jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture, color is very close too. i normally wear a 4-6 top (sometimes s sometimes m). the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms - the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back). i love this jacket though! the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it!
2716	1	a	I took everyone's advice and purchased a size small instead if medium.  i wish i had gotten my usual size as the neckline and bodice is very tight.  i'm top heavy with a wide rib cage and 36dd's.   other than that, the skirt of this mango hued beauty is large loose and flowing which i can see why people suggest sizing down.  i think my fit problem would be solved if petite was available.
2717	0	a	I have been searching for these pants my whole life. i have them in several colors. i wear the moss most often. i'd recommend your normal size or size down if in between sizes. they stretch a bit as you wear them. one other thing- after being washed and dried the color has lightened significantly.
2718	2	a	"This is made of soft, sweatshirt material. it is one of those dresses that you can put on with sandals or birkinstocks and go out to breakfast or throw it on to go to the beach or wear after yoga. this is not a ""dressy"" dress. that said, i love it. i used to have a sweatshirt dress from another brand that i wore out and have been searching for the replacement. this color is a pale celadon, a tad bit more vibrant than the photo, which makes it more flattering than you may think. i wear a 4-6 and"
2719	1	a	This dress is lovely in person- light rose color and quality fabric. i'm a 32c and had to go down from my usual 2 to a 00 to get a proper fit in the bust and bodice. the full skirt leaves plenty of room to size down if necessary. this would work best on someone with a larger bust and small waist, but because of the cut i recommend trying on before buying. if you are smaller busted, the front tie can be adjusted slightly to get a better fit. the skirt portion is unlined, though, the fabric is thi
2720	0	a	Overall, very nice pair of boyfriend style jeans. super comfy. i asked one of the in store stylist for help styling them- she was very helpful and showed me lots of possibilities for these pants. also good for a post-partum tummy :)
2721	0	a	Love this color! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on! so pretty! if you love pilcro chinos--you will be happy with these! same great fit and an awesome color!
2722	0	a	I don't if it is me, but usually i am a solid size 6, occasionally an 8.  i had to size up to a 10! the wool is very light, and while it is a weird texture, it isn't scratchy. i liked how the skirt was styled at the store...looks better than it does in the photos online.
2723	4	a	The quality of this blouse is great. a bit on the thick side which i like. the fronts a bit shorter than the back. looks great with joggers or jeans. great neckline and design. i bought this in black and wore it with camo pants and sandals. love it!
2724	4	a	
2725	0	a	"This super cute skirt has a beautiful drape and overall fit. i was afraid the tie at the front would emphasize my slight tummy, but to the contrary, the skirt is flattering and slimming. at 5'3"", the front of the skirt hits at my upper to mid knee. 118 lbs., 26"" waist, 36"" hips, size 2 regular is a perfect fit."
2726	2	a	These tights have a nice pattern and color. they look just like the photograph. they are warm and because they are warm they have wool in them and they are a little itchy. but, that's the price you pay for warmth. i own several pairs of retailer tights and love the patterns (foxes, scotty dogs, and now trees). .
2727	5	a	"Dress is beautiful in person, light material that is excellent for summer.  this dress is not forgiving in the chest, so ladies if you bigger chested i suggest going up a size or two. i'm 5'4, 145 lbs and 34ddd, i usually wear 8 or 10, this dress in a 10 made my look like i was wearing an unflattering sports bra."
2728	1	a	"I'm 5'4"" 120# , 34d. this dress did nothing for me. the seem on the side with the knot doesn't look right. it's almost on the side but not really. there's a seem down the center of the butt from the waist. it looks weird from the back because it's such a fine striped print. not flattering at all. the dress is comfortable due to the stretchy knit and it has a stretchy knit lining. hit me just a bit lower than on the model."
2729	2	a	I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4, 155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me, with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person, like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer, so you would need to wear a slip, and the elastic waist still has somewhat of
2730	4	a	
2731	4	a	Definitely size up...possibly two sizes. i can often wear an xs and the s is skin tight on me. other than that, it's a nice neutral piece.
2732	4	a	Love this sweater. comfy and trendy. can't wait to wear with my new retailer knit leggings!
2733	1	a	"Saw this dress in the blue motif and thought it would be perfect for a summer outdoor wedding. i'm 5'4"" 125 lbs and ordered a size 2. it fit true to size in the shoulders, bust and length, but did not fit as pictured on the site; it looks in the pictures like there is some shape to the waistline without being too fitted, which i like. on me there was absolutely no shape. it just billowed and looked really maternity. 15 bucks for alterations to take in the sides and now it's my favorite darn thin"
2734	0	a	"These jeans fit great, but i think getting the right size is key. i bought my usual denim size 26 and at first i thought they were too tight. but as the day wore on, they softened and conformed to my body and fit like a glove. if i bought them in a larger size, i'm afraid they'd bag out like jeans tend to do. i think it's the ""legging"" style that makes them so form fitting. i wish they were ankle length like on the model, but i'm 5'5"" and they are quite a bit longer on me than the model."
2735	4	a	
2736	0	a	I've been looking for a versatile maxi skirt all season. the pleats and layered look were a great effect to a really basic navy maxi skirt. the waist is elastic (great for after baby) and will look good with a shirt tucked in and belt. the only drawback is that it's a little too long and will drag on the ground if i wear flats (i'm 5'7''). soft material with some flowy movement when you walk.
2737	3	a	I love this jacket. i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times. the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting. it fits tts. i am typically an xl and i ordered that size- i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me. the pictures on the website don't do it justice. it looks much nicer in person.
2738	4	a	I ordered the teal color - it is a beautiful color. the fit is a bit odd like one other person commented, but the pros outweigh the cons. i am thinking of ordering the other colors too.
2739	2	a	"This is a beautiful swim suit! the overall look is lovely; the ruffle is sweet and the low-cut front keeps it just the right amount of sexy for a one piece. i didn't keep it only because i would have preferred the leg opening to be cut a little higher. otherwise, it fit very well. i'm 5'10"" and 150, with broad shoulders and a substantial rack (nursing a baby right now) and i didn't have any problems with support. great buy!"
2740	1	a	This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me, the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.
2741	1	a	The horizontal lines on the skirt and top gives the wearer and very nice dress. i am short so i got the 6 petite and it fits perfectly. the fabric is thick and stretchy.
2742	3	a	Perfect fall accessory and transitional piece for cooler days. classic red and black check with a fashion flair. great with jeans or dress it up with jewelry. a great find!
2743	4	a	I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!
2744	3	a	"I am 5 feet and 120. i ordered a petite small in moss. i have posted a photo below. it's a pretty green. the lining is pretty. the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and ""slips"" a little when putting the jacket on. but it doesn't effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably. it's floppy, but not sloppy. i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip. it was a nice surprise. i'm curvy and busty. i have zero problem with it being unflattering. the s"
2745	4	a	Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color.
2746	4	a	I ordered the navy/gray version in size xl. it fits me true to size, matching the online photos. the colors matched too. the fabric is so soft. it's warm while being lighter in weight. very comfortable. the collar wasn't bulky either. it's made to last. one of my retailer favorites.
2747	1	a	Gorgeous dress but fits really large. ordered a petite large. going to send it back and try the petite medium. wish it was available at my store to try on and not have to wait for it to be reshipped.
2748	4	a	This sweater came in just as expected . . . adorable. as others have said, it is soft and comfy. i will wear it everywhere (including work). i love it! :)
2749	1	a	Overall, it's a beautiful dress, and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you'd expect for the price), and as other reviewers have mentioned, it's just a tad too short. for reference, i'm 5'5, 125 lbs and the 2 fit well, but hung well above my knees. there's no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned.
2750	4	a	This top is very cute, but i found it runs small in the bust, which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up, if you have a generous bust.
2751	4	a	"I saw this dress online and i ordered immediately! it has everything i love: my fav color, a peplum and feminine cut out details. i ordered my usual size medium, and it was too tight in the chest, and i am just average... 34c. loved it so reordered in a size large. if you are thinking of purchasing this beauty i would suggest going up a size if you are on the upper end of your size (medium 8/10 and i am usually a 10 so needed to go up) the reason i gave the quality a lower rating is that the med"
2752	0	a	This jumpsuit is so so comfy i can't wait to wear it! def runs on the large size.
2753	2	a	I saw these in the store and was smitten. ordered online and have not been disappointed. love the pattern, the feel, and the fit. comfortable, fun and interesting. the regular length ones are definitely full-length on me but not too long. i might have gone with the petite length except that they didn't seem available, but am perfectly happy with the regular length.
2754	4	a	I was really excited for this sweater, its not terrible but its not great. the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it. it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it. i would try a different sweater.
2755	0	a	"Oh this skirt is gorgeous but i feel it runs small in the waist!! i'm sending it back and ordered up- i'm happy i did as today it's sold out. beautiful and vibrant colors, very well made- just wish some of the retailer sizes wouldn't run on the smaller side!!!"
2756	2	a	This twist front top fits true to size, it is perfect! i really love the ruched sides, i like a longer tankini but most of them the stomach area is too wide and flowy. this one is perfect, it hugs your sides and looks great to wear with my kids but still flirty with my husband! i got the navy top and the side tie bottoms in navy/periwinkle and they are so cute together, can't wait to hit the beach!!
2757	4	a	
2758	4	a	Great top for the older woman who wants to be stylish but needs a little extra room. the subtle color goes with anything. i love it!!
2759	1	a	I was so excited to get this dress. i saw someone try it on in the store and waited all season for it to go on sale. i loved it except for the seam that was right at the neckline in the front. they didn't even try to match up the fabrics. it was so obvious and cheap looking that i had to send this dress back. so sad!
2760	4	a	This is a lovely cardigan--especially over dresses with leggings, over-the-knee socks, and boots. i was so ecstatic to get it at the black friday price. the description says its white but it's more like a cream. it was for this reason that i initially reconsidered the purchase. i was hoping for more of an off-white or winter white as it appears on the model. except, it looked so great over dresses and suitable for the southern california winter. i didn't care for the wrap belt. it just looked li
2761	4	a	I agree a few others, it may be a little bit boxy but i don't even care because it's so beautiful! definitely a top i'm going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade.
2762	1	a	This dress was absolutely beautiful in person, but it didn't end up working out for me. i wear a 10, the 10 fit, but i have a 34g chest and because of that the waistline didn't sit low enough - it was just below my bust instead of at my natural waist. i really wanted this to work and think it would be great for the right person. seemed tts. love the detailing!
2763	4	a	Comfortable, thick material ( think: structured sweatshirt material) easy to throw on and look as if effort was made - when it wasn't. sizing. i'm between a large and xl usually. large was perfect. i'm tall and curvy: ( 36g curvy) and this cardigan/ belted jacket/is very flattering.
2764	1	a	The blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure
2765	2	a	
2766	4	a	My new favorite top to throw on
2767	1	a	The fabric is beautiful, the embroidery quite striking, and the length is perfect. however, the dress is a bit amorphous; and as others have mentioned, the sleeves are silly. so i took the dress to my favorite seamstress, and she added a couple of darts in the back and fixed the sleeves - voila!. these weren't expensive fixes, and now the dress is perfect.
2768	4	a	I am normally an xs or s in tanks, so ordered the size 6. looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love that it's a cotton denim but it doesn't have any stretch. love the look & the fabric, but the neck area feels slightly restrictive in the front & i think it wld creep up & pull on me when wearing. fabric is slightly stiff & the flared bottom just sticks out. armholes do cover the bra & length hits at the top of the hips on me. going to return the 6, but will try the 8 if the local store has it.
2769	1	a	"I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however, the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else.   sadly, dress had to be returned."
2770	2	a	These leggings are so thick and soft! they feel like velvet on your skin. i am so, so happy with my purchase, and would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a unique, comfortable, and quality pair of leggings.
2771	0	a	I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then, because i loved the cut of these pants, bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again, nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur
2772	4	a	I cannot believe how different this top looks in person. i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately. viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice. it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women. the cut is not too low and lays beautifully.
2773	0	a	I love the cut of these pants! kind of a flare, kind of a boot cut and super flattering. they are long so really need heels to keep a nice leg. they have tons of stretch so i could wear two different size. i choose the smaller for a little less length in the leg. i consider them more pants then denim.
2774	4	a	So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it, i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing, the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i'm a 36 dd and mostly a size l, so that's what i ordered. it wasn't snug, but it didn't have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look, so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too, but i could have rolle
2775	0	a	"These pants are amazing! i love that they zip in the back and the material is just right. i am 5'7"" and they are the perfect length. i bought the black and now buying the gray. i hope they come out with more colors!!!"
2776	0	a	I am 5'5 about 110 lbs and the size 0 regular fits me well. sometimes i order petite, but the regular fit me just right. they are higher waisted than most pants i wear, but they are completely adorable and comfortable to boot. love the pattern. the sturdy quality is tangible. definitely going to order more of these pants in different patterns as they become available.
2777	5	a	Love the look of this and the fabric, but runs way small. i usually wear a 0. ordered the 0, then 2. just got the 4 and it's still too small. will be returning all 3.
2778	1	a	I ordered this dress in two colors and i'm happy that i did!  very cute and great fit!  flattering too!
2779	1	a	This pajama-like dress is not worth $150 (full price plus tax in texas), so i can't really justify keeping it. i kept having to pull it over on one side so it would align correctly. it also runs big. i bought the m (which i am returning) and it bunches at the waist but the length was perfect. the s is too short on the bottom. i love the color, but it's going back. i'd buy it if it were on sale.
2780	2	a	"I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown. if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it. i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight. on the upside, the fabric was soft and lightweight."
2781	4	a	"But runs large. i tried on the regular 0 in the store and it was very pretty but baggy. would definitely need a tank if i were to wear this to work. lace is romantic and i do like the button details. i would give it a try but for me i will take my chance and wait for sale if it makes it there in my sie. i need 00. petite already gone sadly.   reference 115 lbs 30dd and 26.5 on waist."
2782	4	a	I was excited to receive this top. it looked great online, vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves. when i tried it on, the fabric looked and felt cheap. it is not a flowy top. do not recommend it.
2783	4	a	I've been stalking this top online and finally went into the store today to see it.  i'm so glad i did!  the colors are very vibrant and the material is soft and very lightweight.  the cut covers a regular bra pretty well (a big plus!) and makes my arms look good!  i can't wait to wear this, it will be a perfect dressy top for the higher heat days!
2784	4	a	Cute top. i always get compliments when i wear it. a little boxy in style
2785	1	a	Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i'd try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however, like others have commented, it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.
2786	4	a	"I bought this top in both colors. the fit is perfect, the styling is very cute and it also is very comfortable!! the only bad thing is that it snags on my jewelry !! :(. if it weren't for that i would rate it a 5!!"
2787	2	a	The softest cotton gauze but, not see through. relaxed but, the sleeves & neckline make it flattering. a gorgeous blue in person. so in love with this dress, going back for it in white!
2788	4	a	I love a good white blouse and this shirt does not disappoint. the detailing of the lace and bead work make it extra special. i just love it. it can be dressed up or worn with jeans. it runs a bit wide. i normally don't buy a petite in tops because i am long in the body but i did with this one after i tried the regular.
2789	5	a	Never spent this much on a dress so it needs to be amazing for me to keep it.  i've never seen flannel patterns and colors like this. the details in the back are unique. but in the end, i decided to return because it's too long and although it fit fine in a size large it didn't look that great on me. the dress has an exaggerated drop waist that was too low for my short waisted frame. the fabric smells odd. i tried belting it but the pockets and back buttons created bulk.
2790	4	a	Love the weight. something i can wear winter and spring.
2791	4	a	I gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it! i get many compliments on this top! i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls :)
2792	0	a	Great jeans!!! i'm over 60 & it's difficult finding jeans. these fit like a glove, with just enough stretch & the twisted hem adds a bit of unexpected style. i liked them so much, i ordered another pair!
2793	4	a	"It took a minute, but once i figured out how to wear this, i loved it. it is meant to be oversized, and for me looks best with leggings and ankle boots (too much bulk to be worn with even a slim skirt). i'm 5'9"", curvy and long limbed. the fabric has a thick, high quality feel; i find it quite soft and comfy. the unexpected design of the ribbing gives it a subtle chic; it's fashion forward without trying too hard. the ""cowl"" is really closer to a boatneck with an extra fold, which works well for"
2794	3	a	Love marrakech for their jackets! this piece is wonderful! i usually wear an xs or s in this brand in jackets. i went with an xs as the sleeve are a little loose. the body still fits buttoned up- nice and tailored. the stretch keeps in comfy with the tailored fit in the trunk. looks great worn open too. i think the best part is the cut and material. i am 5 '4 and 125 lbs, curvy.
2795	0	a	These are awesome! i have the pink which is a very light faded sort of color. they are beautiful and very nice quality. they are slimmer and stretchier then i imagined but very flattering.
2796	5	a	I got this dress for my younger sister who's in the process of losing weight. she's currently wearing a size 12 with comfort room but can occasionally squeeze into smaller sizes depending on the product. this dress is deceptively true to size. at first glance it looks like a roomy dress but the inner part of the dress zips up real tight. as a result, the boxy top part of the dress doesn't look too big and is in fact very flattering. the dress is very silky and looks as high quality as its price.
2797	3	a	I love this blazer because it feels like a sweater but has the formal structure of a blazer. great for fall!
2798	1	a	Thin for this late in the season, but the colors are so pretty. i'm going to layer it over a long sleeve t, top with a cardi and pair with leggings. runs large. love the the unconnected slip. 5 stars.
2799	1	a	This dress looks so plain on this model you'd never guess it looks so adorable on. i saw it as i walked into my local retailer and tried it on quickly over skinny jeans i was wearing with grey suede boots and it looked amazing! it's a perfect teacher dress. wear it over tights or jeans during colder weather, chunky sandals during warmer weather. it has side pockets i absolutely love. you must try it on to believe it. the fabric is soft and of great quality.
2800	4	a	Love this top! i just purchased this shirt from my local retailer store. i noticed it when i walked in and saw it on display. it's stylish, comfortable, and subtle. it runs large so size down. normally, i wear a medium in retailer tops but needed a small. the flower print is small and the colors are muted against the black. pairs well with several colors: black (like model), dark denim, olive green, and mauve. the display had it tucked into a soft khaki colored pair of pants that worked as well.
2801	4	a	"I was unsure about this top at first because of reviews saying ""maternity""and this shirt can have that feel if you look at it from that point. i tried it again and the arm holes fit perfectly. it has a swing cut and a peplum style which brings lots of fabric and swing. it's not that it runs big it's supposed to swing/flow from body like many styles but the peplum adds bulk because it's a little thicker fabric. so i can see how some may think maternity because of all the fabric and cut, but i lov"
2802	1	a	I am still in love with my ribboned denim dress from earlier this year. so, when i saw this dress i was super excited and ordered it right away in the same size. it just came and... i'm kinda disappointed. the fit is... shrunken?? kind of like i'm wearing a petite size. it's around 3 to 4 inches shorter, the tie at the waist hits instead right under my bust, and there's some weird bunching happening above my rear?? i kept wanting to pull the whole dress down more, but that's just the way it was
2803	4	a	I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did. mine does not have any weird smell at all. i ordered a medium and i wear a size 8. it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings ...with coverage. the detailing on the yoke is so pretty. i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better. i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe!!
2804	1	a	"The cotton, the print, and the online presentation of this dress are beautiful, i ordered right away! but there are some discrepancies. the shoulders have a ""puff"" to them that i don't notice on the model, and that doesn't flatter athletic shoulders. the buttons are (cheap) difficult to button. the waist sits much lower on the model than it must on anyone else, it's nearly empire on me. and, there is a lot more volume in the skirt of the dress than is shown in any photo. because the dress is tig"
2805	4	a	This top has really beautiful lace detail. the color is much deeper pink than the picture online. i ordered the xs petite and it fits fine but i like my tops longer so i wish i had gotten the regular xs instead. it is very pretty!
2806	4	a	I love this top so much i bought it in 3 colors. the material is so soft and comfortable. has a slight fitting in the waist to make it very flattering. you can wear the next as pictured or button it up and slouch it and it looks great both ways. perfect with jeans or dress it up with slacks. just wish it wasn't dry clean only.
2807	1	a	If you have an hourglass figure this dress accentuates your curves. i do need to wear a tank underneath as dress is low cut.
2808	4	a	The sweater is comfortable and has a little 70s fabric flair...not quite as classically modern as it looks on the model. i am keeping it because it is a true fall/spring item. not a fabric weight for summer wear in california. the peach color is pretty muted, so it is not a show-stopping going-out piece.
2809	4	a	Saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning. i usually wear a size 8 because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a 6 in this top. it was not tight in the arms (don't have super skinny arms) and the fabric flows nicely (not too much). the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit!
2810	0	a	"I tried on these pants and was instantly in love. they are very flattering and stylish, but also incredibly comfortable. i am 5' 6"", and the length is perfect to wear with 3"" heels. i highly recommend these!"
2811	3	a	"Love the coat. style and fit are a perfect fit. true to size. thanks for the previous reviews about the button. i am extra careful taking it on and off. versatile. take the collar off and wear on a sweater or whatever inspires you."
2812	4	a	I absolutely adore this shirt, it is such a comfortable material and goes great with a pair of jeans! i love how it fits tightly in the sleeves and flows out at the bottom just the right amount. i highly recommend adding this to your wardrobe.
2813	0	a	"These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter, but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight, but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back!   for reference ( if you decide to try your luck), i am 5'7"", 128# and my normal size s was perfect."
2814	4	a	Very warm and snuggly, gorgeous color, nice fit. i have a little trouble getting the neck to lay right, but managed so it works for work. i can't say enough how toasty it is. very good quality and styling.
2815	4	a	I love this sweater because it is so versatile! it looks casual with jeans, but i plan to wear it to the opera with dressy black slacks. the beautiful black embroidery is unusual and asymmetrical in back.
2816	1	a	"It is a pretty dress but not what i had hoped for (i ordered it online.) i like slits on sleeves but the dress doesn't fit me well, so i plan to return it. p.s. it has pockets! :-)"
2817	1	a	I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue, but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide, shapeless, and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite, i'm not sure it's worth the price, because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.
2818	3	a	I bought this recently and it is already a go-to piece in my wardrobe. i love it to dress things up for work. it is extremely comfortable and easy to wear.
2819	4	a	This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.
2820	0	a	It is soooo cute!!! i'm trying to figure a few things before deciding to keep..... how one goes to the bathroom when wearing it? i can't figure out how to get it on without help tying the straps in the back?
2821	1	a	This dress is nicely made , fits well and is the right length.
2822	0	a	"I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however, after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6"", size 4, hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure."
2823	4	a	Cute staple in classic style overall.  fabric weight is good, will be able to get by with nude bra.  many wardrobe options with this staple.
2824	0	a	"This jumpsuit is fabulous in person! it is elegant and easy and very figure flattering. i have a very curvy shape but a 34 ddd bust so i would say i am a top heavy hourglass. this jumpsuit does me right. the only thing i would say is i don't think it would be very comfortable on a person with a long torso. i am 5'3"" and bought this in 6 regular and the length is perfect with heels. but the whole top half fits me perfectly but shows alot of boob if i'm not careful. but i don't think it would be s"
2825	0	a	I tried these on in in a 27/4 in the store and they were a bit snug. they graciously offered to look online and found the 28/6. they arrived in less than a week and are perfect. a note was enclosed saying they actually ran out of this size but another store was able to find them and ship...i love that retailer did not even call and worry me over it, they just fixed the problem. thank you!
2826	4	a	This is a great little top. the tie sits right at the waist and loose enough to slide over top of pants or shorts. the detailing at neck and shoulders is very eye catching. i received several compliments when i wore it.
2827	4	a	"Cute shirt. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. size s fits perfectly. a little shorter in the back than i'd like but great for layering."
2828	4	a	This was a near miss for me. i love the concept of the asymmetrical shoulder cutouts and the contrast of the beadwork to the simple gray crewneck, however, with some of the beads bulging out about 1/4 inch from the shirt, i have to say it almost bordered on gawdy christmas sweater status... but still cool. i actually thought this piece felt fairly sturdy and well-made, but the thing that got me and led me to return it was that even in an xs it was indeed cut wide. if it were a little shorter it
2829	0	a	I absolutely love these shorts and have them in 3 colors. they are a great price point and comfortable fit. be careful with washing as the darker colors seem to bleed.
2830	0	a	"These chinos are really soft and comfortable, but they run really large. i have the 27 petite (5'4"" 115 lbs.) and they are too big. i originally bought the 28 petite and exchanged them for the 27 and after wearing the 27s all day i have realized they are significantly too big. they stretch as you wear them so they ended up completely saggy in the butt and hanging around my hip bones. i was in the store today and tried on a pair in 26 regular and those were also too big; i didn't have time to try"
2831	1	a	"I ordered this in my usual retailer size, xspetite and it was too baggy in the bust. granted, i'm only a 34aa, but i would still expect it to be a little smaller in the bust at that size. the elastic waist was a little loose too (i have a 26"" waist, 34"" hips) and the inner slip showed a tiny bit like another reviewer said but it's the same fabric as the dress. the slip is adjustable but it's attached to the dress at the waist. it wasn't flattering on me in the hips either. this was a miss for me b"
2832	4	a	"At 4""11 i usually have to order items in petite and sometimes still have trouble fitting properly into items but i was able to buy this sweater in an xs! i figured with the high front and low back i wouldn't be able to fit it but it looks great on. not only is the fit amazing, but it feels amazing as well. it's such an easy wear and the high/low look is effortlessly chic!"
2833	1	a	This is a beautiful dress! the photos do not do it justice - the pink is gorgeous! it's also very comfortable but runs large. i'm usually a 6 or an 8 but purchased a 4.
2834	0	a	"I'd say these are exactly as-pictured and i'm happy with them. they run a little big in the waist; i most often wear xspetite in retailer sizes, and can often wear xs regular but these are a bit loose (i have a 26"" waist, 34"" hips). the drawstring tie solves that of course but it's only in the front, it doesn't go all the way around the waist, the rest is elastic. i'd also say these are high-rise, or long in the crotch (but i'm only 5'3"" so they're probably mid-rise on tall people). i have them hi"
2835	2	a	"I am 5'2"", 110 lbs and i ordered my usual size xs and they fit perfectly. they are so soft and comfortable and keep me very warm. i can't wait to take them with me when we go to the snow next month!"
2836	0	a	What a great, easy to wear jumpsuit! i love that the sleeves are a relaxed fit...sometimes they make these jumpsuits so unforgiving who wants to wrangle your way in and out? anyway i totally agree with the other reviewers that this is very stylish, comfortable and it looks amazing on.
2837	0	a	"I love this jumpsuit! i ordered it unsure, but i am so glad i did! it is super comfy and fit perfectly. i loved the length...can dress up or down. it is super flattering as well as i am curvy on the bottom and was told i looked ""trim"". my mom, friends, and complete strangers complimented me when i wore this...and that's when you know you scored."
2838	4	a	"This top is super soft cotton, with raw edges on the sleeves and hem. i bought the green top, which is a medium, faded olive color. despite the picture, this top is shortish in the front and on the sides, which are slit. the top is also very, very boxy. it's wide across, and doesn't ""fit"" the body at all. the sleeves are a slimmer fit, which contrasts nicely with the wide body. the picture is very deceptive. that said, this top is perfect for early fall/ late summer. super comfy. floaty. i wear"
2839	4	a	"This is a beautiful blouse but needs to be returned for size. i have lost a bit of weight; the last couple of blouses i have gotten in a m (including this one) have been to large for me. i am 5'5"" tall, 138 lbs and in this blouse need a s. the fabric is satiny and substantial with a gorgeous lining edged in contrasting thread., it hits at the top of my thigh in a regular size 8 but i should have ordered a 6. i would say to size down if you are close to being between sizes. the colors are as show"
2840	0	a	"Just so i'm clear, the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion, but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online, it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it ""gaps"" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.  also b/c i'm 5'8, the small was just a tad too short, definitely no bending !  i'm 5'8 tall, 127lbs with an average size chest #34c# i ordered a small and the bottom"
2841	1	a	Overall: a super comfy dress that you can wear anywhere. short, petite ladies beware though; the dress does not hang at your natural waist like it shows in the model's photos. in order for me to have it sit at my waist, the dress was folded over and did not flatter.
2842	4	a	My daughter tried this on in the store yesterday and loved it. it fits perfectly; true to size - the quality of the fabric and style is lovely. a fun jacket to layer with.
2843	4	a	I love everything bordeaux so when i saw this one i knew i needed to try it and it's my favorite top from this brand ever. i hope they keep the style and offer it in all of the colors going forward. it's a very flattering style for anyone - accentuates shape without being tight or clingy and the stripes are lovely. also the material is so soft. i have not washed it yet so i hope it stands up to wash and wear well. overall this is an amazing top. it runs slightly large. i'm usually an xs in tops
2844	4	a	"I bought this tunic today because it paired well with patterned slim pants. at 5'2"" the tunic felt like it added height and even though i'm a 34f the top fit well across the bust. i tried on the large first, and it felt very comfortable but a bit big. the medium fit a little more snugly, but was more proportional in the arms, so i purchased it instead. the neckline is not too low and does not require a camisole under and the buttons add a nice weight so that the top drapes towards my chest inst"
2845	1	a	I wore this dress to dinner right after my boyfriend proposed to me! it will be perfect to wear to any bridal event like a bridal shower, rehearsal dinner or engagement party. i ordered a size 0 and 2. the mock neck is a bit snug. there wasn't any difference really between a size 0 or 2 so i kept the size 0 since it fit better in the waist. it's beautifully made and feels like it will hold up well. it's casual but still interesting. it felt just a bit above my knees. a perfect length. i paired i
2846	4	a	This is going to be my go-to winter sweater for work! this piece is super comfy, yet a bit more dressy than just a regular sweatshirt. it will be an especially great layer for the ups and downs of the office thermostat.
2847	0	a	Super flattering and lovely material. dress-up or down. they run true to size.
2848	1	a	
2849	4	a	This top is beautiful. so beautiful that i am keeping it even though it is a little bit large and drapey. the fabric has a golden glow to it. the details in the back are darling. perfect for a romantic dinner out.
2850	0	a	The blue on this jumpsuit is actually a little darker than pictured. it's very cute on but i would order a size down for a more fitted look. my usual 0 petite had some extra fabric that layed awkwardly on my body.
2851	0	a	Tried this soft yummy jumpsuit on and loved the flow and softness of the fabric ...... will be able to wear into the fall with oversized sweater or wrap. just love
2852	1	a	I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline, so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale, but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves. they were right! the way it's seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that it's incredibly flattering. the fabric is light enough for warm weather, though it may be too heavy for hot weather. it's soft and has a very flattering n
2853	1	a	As other reviewers have said, this is the perfect summer maxi dress! i'm tall, just under 6 feet, and while the dress could be just a bit longer it still works for my height. i do wish the skirt was lined, but other than that the dress is excellent. worth buying at full price if you're worried about it selling out!
2854	0	a	Great fabric, not too clingy and provides a forgiving sillhoette. very comfortable. perfect skirt for summer get togethers or shopping. may be a little long if you are on the short side. one thing i liked is that the skirt draped well and doesn't hang open or slide up. recommend particularly on sale.
2855	4	a	I ordered this pullover in green, size large. the color is lovely and the fabric feels great. however, it was tight (even though i often wear a medium). unfortunately it will be going back.
2856	4	a	I have received so many compliments. it's my favorite
2857	0	a	These are beautiful pants, especially when you walk, they are simply beautiful and flow nicely. however, they are soooo very long (i am 5 5 1/2) and even with a big wedge's i would have to get these altered. the waist seemed very small, i am a sz 12 (10 in some stores) and i got the large and it was way too tight in the waist and have no stretch or give at all. . probably a sz 10 at most. so unfortunetly they have to go back.
2858	0	a	My only problem with the skirt was the length - it appears shorter in the pictures, and i can't take it up since it would mess up the front slit. i would have returned for the petite, but it was not available in the green color which i loved. even though the length is longer than i usually wear, i get non-stop compliments on the skirt. and, it's very versatile.
2859	4	a	I wanted this top so bad i ordered one size up (only size left in navy) and it is a little big but i still love it. so fun, love the color.
2860	1	a	Such a beautiful pattern on a lovely fabric. soft to the touch and flows beautifully. i love the lacing and even the butterfly sleeves - which i'm usually not a fan or. i have a feeling i'm going to wear this to death once the weather warms up! my only complaint is the slip, which is a scratchy material that is also completely see through. it's also very short, at least for my comfort. i have a plain black slip i'll be using instead, which is fine with me as i bought the dress for the outer shel
2861	2	a	"Such a lovely, well constructed top. looks great on petite frames. free flowing but not too ""peasant-like."" the embroidery is gorgeous. while it is pricey, it is something you will wear for years as it is a timeless piece."
2862	4	a	Maternity like, and although the back is really cool, there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwear/pajama. returned.
2863	4	a	Such an adorable top. very flattering despite it's rather full style. just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large. i normally wear a small, sometimes medium. i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large! i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly.
2864	1	a	
2865	4	a	Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations. i didn't know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm. haven't worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items. i'm usually an extra-small but the xxs also fits. it's a great buy especially since it's on sale now.
2866	2	a	"I received these as a christmas gift. they are really cozy: warm, soft and super comfortable. however, they stretch out a lot, as there is no drawstring or elastic on the waist band. this leads them to poof out a lot and i have to keep pulling them up. this is fine for hanging out around the house, but not if you want to wear them out and about. i'm keeping them because they're so comfortable, but beware how much they stretch. (i am 5'6"", 130 lbs and the size small fits well)."
2867	5	a	I saw this online yesterday and i was in the store today to try it on. i assumed it would look average or below average on me and i could just walk away no problem. by no means am i in the financial bracket to be spending this much money on a jumpsuit, yet here i am at home wearing it as i write this review. it is surprisingly flattering. i am 5 feet tall and have a petite frame so wide leg pants never work on me, but this somehow did without making me look bulky. given my height, it comes to ab
2868	2	a	It runs large but thats okay, its great quality and super super soft! i love the way it makes you feel so comfortable. very disappointed the clip fell off.
2869	4	a	Great quality- this sweater runs small and not as long as pictured in the catalogue. it's perfect over a longer undergarment underneath or over a sleeveless dress. i love the color & quality. i ordered on line & decided to keep it, yet wear it differently than i originally thought.
2870	3	a	This vest is much silkier than the pictures online show, which was a great surprise. the cut of this vest is beautiful and it can be worn so many ways!
2871	2	a	This robe is one of the best purchases i have made in the past year. i would also add that it is much cuter in person than pictured on the model. usually things look better on the models, but not this one. i have a tough time finding robes and sleepwear in petite sizes (thank you, retailer!). this robe is sooooo soft and cuddly, without being too heavy. the teal color is so pretty and the hemstitch detail is nice. i hate taking this off in the morning to get dressed.
2872	0	a	I loved this but couldn't believe how small it was.
2873	4	a	
2874	1	a	This dress is beautiful and so striking in it's unique design. i ordered a 4, as that is what i usually wear. about halfway up my body i knew it was not even going to zip! i did not even try. i love the fabric and colors so much though that i am going to try a 6. here's hoping it works!
2875	2	a	"Love this jumpsuit, i was rather apprehensive as i didn't think it would look as good on me as on the model but i am totally smitten with it. very flattering, especially if you have some bumps and rolls. i ordered in a medium (5.7 and 145 lbs and it fits perfectly. definitely recommend to order down.  as i'm wearing it to yoga i wear a sports bra underneath, that also helps with the very deep and open back to cover up a bit more. highly recommend, the top hits in all the right spots to make one"
2876	4	a	I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful, the embroidery is well done, the fabric is soft, and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath, but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.
2877	1	a	I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful, both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees, not like shown in the picture here. on that note, i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.
2878	2	a	I am a true to size 4 and when this bathing suit arrived it looks like it's a kids 4. i will exchange for an 8 and hope for the best. the quality looks great and the styling is beautiful but i could barely get into the suit.
2879	4	a	
2880	4	a	Must wear tank under or i feel immodest due to eyelet holes. beautiful. i'm machine washing w delicates n hang dry. comes out great. easy breezy.
2881	4	a	Fits and lots nothing like picture. very wide like a tent dress!
2882	4	a	Yes, this top runs large and it doesn't show your curves, but it's still really cute and fun to wear. i first purchased the beautiful sage color, and after getting compliments, i also ordered the navy version. these tops are easy to wear, have an interesting detail at the neck, and could be layered. cozy, comfortable, stylish. love mine!
2883	5	a	"I tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific. it's very light-weight fabric but isn't see-through. the colors are medium in depth, not too bright. if you typically wear ""cool"" colors and avoid browns, you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted. there's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in. i'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs, so there's simply too much fabric in the dress. i would have bought a petite. the tag says it's avai"
2884	0	a	This skirt is great! the fabric is so soft and light. i was hoping that the lower portion of the skirt wouldn't be too transparent, and it wasn't. the slip lining on the upper portion of the skirt is nice. the color is exactly as shown. i followed the advice of the only reviewer and sized up... i shouldn't have! the skirt was too big in the waist and too long. so i exchanged and the fit was right on. i think the skirt is meant to sit a little higher on the waist, so keep that in mind. the only t
2885	3	a	I was lucky enough to see this in store when it went on sale and although i rarely wear leather/vegan jackets i tried it on. i am torn on sizing i'm normally a m or 8/10 in retailer but the m fit slightly tight in the waist and the l was slightly loose. i ended up with the l in the moss color, since i can layer and don't really want the jacket too cropped. i also saw the brown and tried that on but for me the moss color was much richer.
2886	4	a	I really wanted to like this shirt but it doesn't seem to be of that great of quality and is much more sheer than indicated in the photographs. the shirt is very clingy and doesn't hang well. i sent it back
2887	4	a	I love cashmere, love the length, cowl-neck and colors, however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person, which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price.
2888	0	a	And this one has a heavenly feel to it. i know it's not 100% cashmere, but it's soft and cozy. i love the understated colors and plan to wear it with a neutral/creme sweater. perfect to take from fall into winter.
2889	2	a	I just bought the grey, and now i'm coming back for the black and cream i lovethis staple item!! so soft fits great!
2890	4	a	My heart's a-flutter for this top. the fabric has an excellent weight and feel to it, and the little, fluttery cap sleeves are to die for. i've ordered this in almost every color because it is such a great staple. it is a gorgeous pairing with the marala knit skirt (especially in green,) and the double stripe jacquard skirt, but i'm certain it would be a perfect choice for any pencil skirt. it's so flattering and comfortable, with a neckline that is perfect for single strand pearls or similar le
2891	0	a	The length on these are great. they stretch but so far they don't stretch out. the material is a dark and soft. i am 5'6' and 135lbs. the size 26 fit great.
2892	0	a	Love the print, length, and cut. but the tie waist hangs in a weird way and seemed like it would stretch out and sag after a while. sad to return it.
2893	4	a	Love this henely, the lace-up is cute. the shirt is comfy. so versatile. beach coverup or over jeans
2894	1	a	I got this dress in navy for my engagement photos and i got so many compliments on the design and fit of the dress. it's very comfortable and stretchy so i got a 6 petite and it fit perfectly, where normally i need an 8 or a 10 because clothes are made so tight now. it was light weight and fit great in the bust and fell nicely over the hips. and for the bottom of the dress being white, it surprisingly wasn't see through. i wouldn't go wearing bright red under the dress but there is definitely no
2895	1	a	I love the dress as shown in the photo. thankfully i had a chance to see the dress in the store. it is sheer. can see thru it. can not wear this to work.
2896	1	a	I really wanted to love this dress. the pattern is so much prettier in person. i typically wear a medium, sometimes a large in tops. the medium in this dress was too tight in my chest; the large fit my chest but was ridiculously large in other areas. the front of the dress goes up pretty high (for someone with a large chest) and flows down. there is a tie in the back but it doesn't do much to help with the shape in the front.
2897	4	a	This top runs large... an entire size. i am on the fence about it.. it is quite *stylish* and well made. it is fairly heavy and seems like it would be very warm. the burgundy color is nice. the issue i am having with it is the way the lower black arms are sewn in the upper arms. it just seems somewhat *odd*. overall though, it is very *forgiving*,especially with the black border around the entire bottom. it is the perfect top to showcase a great long necklace and it would be great with leggings
2898	4	a	I wish they would have shown this belted as it is beyond striking if you slip you belt thru the top of the slit.under the fabric and bring thru the front belting only the front leaving the back full...stunning and chic! because of the colors this will be incredible in the fall...i plan to wear with all my on trend overalls and booties...madly in love with it. i am certain if all these 1 star reviwes played with it in the fashion they too would have given 5 stars. the knit is beautiful and again
2899	4	a	Received a lot of compliments when i wore this sweater. quality is wonderful. only thing i noticed is that it's a little shorter in length then what i was expecting.
2900	4	a	This shirt feels amazing. it also drapes nicely and is very feminine and flattering. great versatile piece.
2901	4	a	"I love this top. it was everything i hoped it would be. it is lined so it is not see through in the chest/back; sleeves are sheer. soft. gorgeous color. love the layers. runs large so definitely size down. i am usually a m and ordered the s. i'm 5'8"" curvy 32dd"
2902	1	a	"Tried this on in the store in a small (i'm a size 6 in most retailer dresses) and it was enormous. i'm short (5'2"") so i knew i'd need a petite size. ordered a petite small and the length is better - still a lot of fabric, but i think a petite xs would be too small if you are curvier up top (i'm a full 34d and the petite small is just slightly tight in the bust). definitely size down in this or you'll be swimming in it!"
2903	3	a	"I ordered the sapphire.............it is simply beautiful! love love love. superior hunter style and quality which never disappoints!"
2904	4	a	This top is just adorable! so comfy and cute. i love the cut and how it goes a little longer in the back. i will be wearing this a lot!
2905	0	a	So i was super excited to get this skirt, unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured, it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier, i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re
2906	4	a	I have a curvy figure, and this top is not for me. it fits loose at the top and is tight at the bottom. it is also short. i think this top works best on slender figures.
2907	2	a	Usually i'd wait for a sale on rayon loungewear but i would have gladly paid more if this was cotton or silk! despite the poor fabric, the design is light and beautiful with a high quality floral print that's distinctive and elegant. i can wear this with a thin strappy slip or a lacy cami bra or with a cardigan, jacket and lacy boy shorts. an retailer employee wore this chemise under a denim shirtdress and belted the whole outfit together--it was perfection. i purchased size m and my figure is 39-
2908	5	a	"This skirt is really adorable, but only if you're going to tuck in your tops. the pockets flare out at the top, so shirts don't lay correctly on them. instead the bottom of the shirt floofs out and looks really dumpy. tucked in though, super cute!  the waist is really tiny and the fabric has no stretch to speak of. i usually take a 0/2 pant or 25/26 jean. i ordered the xsmall and could only get the top fastened by really sucking it in and struggling. i'll be exchanging for a small, hopefully t"
2909	1	a	I bought this dress for a cruise i'm going on in january. it's so light and comfortable. i'm 5'10 and the length is perfect. it will look really cute with a jean jacket and some booties. great price for this dress! you can't pass this up!!
2910	4	a	
2911	1	a	"I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5'5"", 120 lbs, straight figure, very tiny ""girls"") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the ""swin"
2912	1	a	On the hanger, this dress looks a bit boxy, however once on, it has a beautiful flow and elegance to it. it's super feminine and cinches in at the waist perfectly. my one (major) complaint that prevented me from purchasing the dress? there's no give to the dress. i wasn't able to lift my arms up past 90 degrees and that's sort of a problem. it's a shame though because the outside shell is gorgeous and so structured, and it would have been a nice contrast to the shape of the dress on a body.
2913	4	a	"This is a beautiful quality knit. i do wish that it was a tad bit longer...i'm 5'7"" with a long torso and found it to hit like the model shot. since the sweater flares a little at the bottom, i think it might be more flattering a little longer. keeping this regardless because it will still get plenty of wear."
2914	0	a	This skirt was placed next to the gallery skirt (corduroy skirt) and i thought it was the same until i touched the fabric and realized it was denim. the material is not the average stiff jean type but much thinner cotton material. i am surprised that this skirt is now released because i feel that it should have belonged to the summer collection. i think it is a nice basic casual skirt if you need one. kudos for the unique buttons, the first button is decorative which stands out from the rest of
2915	1	a	"Too thin at bottom where lace is.  couldn't sit in the dress without worrying i was ""hanging out"""
2916	4	a	I'm not much for ponchos, but this one looked unique. it is thin, kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online,, and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.
2917	4	a	Relaxed fit, soft and comfortable. interesting design but material is extremely thin. if i had purchased this at full price, i probably would have returned it. it seems more like a pajama top...
2918	4	a	"This top is very cute and appears in person just as it does in the picture. fits true to size and the item is made well. i had many complements and it was fun to wear!  unfortunately, i did have to iron it right out of the bag."
2919	1	a	If you're on the fence about this dress - go for it! i am a huge retailer shopper but haven't ever been compelled to write a review until now.  this dress fits beautifully.  the materials is so soft and comfortable and the design of the dress is very flattering, with or without a belt.  i am 5'2, 118 pounds and i purchased the pxs. it's perfect!  i wore this with booties and received a ton of compliments. the fringe and hemline make this dress really stand out.
2920	4	a	"I really like this top. bought it in ""purple"" but i would not call it that. it is more maroon or burgundy. color is exactly what it shows in the online photo. really like the green also. crocheted arms are super. i found it ran slightly small, so if you are between sizes, order up. one slight personal problem for me is that there is cashmere in it and i live in florida. even though we do get cooler weather here, i am not sure i will have that much chance to wear it; it will be too warm for me. t"
2921	1	a	"I was so happy to see this dress at one of my local retailer stores since i've had this in my basket since i first saw it, i tried it on in my usual size and it runs true to size in all areas. the length is as shown int he picture, i am 5'4"" and it hit me right above the knee. i am short waisted and the dress fit perfect, sat right above my waist and then lay just as shown. not too much material to make you look fuller in the hips, and also not too young looking. i am planning to wear it to"
2922	5	a	This dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it. i love absolutely anything with a full shape, and this dress has it! its cut like a circle...so ladies this dress has a lot of fabric. i'm 5'8 and wouldn't be able to wear it as a dress, but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings. the arms are a tad more fitted (though i have larger arms) which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine. if you love a cool quirky piece, this one is a winner!
2923	1	a	"Lovely dress ,comfortable fabric and great cut . the combination of the alignment of stripes works beautifully and is very figure flattering. versatile to keep casual or dress up with a great pair of shoes."
2924	1	a	"I absolutely love this dress! it hugs your body without being clingy - very flattering. the fabric is so soft. i am 5'7"" - 120 lbs - and i usually take an xs or s - i got a m in this dress because of the style and fit and it was perfect."
2925	3	a	I ordered ths thinking it was likea blazer, but it is soft and not structured, like a t-shirt. however, it is rather flattering on. i had a har dtime deciding whether to keep it. the regular size was fine on me, i usually require peites, but this doesn't come in petites, and it was really nice with the fitted cowl shirt i was wearing. i am definitely putting it back in my wish list (as i did end up returning).
2926	1	a	This dress is extremely comfortable and the material is very soft. i was worried it would be too clingy but it hangs nicely. the length is just right, although the pockets hit below my hips. i was a little unsure of the bold pattern but i liked it better in person. i bought it to wear on an upcoming beach vacation but now i plan to pair it with flats and sweaters for the fall.
2927	4	a	"I love this style. reminds me of what we used to wear back in the 70's. it's very cute, flattering, and material is a high quality. will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans. if you like this ""baby doll"" style, you'll love this."
2928	0	a	"I purchased for my daughter who is mid 30's and she loved the romper. i'm going to list her size since that is appropriate for who is wearing the item."
2929	4	a	I have many left of center tees, and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color), which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long, the cotton is thick, and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite 5 stars for me, though, because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me, though.
2930	4	a	It's very beautifully designed, simple but elegant. material is thick and soft so it makes good shape. color is a little different from picture but it didn't disappoint me because everything else is so good.
2931	0	a	"There wasn't much question as to whether or not i'd love these pants, as i have several pairs of the pilcro ""hyphen"" pant; however, this one is slightly different (front pocket's and seam down front), and though they are slightly different, the fit and cut are the same. these pants are a great weight--can wear year round, really--but these will be my ""go to"" pants this fall and winter. the length is nice--can wear with shoes or rolled up with boots, too--""utility"" chinos? yes!  the fit is nicely"
2932	4	a	"I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm, no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b, weigh 110 pounds, 5'3"" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!"
2933	4	a	"This pink tank is a wonderful addition to my go-to basics. i love the color, which is a nice deep pink that is pretty spot on in terms of accuracy to the online photo. it is a wonderful comfy fabric and the side knot adds nice visual interest to make this top appealing and unique. i also appreciate the wide straps, which means i can wear a normal bra instead of a strapless one without worrying about straps playing peek-a-boo. the only drawback is size. i ordered my usual xs (i am 5'5"", 110 lbs,"
2934	4	a	I love this cardigan! i ordered the pink and it's a really pretty color. i wish it didn't run so big but xs will be cozy all winter.
2935	4	a	"I saw this shirt online, loved it, but unfortunately it was sold out in the regular size small. however, retailer shirts tend to be long on me, so i ordered a petite small. it fits great! i am actually happy i got a petite because i feel a regular would have been too long. the shirt comes to my hips. for reference i'm 5'8"" 145 lbs. and my measurements are 34-27-38."
2936	1	a	Gorgeous laser cut top layer in a true vermillion red, oh la la! style is feminine, elegant, and appropriate for all ages.  i plan on wearing this for the upcoming holiday season as well as valentine's day 2017!  quality is top notch and fit is true to size all be it a little snug in the sleeves.  for reference i'm 34e-30-40 and the size 8 worked, i would have like to have tried the 10 but the store only had an 8.  the arms are a little snug, nothing uncomfortable, just snug. length is below kne
2937	4	a	Three tops for the price of one.....i fell in love with this top the moment i saw it online. i tried it on as soon as i received it with jeans and it looked just how i hoped it would. not too short, just right. then i tried it on with the buttons in front and just loved how it looked. this can be worn 3 ways......back buttoned, front buttoned and as an unbuttoned throw on over a tank and shorts. recommend this highly for just about any body type..
2938	4	a	I usually wear xl in tops at retailer, but i picked this one up in a l. it's stretchy and super soft, but doesn't breathe all that well.
2939	4	a	I typically wear a medium, but went with a large because i am pregnant and tall. i think i could have used the medium in width, but like the length of the large. it is a wider fit and is significantly shorter in the front than the back, but i think works with the look of the top. i think you could dress it up or down and the fabric is cozy. i would highlight that it has a wider fit, but i think that is the design of the top. overall, i am pleased and i think meets my search for an off the should
2940	4	a	This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really doesn't do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it's a stunner!
2941	1	a	I love this dress.i have it in black and am about to buy it in the blue..i'm usually a 4 but i bought a size 2. it is light and flattering with the gathering above the waist....does tend to crease a bit, but it's not too bad. love the way it can be dressed up or down (think boots or vans or sandles). i will dress it up to go out, but also throw it on to pick the kids up from school.
2942	1	a	This is a lovely dress, but much more casual than i thought from the picture. the material is very thin and casual. i needed a dressier dress, and i didn't need another casual dress, so i sent it back, but it would be fine if you want something casual.
2943	4	a	This vest is the best!! even though it has no sleeves it truly keeps you warm. it feels like you're wearing a soft blanket around you. it is my favorite!
2944	4	a	"Lets discuss the neckline: it's fabulous! furthermore, this sweater can go anywhere, it's dress up, dress down.  feeling low? this girl will lift you up and take you to town."
2945	4	a	
2946	1	a	Ordered a few things for a last minute decision on what to wear to a wedding - i slipped this on right out of the box and decision was made! tunic style is great for all body types and hides any bulges. crochet neckline and sleeves are cute and a little sexy. dress is very comfortable and not too short. wore this with pearls and ankle-strap pumps for a dressier look. very happy with this one!
2947	4	a	I purchased this shirt in grey. i loved the color and the details, especially the lace on the shoulders. i just found the fit to be off for me. the style certainly calls for a relaxed fit but the small was loose in an unflattering way. had the xs been available i might have considered exchanging for an xs but the s was already a bit short on me. (strange because although i am not petite, i am fairly short wasted.) i also wasn't in love with the neckline. i will continue my search for a weekend-w
2948	0	a	I cannot say enough about these chinos. i hope retailer will keep them around for a long time despite the news that says retailer is going the way of jcrew. these pants are more stylish and comfortable than any other chinos i have owned. i am a teacher and being comfortable and stylish at the same time is important. i am a 10 to 12 and a 30 fits me fine. please please retailer keep making these every season in fun colors!!!
2949	0	a	"I bought this in the pattern in a size medium. i am a size 4-6 (38"" around the hips/butt). the small fit but felt very clingy to my curves. the medium gave me a little more wiggle room and didn't outline every curve of my butt. the material is very soft and comfortable, but it didn't feel thin or cheap or see-through. it has a nice weight to it. i am tall (almost 5' 9"") and it fit me just as it appears in the picture."
2950	1	a	I am 5'3, 120 lbs and i got xs petite. it fits beautifully and hits me a couple inches above my ankle bone. as stated in my review title, the material is quite heavy and great quality, which helps it hang nicely. cut high enough under the armholes and snug enough under the arms and across the top of my chest so the fullness at the bottom is proportional. love it with my lace-up espadrilles!
2951	1	a	I was so excited to see this yellow dress online but was disappointed with the color when it arrived. the yellow us much darker than pictured. i felt the dress ran true to size but if you're short you definitely want to go with petite sizes.
2952	0	a	"I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived, i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been. problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then). problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other"
2953	0	a	"I bought these to go with the boiled wool jacket that is also currently on sale. i have several pairs of charlie trousers, and i really like the brand. these are in a thicker ""winter fabric"" and i understand why the other reviews found them itchy. i don't find that bothersome, but the texture is a bit different. the quality is typical for charlies. the color stripe is a metallic bronze, but could look pink in the right light. the fabric is noticeably stretchy--i think without that stretch, these"
2954	0	a	This is the first romper i have have purchased and is so cute! i am in between a small and a medium usually (5'7, 135 lbs and athletic). the medium fit okay, but with some extra fabric--the small fit better and was much more flattering. the romper feel well-made. can't wait to wear it!
2955	4	a	I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.
2956	4	a	I was looking for long vest to go with skinny jeans. this is exactly what i was looking for. the color is better than the pic to me. the style is flattering.. the size is just right. can't wait to wear it. i strongly recommend it.
2957	1	a	This dress will be perfect for the mid-september wedding i'm attending. september is a transitional month fashion-wise and this knit dress will be perfect. the shimmer (which isn't apparent from the website) makes it festive enough for a wedding.
2958	1	a	This dress is incredible soft and flattering. it sits higher on the waist than most other dresses i've received from retailer, which is actually great for me, as i have a short torso. i have been able to put it in with the regular wash cycle, which was a pleasant surprise. the only issue was with the overlapping fabric on the top; i ended up adding an extra stitch to avoid being totally exposed.
2959	0	a	"I ordered this skirt in my usual xs. when it arrived it looked tiny. the xs was almost impossible to get on. i ended up returning the xs for a medium, which fit perfectly (and is work appropriate). my measurements are 5'6"" and 125. my recommendation would size up two sizes."
2960	1	a	If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also, i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons, as several were off some of the dresses.
2961	4	a	Just love sweatshirts & ponchos, so what an unusual twist of style! ordered my usual size s during the promo. looks pretty much as in the pic. oversized arm openings are created by a string attached to the sides of the garment. it's ok but may eventually break off. maybe i'll secure w/ snaps or just sew it on by hand. wore it yesterday w/ just a tank underneath to lounge around. later wore for casual dining. it turned cooler & changed to a grey t-shirt underneath along w/ dark blue denim skinnys
2962	4	a	The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern. a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering. very happy with this purchase. i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish.
2963	1	a	"As other reviews noted, this runs large--huge is more like it. it's great quality, but i'm wondering now if the s/m would take me through the third trimester of pregnancy (which is why i ordered a m/l). i'm 5'7"", and if i were any less, i don't think this would work for me at all."
2964	1	a	This is my third byron lars and as usual it is absolutely gorgeous and so worth the price. it completely flatters the body and all the details add so much interest, creating a very unique dress.
2965	4	a	Very comfy and light. can be casual with jeans and boots or dress it up with a nice necklace and pencil skirt.
2966	0	a	Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper, trouser-like pant--this is not it!
2967	3	a	"This sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life, but the inside is so scratchy. i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper. unlined and uncomfortable. no thank you!  should you choose to proceed, i found the fit tts. i'm 5'8, wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me."
2968	4	a	For a couple weeks, i debated making this purchase. in fear that my size would no longer be available, i ordered this lovely top. when it arrived, i was immediately disappointed with its colors...unlike the vibrant colors in the photo, the top's colors were dull...more a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender. had the fit been better, i would have kept this item despite of its color. it's cut weird! though it runs slightly large, i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and
2969	0	a	"I just recently purchased this skirt and i love it! it's cotton with spandex incorporated, so it's soft and not stiff. it hugs your waist and accentuates your butt nicely. the lace up is unique in design, so it can be dressed up with a sparkle blouse or dressed casual in a t-shirt. i'm 5' 1"" in height so the length is very flattering and it zips up in the back. great color cream and excellent quality."
2970	5	a	The top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy.  it also feels cheap to the touch.  i love the idea but can't keep it for this price...i'm a shorty so i'd have to hem it too! sadly will return.
2971	4	a	I am so pleased with this product. it is a great staple for every woman. my one complaint is that it easily pulls.. something to be mindful of when handling the garment.
2972	0	a	I love this skirt. it is stylish and very comfortable. ladies, don't be afraid of wearing a pattern on the bottom. it is flattering and slimming. i wear it with a black wrap sweater or black cotton casual jacket.
2973	4	a	I bought the holly color which appears almost granite/slate color in natural light. overall, great transitional sweater piece for fall. i'm considering exchanging it for an xs since the s seems a bit large. comfy/cozy yet breathable.
2974	4	a	The simplicity of this t-shirt will go with jeans, shorts, or anything casual. the macrame and bead details give it that extra style. i bought the red and white, and love them both. the red is warm and bright, with pink undertones. despite the boxiness of the fit, it ran true to size for me. i did not think it was too big; its meant to be loose and slouchy rather than fitted.
2975	4	a	I love this top. i bought it in the blue but loved all the colors. i fell in love with it on-line and hesitated ordering it only because i was afraid that the arm holes would be too large (based on what i saw in the picture). fortunately they had it at my local retailer, so i was able to try it on. my usual xs fit perfectly. great flow, soft and casual. perfect for those cool nights in the summer or layered with a cardigan in the winter.
2976	1	a	This dress is everything i love about retailer. a never-could-have-guessed-it, feminine, textured twist on a classic. it's beautiful, it's comfortable. the cut is true to size (for me) and figure flattering.
2977	4	a	I ordered the green version in size xl. i knew it was cropped and it fits me as shown on the models. so, i think that's true to size. the knit is very soft. but, it's the color that's amazing--such a rich bright emerald green! i love the look of it. it's awkward fitting on my pear-shape. i layer a long tank underneath with this on top. but, the hemline of the sweater cuts at an unflattering place. still, the softness and the beautiful color make it a staple in my closet. when i'm staying at home
2978	4	a	I purchased this sweater in grey to take on a fall european trip. it is very pretty without being overly frilly. a marled heather grey color. soft and warm without being too bulky. light enough to wear in the daytime but with enough coverage to transition into a cool evening. casual enough to wear over a tee or blouse with jeans yet sleek enough to pair with a skirt or dress. it is a roomy fit without being sloppy. i like things a bit loose and comfy - not too tight and am happy with the medium
2979	4	a	This is online exclusive so i ordered both sizes xs and s. it runs pretty large so i kept size xs. the material can be stretched. but i like the feeling of it and very comfortable to your skin. i am so happy receiving so many compliments wherever i go!!!
2980	0	a	I loved almost everything about this skirt. thick and lined and love the buttons. comfortable. the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom, presumably from the buttons. i was torn, but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back.
2981	4	a	I purchased this tee last week in white and love it! as soon as i saw that it was on sale i ran to get a price adjustment and to pick up a few more colors! i had every intention to grab up the blue today however i tried on four larges and all were cut way shorter than the other colors. i ended up purchasing the red which fits exactly as my white one does. perfect light weight, easy, but adorable tee for summer!
2982	1	a	I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined, baggy, cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!
2983	4	a	This top runs large for sure and reminds me more of a tunic due to the length. nice detailing around neck and sleeves and the paisley print on the side hems is super cute. size down!
2984	3	a	"-like others, i agree that this is a staple that will pair with many, many outfits. it is really well-constructed, classic, comfortable, and a wonderful length for us taller gals. as you can see from my stats, i'm rather tall at 5'9"", so it's hard to find"
2985	1	a	Simple, classic, figure flattering, and reasonably priced!
2986	0	a	I followed the other reviewers who said these fit true to size. i have to disagree. i normally wear an 8 in shorts, which is what i ordered, and the fit is too tight in the waist and butt. i'm exchanging for 10. i really like the color and fun accents. i really hope i can get these in 10!
2987	4	a	Adorable sweater with a loose knit that helps slim down my man-back appearance. cut is tapered to the body but with a soft flare at the bottom hem. not clingy, very soft fabric doesn't accentuate bulges so i am happy about it's forgiving silhouette.
2988	5	a	"It is seldom that i write a review about a tee, but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today, i just felt compelled to do so! the deal is, this tee is pricey for sure, but in my opinion, it is worth it! as another reviewer said, the cotton fabric is hefty; in fact, it could also be called a ""lightweight sweater."" everything about this tee is perfect and classic: the elbow sleeves, the nice neckline, and the semi-boxy, semi-cropped fit. it will go with everything from jeans, to nice slacks"
2989	0	a	"Whoa! these are very high-waisted. but i think i like it! this is a very 70s style with the high waist and wide legs. the brown motif is kinda funky! i am a 70s/vintage lover though, so i was pleasantly surprised. the tall length is more than adequately long for my 6'2"" frame. i may need to take them up a little bit, in fact."
2990	1	a	Looks great, the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!
2991	5	a	"I love his cardigan! i knew the small would be a little big since i am normally an xs or xxs. i decided to give it a try anyway. it's definitely a little big - i would have liked an xs to be an option (5'3"" and 110lbs, for reference). i'm keeping it because it still looks cute, just a little loose through the body."
2992	4	a	Its a pleasure to wear this sweater! it feels like you are wearing a hug! it's that cozy! yet, it's almost weightless, which is nice for me because i get overheated easily. the only slight downfall is that it is dry clean only. i got this in charcoal but both color options are so pretty and you will be pleased how dressed up and flattering they look without giving up comfort!
2993	2	a	"High quality fabric and lots of bottom/ back coverage. also, it did not cut into my hips (which is fabulous!) ...so, if you're looking for a little more coverage this is your bottom. i found it true to size...i'm 5'8"" and 150 lbs and i got a size 8 :)"
2994	0	a	"My first review and first full price designer denim purchase....  i recently lost weight and in need to replace all my pants and in search of a dark wash high rise jeans (preferably in black), finally decided to buy this at full price online coz of all the fab reviews. i decided to purchase the 25p, thinking that i may return after receiving it in the mail since i wasn't able to try at the store and not sure if i got the right size, also it's not the high rise denim that i was looking for. but t"
2995	4	a	I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua, but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it's pretty boxy and it's hard to tell from the photo, but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it), but that's based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size, but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide).
2996	4	a	I ordered this in black and in the print and i am super happy with both. the fabric is very soft. i've worn it with denim and khaki shorts as well as with a cute skirt for work. very versatile.
2997	4	a	I bought this top for work and going out.  it is a beautiful top that goes with many items in my closet like my red blazer, grey blazer, red cardigan etc.  it is very flattering.  the arm holes weren't too big.  fit tts.
2998	4	a	Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.
2999	4	a	I bought this top to wear this fall, and it does not disappoint. it's a heavier light knit and the pattern is subtle but really pretty. i ordered a size smaller than i usually wear so that i can wear it on or off the shoulder, making this great for work.
3000	0	a	I really liked these jeans. i had to return though. they run small. i normally wear a 27 and could have gone for a 28 in these. maybe it was because i went for the petite. they can run a bit smaller.
3001	2	a	"I managed to find this huit eden lagoon fixed straps foam bandeau swimsuit in a size 32c and it fits perfectly. my current measurements are 33-25-37 or 38 hips, and i normally wear a 30d or 32c bra. . i have a longish torso, yet this doesn't ride up. fits like on the model. there is a thin strip of silicone around the back to keep it from sliding down. the v-shape is held by a hard wire, but it doesn't cut in anywhere. the soft black straps are sewn in and not adjustable but do hold their shap"
3002	4	a	"This is absolutely adorable and so flattering! i have the patterned shirt, and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much. i am 5 ft. 9"" and 155 lbs. and the medium fits nicely. hope this helps!"
3003	1	a	"I am a fan of these designers and their gorgeous fabrics - most of which are heavy brocades. this is so pretty and fun. the print is playful, and colors are gorgeous, and the fit is floaty but not too full or too tight. i love the bit of beading, and that i can dress it up or down.  i am petite and not usually a bigger print or long dress fan, but i know that i will wear this one for years.   i did get a 00 petite as i know that only this small size fits me at retailer - 0's swallow me. this i"
3004	0	a	"I love these pants, they are a great addition to my work wardrobe. the fit is very flattering, with the wide legs falling perfectly, and they are a great length. i got the red, which is a beautiful and brighter than the pics. the fabric is a nice weight, perfect for fl winters. i personally like the mid-rise as it helps with tucking in shirts that are on the shorter side. i highly recommend these pants as a nice alternative in color and cut for the office. i'm 5'7"" and 135lbs and i purchased the"
3005	4	a	This sweater is so unique. not for the faint of heart but it's beautiful. hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired. the colors are saturated, vibrant. love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back. the front material is slightly stiffer. i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i'm willing to overlook it. will be a great sweater for the holiday season. wear it with a skirt, jeans, skinny cargos. endless possibilities.
3006	3	a	"I'm 5'10"" and felt that it was just too short. otherwise - love it!"
3007	2	a	"These socks feel amazing-i have them in both colors.  you would be surprised at the softness of these socks, yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks. i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me. i feel like these would last a long time, with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spa-these socks are soft?  these socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li"
3008	4	a	This t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything. my only concern is the fabric is super light. not enough to be see through, but just enough to make me question the quality. i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though. the drape is nice and not super revealing; discreet enough for work. i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile.
3009	4	a	I ordered one size down and it's still plenty roomy. as others have said, the sleeves are a tighter fit, but there is a tiny bit of stretch to the fabric. i'm smaller busted and didn't want the v-neck to get too low, so i sized down one. very cute tucked into jeans or paired with leggings.
3010	4	a	Hi, this top is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. very feminine. it has a small amount of swing without a large amount of fabric. love it.
3011	2	a	I love this tank! basic but super sexy! i'm an a cub and this tee makes them look a lil bigger so i'll take it!! i bought the dark grey in small and went back for the striped grey and purchased small. i bought the black one too but i feel like the small in black is too big and the xsmall is too small. i'm torn because i want the black to tuck in a pencil skirt.
3012	0	a	Loved this jumper, i usually wear between a small and a medium in retailer (with jumpers it's mainly because of my hips and where the midline sits on my stomach), so thought this one would probably be a medium. but it was definitely baggy/lose. otherwise i would've totally kept it!
3013	4	a	
3014	1	a	This dress came with two pieces, a black sheath slip and a sheer pattern top-piece (pictured). it's pull-on and comfortable and flows well. i ordered online but wish i could have selected the pattern, as the fabric differs a little from front to back both in the pattern and intensity of color. overall though, a comfortable, light summer dress.
3015	4	a	"I love everything about this top. first, it's super flattering, especially if you have a tummy. i am small chested, and it makes me look a little chestier than i am. i tried on both the xs and s in the black (it's really a charcoal gray) but preferred the fit of the xs. note: i'm 5'8"" / 136 lbs and typically wear an xs or s in most retailer tops. the small seemed too drapey and the armholes were a tad big. my store didn't have the wine color or i would have purchased it too."
3016	4	a	"This is one of the best purchases f i have made at retailer recently. i got this in ivory in my usual xs. the pictures do not do it justice.  it has such a nice drape and i love the detail on the back.  looks great with black cropped trousers, as well as skinny jeans."
3017	4	a	I tried this on in the store. the embroidery is very nice and the shirt is very flattering. however, because of all the stitching, the shirt is a bit stiff on top. there is not much give. i am also concerned that after washing it, it will look terrible, so i passed.
3018	1	a	This dress might be the most comfortable article of clothing i own, especially for the hot summers. it is attractively loose, and so light that you barely feel like you are wearing it. love it!
3019	4	a	I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side, so the garment flows nicely, it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial, heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey, not whi
3020	4	a	Only worn this once but had multiple compliments! such a cute pattern and style. only complaint is wish they would have done the sides with a split. it kind of wants to hug the hips and then be too wide in the middle. still, love it!
3021	0	a	I paid full price for these gladly (the olive ones) and was delighted when i was able to purchase the black on sale. they are midweight, soft, flattering and stylish. they stretch a little (belt needed) but not much. pilcro are my go-to pants and these hit it out of the park. i wish they would come in a lighter weight version for warmer weather !
3022	4	a	"I tried this on in the sotre (in balck) as i was planning on ordering the orangey one.  my usual is 0 or 2, sometimes petites. i thought the regular 0 was sjut fine and flattering. fabric is soft, adn every pattern they ahd in store was really nice (no orange-red though). was not overly snug anywhere, and i am a bit braod for my size.  i deceided not to purchase only because i have done seriosu damage in the last month *multiple purcahses) and this was one of 2 i had to pick... if it goes on sal"
3023	4	a	I really love cloth & stone, and this top did not disappoint. i am usually a size small in tops but tend to be an xs in halters because the arm holes are usually big on me. i went with my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it has a nice drape to it and is super soft. i will add that when looking at the picture, i didn't notice that there is a muted pink to the plaid design. i originally thought it was just a navy blue and white plaid. however, there is a really light pink to it as well. i actually w
3024	1	a	"I was bummed about this dress! i saw it online and loved both colors. i tried it on in the store, and it did not work for me. i am 5'8"" tall with an hourglass figure, and it was too shot and too loose. it looked like a babydoll nightgown. i wanted to love it, but i think this one only works on smaller frames. onto the next..."
3025	2	a	I have these in grey and i love them! they are so comfy. i got them in m/l even though i am a s/m because i like the loose fit. they are very soft.
3026	4	a	This top is super versatile--i wear it with jeans on the weekend but it's also work appropriate. it's light and perfect for warm weather!
3027	1	a	The dress is beautiful in pictures, but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly, had to return.
3028	0	a	"I bought the skirt in green in size 6 (i am 5'4"" and 143 lbs). it fit very well and was very flattering and the length was perfect. i can see myself wearing it a lot this spring and in summer."
3029	4	a	"I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5"" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny."
3030	2	a	I bought these pants for my girlfriend for christmas. she really loved them! the material the pants are made of is very comfortable. the animals are super cute too.
3031	4	a	I ordered the orange color online and was very happy with the product when it arrived. it's a soft orange color, perfect for fall. the shirt is thin and probably will need a cami underneath, but it's longer in the back than the front and will go great with leggings or skinny jeans.
3032	4	a	It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
3033	4	a	I purchased this with some hesitation, having read that some people thought it was unflattering. but i couldn't resist the sale price, and i love a low-maintenance work top and doesn't require ironing. this fits the bill perfectly. it's made of high quality fabric, there's a soft inner lining with a side zip closure, and it has a pretty narrow profile so initially i found it a little snug to wiggle into (i got a small), but once on it fit perfectly, and is so flattering i can't imagine why other
3034	1	a	I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress, i'm dissapointed.
3035	1	a	The dress is very cute, probably more on the casual side. i ordered the 2 petite and it hits me a few inches above the knee, which is what i wanted. the material of the dress and under slip is a little thin, but it looked nice after i ironed it. the top part of the dress looks great and shows off my shoulders nicely.
3036	4	a	Seems like all i wear all summer are solid colored tees with shorts or skirts. decided this summer i would have patterns! and color! this is a great t-shirt. nice weight. pretty pattern. i found the length on the small to fit my frame perfectly. an xs probably would be good too, but i hate having my favorite t-shirts shrink to unwearable so i always start a little bigger.
3037	1	a	"I am 5'4"", 145 pounds, 34dd and ended up with the size small for reference. it fit well but definitely roomy - in case you're not into that style. never tried the extra small, but i would prefer this dress not to hug onto me so i stayed with the small.   this dress was really nice and comfy, soft material. the pockets are low and my phone stayed in while i walked but i wouldn't recommend anything heavier than a phone to go in the pockets.   i wore this to a family and friends function and re"
3038	3	a	Love this vest. fits very similar to the pilcro denim jacket. the fabric is softer, and not too heavy. the wash on mine is pretty close to the one in the picture, maybe half a shade darker. can see myself wearing this with summer maxi dresses, skirts, and pants, a very versatile piece that will go into fall. i usually take a 0/2 and the xs fit perfectly.
3039	1	a	I do not see this as frumpy if you wear it with heels. i think the bodice is very flattering.
3040	4	a	Love this t-shirt! i live in miami and have a 5 month old so i practically live in shorts and t-shirts, and this shirt fits beautifully and adds a little extra pop to your everyday t. love the material too!
3041	4	a	"Looks nice and i did like the button detail on the collar. colors are nove and the feel is soft. i would probably have to get a petite smaller size."
3042	4	a	"I read all reviews and i decided to try as the price was great. first of all i am 5'6"" 145 lbs, athletic build (not skinny but have muscles). the sweater fits great, just like glove, it does not make me look fat. the quality is great,sweater is warm, cozy and well-made. i am not sure about color as it's brighter as it shown. it is not quite coral, it's a little bit darker which will make it difficult to match it with. the sleeves run small so if you are taller then me just keep it in mind. th sw"
3043	4	a	"The quality of this sweater is excellent. it is well work the money. i am 34d 5'4"" and purchased a medium. fits perfectly for a fitted look and hits right at my natural waistline."
3044	1	a	This is a great dress from moving to summer into fall. it's great right now with the warm temps, but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit. it's very comfortable also. there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front. i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through. maybe, you can adjust it at the straps some. at any rate, it's a nice dress and i'm keeping it.
3045	1	a	"I agree with a prior reviewer who stated this seems overpriced - it is. it's very lightweight and not quite the quality i would expect for the price (the washing instructions tag was sewn in all crooked - really?). i ordered the black as i was hoping to wear this to a dressy (though not formal) event but i am not sure it works on me. i think it would be a really fun summer dress option in either of the 2 colors (the blue looks really pretty online).  it is very cute but definitely runs large."
3046	4	a	I really like this top, the material is thicker than i thought which is a good thing! it fits me very well and is very comfortable. i definitely recommend this shirt!
3047	1	a	"The overall color of this dress is more buttery white and the pale golden embroidery almost blends in.therefore i think the dress benefits from being styled . i tried bold colored scarves with fringes and big statement jewelry. this dress is more casual with its fringes , the jeans like material ( although softer than cotton) as well as the loose pullover style. it is easy to dress down with a blue jean jacket, casual sandals or even sneakers.  i have a 38 c chest and the l fits almost too loos"
3048	1	a	"Wow the mixed reviews on this dress would make someone not get it at all. it is true to size. i'm a 6 and the six fit as a glove on me. the material is not at all stiff. i actually wished it was a bit more structured. but that didn't bother me. i was able to close the zipper by myself. i'm 5'7"" 144lb 36a. the top feels confortable to me as well. i don't considered myself curve like jlo but i have hips. the dress does not make me feel bigger at all. the only down side is that it looks more expens"
3049	2	a	I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.
3050	4	a	The drape of this shirt is flattering, and i appreciate the longer tail in back. the fabric is light, and that is perfect for our fall transition here in so. california. with a sweater, it will be great in winter, too. so far, i've worn it with jeans and booties, and have accessorized it in different ways to dress it up or down.
3051	4	a	I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans, and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like, but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer, i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.
3052	4	a	The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.
3053	4	a	I totally disagree with previous reviewer on sizing. i am usually a medium (sometimes small) in various retailer tops and i purchased this top in a small. i could barely get it over my head. i then ordered the medium and large. i tried the large on first and it fits perfectly. (like the model shot). so i would say this definitely runs small. i never wear a large. for reference, i am 36c, broad shoulder. the gold beading on the top is very pretty and the gold embroidery thread really pops. t
3054	4	a	"I fell in love with this tunic on instagram, and couldn't wait to find it during the tops promotion. it was absolutely not a disappointment. as the other reviewer mentioned, the colors of the embroidery are brighter than they appear in the online images, and this actually makes the shirt more beautiful--they're rich and fallish, but not at all over the top.  i'm thrilled with the quality and overall cut of this tunic. i would agree that it might be best to run to a larger size in a range--i di"
3055	1	a	
3056	4	a	I was hesitant to buy this top after reading previous reviews, but i love it! granted, i am two months postpartum so i am looking for tops that are airy (it's summer in socal) but cover up my tummy. the material is soft and stretchy and it does have a loose shelf bra type inset---so not a real bra but at least something there. i wore a free people bralette with it and it looked perfect! really happy with this top!
3057	4	a	The uniqueness of this top caught my eye online. i normally wld not want a long sleeve top in the summer. a bit warm to wear outside now but i like the casual but unique style of it. it's a top i can wear now but only indoors with a/c. the regular small fits fine. a little oversized & sleeves a little long - as in the pic. the color/style/detaling is exactly as in the pic - no surprises. soft & comfy. a little opaque but a nude bra will work fine. i don't see the need for a tank/cami under it. i
3058	0	a	I ordered these without reading the previous reviews and i would have to agree with everything everyone has already said. these are the cutest cords i've seen in a long time! they're definitely skinny, bridging on way too skinny through the calves but i'm willing to stick it out. the thing that bugs me about them is how stinking short they are?? the description doesn't really mention that they're crops but at this length any ankle bootie is going to be too short. also, they aren't navy. they're
3059	4	a	"The metal detail @ the shoulders is the perfect touch to an otherwise ordinary tee.  regarding sizing. i am 5' 4"", 36dd and i usually have to buy l in tops and make alterations. after reading the other reviews i ordered a m & s. because my shoulders are narrow the s fit better. front measurement shoulder to hem is 24"" on both the s and the m. plenty of length for me. i also wasn't looking for a tight fit around the waist and tucking in just the front as shown on the model looks great. i saw thi"
3060	1	a	Comfortable and flattering for all body types...good for both day and evening...
3061	3	a	Simple blazer with cute details - buttons on the back and lining. this will look good both in the office over over a pair of jeans and booties. i was able to go with the regular size (instead of petite) because i will wear with the sleeve rolled up.
3062	4	a	This sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning! i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i don't usually pay this much for a cardigan, but the quality and feel are better than usual.
3063	4	a	I wanted to love this. it is so cute and the xxsp, my usual size, fit perfectly. however there was a fatal flaw in the construction. the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided. instead of a scoop like shown on the model, it was much longer on one side than the other. i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me, but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong. this is going back. i ordered another one (now it's on backorder), hopefully
3064	2	a	
3065	4	a	I love this shirt! it's such a beautiful striking color, yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight. the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute. i bought another one of these when it went on sale. so now i have two just in case;) haha
3066	4	a	
3067	4	a	Soft and unique. love the sleeves. my usual size medium fits perfectly. per the other reviewer, i guess my bust is large enough for the flowers to be on the side and not directly on breasts! my only wish is that it has some embroidery on it....love!!
3068	1	a	This dress is adorable - it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced, in my opinion). the tie detail is somewhat adjustable, and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7, 128#). where this gets me is the fact that it's dry clean...totally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer. i might bring it back for that alone, since i originally planned to wear it a lot. :(
3069	0	a	Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit, more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.
3070	0	a	Love the look, beautiful color, great length.  but with many of retailer's lace skirts, dresses and shirts the zipper did not eat to cooperate.
3071	5	a	This dress is very pretty and would be nice for a summer wedding. you will need to go braless or wear a strapless bra. i am sending it back because as it runs very small. i am a 34a and the size 2 was too snug across the top.
3072	1	a	This is a great dress for all body types. the fabric is substantial and soft.  i sized down for a closer fit, but i could have also bought my usual medium and had the extra space to belt it and wear a looser fit. i busted out the boots, a little early, and the outfit was done.  super easy to wear, dressed up or dressed down.  totally worth the price, i'm glad i didn't wait until it went on sale for fear of selling out.
3073	0	a	"I like the jeans a lot. they're definitely skinny fit and more like leggings -- very stretchy. i feel like they would fit all shapes and sizes because of that ""give,"" so the claim that they're flattering on everyone is probably valid. i also appreciate that there is no stonewashing, as grey jeans often seem to have -- they are all one hue from top to bottom, with a little bit of linear line texture to the fabric. the only flaw (at least i don't think it's intentional) is that the front pockets l"
3074	4	a	This is a closet staple! loose fitting, but lovely. well made!
3075	4	a	The only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big. i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for. i wouldn't say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect. still love it!
3076	1	a	"I have a short torso and short arms, so i purchased this in a petite medium. i probably could've worn the ps, but i do like the little extra room. it is a classic shirt dress with just enough of today's trendy ""frayed edge"" to make it contemporary. the fabric is super soft and lays nicely. i can imagine wearing this through the seasons with a variety of shoes/legwear & accessories! looking forward to it."
3077	2	a	"I really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great. however, the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy. i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft, not my 5'6"" self."
3078	4	a	"I love the way this top fits! i am busty on top and smaller on bottom, and it really flatters. it's funny to see it called ""off the shoulder"" b/c so far i have worn it on the shoulders. when worn on the shoulders, the neck is very flattering, kind of like a cowl neck. i probably would not wear it off the shoulder b/c of the whole bra strap challenge. i got the charcoal color which looks great with jeans or black leggings."
3079	4	a	"I agree with the other reviewer-- this is classic retailer old-style quality. the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical. the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist. i usually choose s/m in cardigans (for ref, 5'8"", 135 lbs, 34-b), but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me. i think it just depends what you are looking for. unique it is, and certainly lovely."
3080	4	a	Love this gorgeous off the shoulder top! very comfortable and stylish. you can wear it either off the shoulder or not!
3081	0	a	I was lucky enough to get these on sale with an additional 40% off, making them a fabulous deal. they are nicely made, and the shade of blue is very pretty. my only complaint, and the reason i'm on the fence is that they are so big. i usually buy a 31 in the ag stevie jeans, occasionally a 32, so i figured i'd be safe sizing down to a 30. wrong. i could have gone to a 29, and possibly even a 28....they're that big! i do like them though, and may just try shrinking them in the dryer.
3082	5	a	"This dress runs tts. the fabric is a good quality, and it has pockets. i am about 5'5"", and it hit just above the knee. i really wanted to keep it, but it hit me at an odd spot and not on my waistline. this made the dress look awkwardly full and me look hippy (despite the fact that my waist is 26"" and my hips are 35"")."
3083	1	a	I love this dress. the pattern is super cute and looks great with a jean jacket and comfy sandals or white sneakers. tons of compliments!!
3084	0	a	I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips, buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then, size up.
3085	1	a	I got this in blue and i love it! it skims your curves without being clingy, and it is very comfortable. i was hesitant to buy this, but it's surprisingly flattering! it will be perfect with heels for early fall, then worn with a long sleeve shirt and boots when the temperatures dip. my only caution is that it is shorter than it appears in this photo. it falls well above my knees, and i am shorter than the model. regardless, i am thrilled with my purchase!
3086	4	a	The shirt is mostly a thick sweatshirt material and is very short when trying on - undershirt required to make up for length and the see through mesh in the pattern.  felt about 1 size too small as well
3087	3	a	This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews, but it was way too big. sadly, i had to return it.
3088	0	a	They are beautiful in person, until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist, roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather, especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams, is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.
3089	4	a	Very cute on, fits well. versatile top, i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall.
3090	0	a	I am 5'3, curvy and wear a size 12 and these pants look amazing! often i struggle with wide keg pants bc they make me look short and plump, however, the material is buttery soft and hang in an elegant way and most important they are quite flattering. even if you don't think culottes will work for your body type- i suggest you give these a try.
3091	1	a	The length is lovely, the color is nice, the fabric feels like silk but isn't (so you can wash it), and the cut is flattering if you're a b cup or below. for me, the pleats on top made my chestiness look like fattiness.
3092	4	a	"This sweater is exactly what you think it is.   comfy!   it doesn't have much shape (it's pretty boxy), but that's the point. it's not one of those figure flattering kind, but it's also not shabby looking.   it's so darn comfortable and soft and the colors are so upbeat and beautiful.   since it's a fuzzy yarn type of fabric, i think the fuzz might start to fall out eventually and i have to be careful not to snag anything on it because i don't want to pull the knitting loose.   other t"
3093	1	a	I loved this dress when i saw it online, perfect for a summer wedding, but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely, it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly, it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.
3094	3	a	I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. i bought this jacket in m and it fits perfect! the sleeves are just the right length, it fits through the chest and hips. the leather and other material is super soft! i love the dark brown color, it's just as pictured. like someone else said, you can tuck the hanging material inside the jacket for a sleeker look. this is my new favorite jacket!
3095	2	a	This piece fits true to size and is very flattering on. sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat, but this wasn't an issue at all, probably because of the intricate lace details. the fabric is substantial enough that i don't feel like it'll get a hole in it after multiple wears.
3096	1	a	"This dress is very small in the bust and maxi length on short people (5'3"" 36dd). i can't wear a normal bra, i have to use adhesive pasties. the fabric is very smooth, thick and satin like, but fuzzes easily. mine came with minor thread pulls and one strap was sewn on twisted. the pattern in real life is very pink as opposed to the model sample which has more blue landscape. i'd like to hem the dress but i would sacrifice pattern. still very pretty dress. be sure to size up one or two depending"
3097	4	a	"I bought the tiny brand ""cassia"" tank last week in a small, and it fits beautifully. i ordered this ""sorcha"" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another."
3098	0	a	Adorable skirt. thought the a-line and length were great. 5'4 and 135lbs. went up a size and it fit perfect. can dress it up or down. really happy with this wardrobe staple.  not too stiff denim of so moves well and feels comfortable.
3099	4	a	"Great sweater. long and warm, but not too thick. i am 5'4"" and ordered a medium. fits and hangs nicely."
3100	0	a	"These were great pants that fit well, had good rise, perfect stretch for my curves, and i was really happy to get them on sale. (i'm 5'10"", 165lbs, with a pear shape).   after only three months of occasional wear (about once a week, at most), and following wash instructions perfectly, they started deteriorating. the pockets are becoming unsewn, the fabric has over-stretched in little sections that bunch, and the bottom hem is coming unraveled. these are the most low-quality horrible pants i've"
3101	4	a	I love this blouse! it is such a classic silhouette. the fit is not so loose on me as the model, but i have a much more curvy figure at a size 14/large. i am completely coverd up in this top, and the waistline is incredibly flattering to a full figure. the lace makes this top easily able to go from dressy to casual. i can see myself wearing this top again and again. great purchase.
3102	0	a	I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.
3103	4	a	This is a basic henley, and it is made well; a wardrobe staple, for sure. the cut is flattering, and the material is soft. i ordered the small, which is tight fitting. i'm a 34 c for reference.
3104	1	a	As a teacher, it's so great to be able to find dresses that are modest and beautiful, that i can wear to work, as well as on the weekends.
3105	4	a	This pullover is a great purchase. the color is simply stunning and is very comfortable.
3106	4	a	"Very pleasantly surprised by this top! it's looser, but in a flowy not baggy way. i ordered the m. the vee is just right on me, tasteful but just low enough. love the sleeve length ordered thinking another black tee , but it's going to be well used,and great for evenings."
3107	4	a	This cardigan is very similar to the c keer wrapped asters cardigan from a few years ago....i have this cardigan and have loved wearing it; i think it only came in cream color. unfortunately, i caught the cutouts a few times, and the cutouts are slightly ripped in 2 spots...not very noticeable, but i know they're there! so i was delighted to see that retailer brought back this cardigan, this time from meadow rue. i purchased both the cream and gray colors in a size small....i am usually a s
3108	4	a	The longer back makes this one of my favorite pieces for fall. the navy blue pairs well with the floral accents on the back. this blouse is a little too sheer for my liking, but nothing a cami cannot fix.
3109	4	a	I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style, but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded, and the trim of the shirt curl over, so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.
3110	1	a	"As soon as i saw this dress i ordered it...i didn't want to miss out on it. i loved the look...the colors were so fun and bright...i thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii. i am 5'4"" about 118#. i ordered a pxs. when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric. i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful. part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c"
3111	4	a	The blouse is as shown in the picture. it falls nicely and is flattering to wear. the detail on the yoke and hemline is of good quality. i've received a lot of compliments on this top.
3112	1	a	I thought this dress looked really cute and many people gave it great reviews. for me, there were a few key things off for it to work. i thought the material was soft, although not thick as you might expect with a turtleneck style dress. i ordered a small and the top fit ok, the arms were a little tight. then the larger problem was the body, it hides everything which is great but the way it fell and just sort of hung there, it didn't do anything for my figure and was not flattering around the wa
3113	0	a	"These pants have substance in the material, it seems thick. i found htem to be very comfortable and love the tir waist detail. my only ""complaint' is they don't come in petites, so on my short legs, teh hem came jsut above my ankle. i think htey would look nicer with a tighter shirt than pictured on the model. did not purchase,but keeping in mind for future..."
3114	2	a	Just not cute. i don't know how else to describe this top. i am a 34dd and ordered a large. it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am. i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn't in store so i returned.
3115	0	a	This is the 4th pair of current/elliot jeans i've bought.  i'm 5'4 so the length is perfect for flats.  they are so soft and cozy. wish they had a design on the pockets but love them none the less!
3116	2	a	This bra is so soft and comfortable i feel like i'm not wearing a bra at all, except i have the gentle support i need. the material is very thin and the pink color is see through, so not recommended under a white or see through shirt. perfect for sleeping or lounging in!
3117	4	a	At the beginning of the season i lusted over an ivory haute couture side-sliced tunic so much that i almost sprang for the $800 price tag. when i saw this at retailer, i realized it was similar, but had certain design elements that made it even more unique than the other. i just received it, and i was not disappointed! that cable neckline is beautiful, the 3/4 sleeves are perfect to show off a bracelet or two, and whether worn with skinny jeans, as shown, or wide leg trousers (as the haute
3118	1	a	"I tried this dress on and felt amazing in it.  i got home and showed my husband my purchases.  i told him i wasn't sure if i should have bought this one and told him to be honest with me.  he said it looked great and he was glad i bought it.  so great for a spring wedding. fits true to size.  i am 125 5'4"" c-cup and i bought my normal size 0.  this made my waist look really small."
3119	4	a	I now own this shirt in 4 different styles. although i don't expect it to last forever, thus far, they wash really well given how thin they are and light weight. i love the simple cut, and how good they look dressed up or down. it is so hard to find comfy tees, and this one fits the bill! my only wish is that they sold it in solid print colors like white and black. then i would own 6 ;)
3120	0	a	These jeans look amazing on! hug every curve in just the right way....the long length with flare...add a platform heel and i look like i have legs for days!! and my booty will definitely turn some heads! total splurge but for a great pair of jeans, totally worth it. ordered my usual size 27 and they fit like a dream. hope they don't stretch out after wearing a few hours. the amount of stretch feels nice, so i think they'll continue to hug your body. if you want 1 pair of flares in your wardrobe.
3121	4	a	Ordered this online and thought it was more of a red than the true orange that it is
3122	4	a	How cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south .... until i washed it! i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out. first of all, the smell was unbelievable! i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that, it shrunk. even though i handwashed it, line dried it and pampered it to no end!
3123	3	a	I love this piece !   i purchased it on sale months ago and when  i wear it i just love it!!  it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect it's very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing  i'm very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine  would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices   thx retailer!
3124	3	a	I am so glad i had read the other reviews of this jacket which prompted me to order. great fit and cut with a hint of stretch, nice styling details, great vintage color. i wasn't in love with the price but after receiving the jacket i would gladly pay the price again. will definitely be in my wardrobe rotation for years to come!
3125	4	a	This shirt is so soft and buttery! it fits tts and just as shown on the model. for the sale price, this shirt is a gonga! good go-to shirt on those days where you're just not sure what to wear. one thing that slightly bothers me about this shirt is that the arm holes are a bit loose, so you can see your bra. i think if you wear a black bra with it though, it would be fine.
3126	3	a	"Failed to read website description that vest is polyester shearling-lined.that's on me.  beware: pockets decorative only.  runs a size small due to fact vest is polyester shearling-lined."
3127	4	a	"This shirt is very comfortable. though it's casual, its uneven seams and asymmetry give it a little more edge and character. fits true to size. i'm 5'5'', 125 lbs and was happy with the small."
3128	4	a	"I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge, because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings. i'm 5'9"", so i got the m/l to ensure length. maybe that was wrong? if the ""laid flat width"" was included maybe that would have been more helpful, but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack. the side slits (of course hidden in the photos) came up to just over my natural waist, enhancing that effect. i loved the"
3129	1	a	I had seen this online a few times and while it caught my eye because of the color, i never really bothered to check out the details due to the stock photo. it looks quite bland as it doesn't really flatter the model. however, once i saw this dress in-store, i was drawn to it immediately. the dress is well made, the embroidery is delicate and beautiful with interesting design features. i love the combination of the summer dress with a collar. it makes this dress so work appropriate as well as it
3130	4	a	
3131	1	a	After readying the reviews of this dress, i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy, was i wrong! first, this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o' one size fits all' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall, the entire dress was not flattering. honestly, i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it.
3132	4	a	As other reviewers have said, this shirt runs a little short and wide. i usually wear petite, so the length didn't bother me. the sleeves fit me perfectly (which is rare in regular sizing), so others may find that they are too short and tight. to fix the boxiness issue, i just stitched 2 of the seams in the back together to give it more shape. since i bought the black pattern, my diy fix isn't too obvious but this may not work for the other colors. it needed a little work, but it was worth it fo
3133	1	a	This dress was adorable & fit great! regrettably, i had to return it since it wasn't lined.
3134	4	a	"I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it.   such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me."
3135	4	a	"I saw this in the store today, tried on a small and a medium and a medium fit me better which is unusual. usually i am a small. this top is fitted around the chest and flowing at the bottom, a little longer than usual but the pattern is so pretty that i got it. i am 5'4"" 135 pounds and got a medium."
3136	1	a	"This dress is gorgeous. it looks exactly as it appears on model. the model must be wearing a petite because the regular size dress is maxi length on anyone 5'8. the petite is midi length and is perfect every where else. i am not petite, but this petite worked perfect on me for midi length. pros of dress the dress has nice light float fabric, with colorblind on bottom for a touch of modern. the dress looks very dowton abby and the vintage look is hard to find now days in dress. the dress looks fa"
3137	4	a	Really love this blouse for several reasons....it fits! pretty true to size depending on how fitted you want it. not too much of a difference between a 6 or 8. it is a bit sheer but i am not worried about it. now my favorite part is the tie in the middle.....finally not a boxy waist, it's up to you to pull it in or loosen. the length is perfect...not too long so it works over skirts too. it is soft. my only concern is how long will it last. will require careful washing and ironing. may end up pu
3138	1	a	This dress was my absolute favorite recent retailer purchase. the fit is so flattering. i think this dress runs true to size-i usually wear a size 6 in hd in paris, and that's what size i ordered. i expect i could have fit in a 4 but the 6 is comfortable. i am 5'4'' but i ordered the regular length and it hit just above the knee. i agree that it could use pockets but no need for lining. however-- i just laundered this dress for the first time-hand wash, lay flat to dry (as recommended) and this dr
3139	1	a	This dress is beautiful on, is thin enough to be extremely comfortable. being curvy, it feels a little more narrow than i would prefer, but i kept it anyway because it is so beautiful as well as functional.
3140	1	a	"I was so in love with this dress when i saw it in the store but so disappointed when i put it on. i am 5'10"" with curves and usually buy a large in dresses. this dress looked like a sack on me. the top was way too big and loose making the dress a boxy cut rather than a maxi cut like i was expecting. the dress is lovely to look at on the hanger and feels good on but i don't think it flatters hourglass figures. it was the right length for me unlike many other reviewers.  obviously, based off the"
3141	1	a	Love this dress. purchased in white. runs true to size. made well.
3142	1	a	It was a little shorter than i expected i am 5'8 and 125 pounds. i ordered the extra small and it was a perfect fit aside from length. at 42 yrs old, i can't wear mid thigh dresses to work. hit hit me at the same length it hit the model in the picture.... even though she is 5'10. if you are 5'6 and below this is a beautiful dress
3143	1	a	I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it, but i could not. there were spots missing sequence, some fell off as i tried the dress on, and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly, for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes.
3144	4	a	"Great fit and quality. i'm 5'3"" and 130 lbs, size 4 fit perfectly. bought both the blue and black. could definitely dress up or down!"
3145	4	a	I love this top!!! i usually wear a medium but all that was left were larges, so i figured i'd take a chance. it is gorgeous, and not too big! the quality is fabulous, and the color is very soft and complimentary. i am so glad i ordered this. can't wait to wear it!!!
3146	3	a	"This coat is spectacular. it was love at first sight but it was only after trying it on in a store that i decided i really wanted it, even at the full price. the design is unique and gorgeous, you don't see coats like this on the street, not a cookie-cutter. it's very soft, yet warm, and has a gorgeous ochre colored lining making it very easy to put on and a standout when a bit of the lining is revealed. it seems the fit is what most reviewers complain about and i can see that. i tried size 2 ("

3148	0	a	"I love clothes, and my mom raised me to look for styles that are different, and unique. these pants are it! they fit beautifully, but run slightly big. i'm between a 4 and a 6, actually kept both. the 4 fits great in the hips and legs, plenty of room if you have curves (i do not), but it's a tad tight in the waist, if that helps. these are a perfect length, at 5' 7"" they hit above my ankle bone, and look perfect w a pointed, closed shoe. i love the colors, and am bored to death of black and grey"
3149	3	a	This jacket is really cute. i tried in in a large in the store and was too big so i took a chance and ordered medium on line. i have broad shoulders so i was a bit worried. it's perfect. very fitted and cropped. but will look great to throw on over a dress. for reference i'm 5 foot 6 inches and a 34 c. 132lbs. slender but athletic. medium was perfect.
3150	4	a	"True to size for petite person; bought in blue - subtle shading, looks great; paired with your blue straight leg blue ""jeans""; perfect outfit for almost all occasions."
3151	0	a	"I think these jeans are much better in person than on the picture. on the model they look a bit boxy and too loose for my taste. i am tall, slim/athletic and they fit like made for me in my usual size. they have some ""give"" and tend to get looser while you wear them, but because they are midrise they won't slide down. they are a slightly relaxed swlim fit on me. the demin is solid, the color a nice medium dark sky blue. the emobroidery and the beads are beautiful and look like they will hold up"
3152	1	a	I did not have to size up or down because of my body type (broad padded back, wide rib cage, narrow hips, small bum.) however, it fits a little odd on me. the back darts that start at the waist and are supposed to curve for your behind settle too high and wrinkle. the waist is also too high. the shoulders are a bit tight. i am confused because i bought the exact same size pieced brocade (the colorful version of this dress) and that one actually fits spot on. i have a feeling if i go to the store
3153	1	a	Great job from the fabricators in creating such a gorgeous print on light-as-air silk! i'm so happy with the dress and can stare at it for hours, that's how pretty it is. the fit is perfect on me and disguised my figure flaws since it's an a-line skirt that doesn't cling. yes, the skirt is sheer and unlined and for the price a slip should have been included. fortunately i own a silky half slip that complements nicely. i'm a top heavy 36dd, large rib cage, 140# with a square waist and no hips and
3154	4	a	"So, ordered online. tried this on, boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes.  back it goes. super cute but huge."
3155	4	a	I bought it to mainly wear as a coat but i think it'd be great with some leggings and boots as well. if you want a more structured look go a size smaller. i plan on wearing this more as outer wear so i went with large. the coral is beautiful
3156	4	a	I am a teacher and love finding cute, comfortable clothes. i wore this for the first time today and got compliments all day long! i felt so stylish, and i was still able to do what i needed to do!
3157	1	a	"This dress fits true to sizing for this dress designer (i.e.: a little on the large side as compared to other dressmakers). it is very flattering on and is made of cotton sailcloth, so it is not ""flowy""."
3158	4	a	Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front
3159	1	a	Nice, flowy dress... only thing is that it has the high low skirt which i think is getting outdated. beyond that, it is a cute dress.
3160	1	a	"I bought this dress for a trip to the caribbean and really enjoyed wearing it. i was worried it might look like a ""sack"" but i think it is both slimming and flattering. i love the interesting neckline and rolled up sleeves!! a winner."
3161	4	a	I purchased this in the coral color and i am very happy with it. i find it to run true to size, has a nice stretch to it, but fits close to the body. the coral is gorgeous and looks very nice with my olive skin. the only odd thing i have found is the sweater seems to have random darker fibers. i looked at all of them in this color in store and they all had some dark fibers... strange. but, i have worn a few times already and i am very happy.
3162	1	a	"I wanted to love this dress, but it has too many flaws. first, the ""waistband"" falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there. not a flattering silhouette.. second, the fabric is a sickly yellow-beige netting that looks like burlap. third, i can't imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it. on the plus side, the fabric isn't scratchy."
3163	4	a	
3164	1	a	This dress is casual enough to throw on as a cover up and dressy enough for a night out. it so comfy and versatile. will never go out of style. it does run large, but that is just the style of the dress. it really is the perfect summer dress.
3165	1	a	This dress does fit small.. i am generally a size 10-12 in maeve but purchased this in a 14. i have a large chest (34g) which contributed to my need to size up. the green color is beautiful and the dress looks darling on. i have a little trouble with the zipper but nothing that required me to return the dress. my biggest complaint is that the straps are a tiny bit too long and don't lie flat on my shoulders. other than that i receive a ton of compliments every time i wear it!
3166	1	a	This dress is very pretty, versatile and high quality! i'm planning to wear it to a wedding. with the holiday season coming up, i will definitely get to use it as well. the fabric is very comfortable especially the top part; it's very soft. i usually wear an xs petite, this dress seems to be a liiiiiittle too long for me and the waist is a tiny bit too loose from how i like it but it's manageable. (i have this dress in ivory top)
3167	4	a	This is a nice light top for the summer. i love how your shoulders peak out from tee, which gives it a touch of of sexiness. it does run large so i went down a size. i haven't washed it yet so don't know if it will shrink. i do recommend it though.
3168	2	a	I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool, soft, not itchy, light weight, lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th

3170	4	a	This sweater is pretty, fits tts, feels soft against the skin and has a good weight to it so cami is absolutely not needed. i particularly like the buttons on the side. you could unbutton to have the sweater feel more swingy and show more of the underlayer. the design in the back is simple and flattering for all figures, i think. this shade of gray is also appealing to me as it's not too light or dark and has a hint of periwinkle undertone to it. the sweater is on the shorter side but i do think
3171	0	a	I saw this in the store a few weeks back and desperately wanted it. when it wet on sale, i grabbed it! i normally wear an xs or petite s, but with this one, the petite m was the winner! i am chesty and the top would not have zipped up had i gone any smaller. it is a bit wide on the bottom, and i agree with the reviewer who said it should be a bit more tailored on the bottom. still, with some awesome heels, this is a great summer piece! the lining is great quality. love it!
3172	4	a	This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front, and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.
3173	1	a	I wanted to love this dress..and it did not disappoint! true to size, not too snug but doesn't make you look shapeless. the material is soft and has great movement. looks great with boots and booties. i know i will be wearing this one often!

3175	2	a	This is s very comfortable cami with comfortable and nicely designed straps in back.
3176	0	a	"Since these are high waist pants, i think the size given is more for a lower waist measurement where most pants these days typically sit. i'm 5'10"", 150 lbs and ordered a size 31 but it was much too large. i love the style of these pants a lot. they look great if you have long legs, the size 31 ran about 5"" above my ankle, higher than is shown in the photos but it looks great."
3177	1	a	"I have the ""charisma sheath"" by the same designer and love it so much i thought i'd try this one. looks so much better in person than in the picture. it's extremely flattering on my curve less frame. whenever i wear it to work, i get stopped and asked where i got it. great dress, you'll love it more in real life!"
3178	4	a	I love this top. the design is flattering and the fabric drapes nicely. the length is perfect and can dress it up and down.
3179	2	a	The adjustable tie is really nice and adds a nice style twist to a black suit.
3180	3	a	This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'4 and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.
3181	4	a	This jacket isn't as structures as i thought but it is very comfortable. runs true to size and feels nice. i am looking forward to wearing this in the fall
3182	1	a	"I've never been so bummed a dress didn't work for me. this is so cute. i love that it's got a bit of a sleeve. it's one of those easy, pop-it-on-and-go pieces i'd love to have in my closet. i'm 5'2"" and i tried on a 6p in the store and it was prefect except for the bust. the elastic peaked in the front and i can't imaging this dress working on anyone with more than a b cup. (i'm a d and it looked ridiculous in the bodice). i tried on a 6, and the proportions were all off. if the elastic went str"
3183	1	a	"Beautiful dress. loved the navy and the low v neck in front and back. but i had to return for smaller size. i am 5'2"" 114 lbs. i ordered small and it was a little big and definitely long. i returned for an xs petite and am hoping it will fit perfectly!"
3184	4	a	Comfortable with leggings or cropped skinnies. would be better as a solid as opposed to a plaid print. breathable and airy fabric.
3185	1	a	I love my blue dress, i'm a pear shape to the top fit fine on me. i know reviewers complained that the top was too tight, not so on me. it was also not sheer on me because it has a cotton lining underneath. got a lot of compliments!
3186	4	a	Please be awate that although this blouse is beautiful and the color is gorgeous--it is completely sheer!!! it just doesn't match up with the price point,
3187	1	a	"In both senses, it is pretty and big and pretty big. i ordered the xs as the xxs and xs petite were both out, and it is to big on me. i am usually xs petite or xs, if shorter. i definitely need xxs (petite or not). (115 lbs, 30 dd, 26-27 inch waist)  that being said, it is really cute and fun and flirt, but not romantic flirty, just girl next door flirty. the navy and white stripes are classic, so will last over the seasons. the cut is flattering, i really love it, just not on me being that"
3188	4	a	I'm 5'2, 105lbs and bought xsp. seems a bit too short for my taste especially since this is a popover, but not bad enough to return. everywhere else fits tts. nothing stunning about it, but is unique enough to add to my everyday casual. it would be better if there are more colors to choose from.
3189	3	a	I missed out on the sherpa vest in caramel last year and didn't want to miss out again - can't wait to wear this when it gets chilly. i am between a s & m but the small was very comfortable. it could be easilly layered over a thicker item, or a t-shirt as pictured. so glad i picked this one up.
3190	1	a	"This beautiful, soft, swingy, dress is oversized on me.  usually when someone reviews that a dress runs large but their body type is opposite mine, i pick tts and 90% of the time i'm right.  not so in this case. the outer dress is very wide and the amazing super stretchy under slip is too large also.  debating on sizing down because of potential shrinkage after laundering.  i bought m and my stats are 5'3"" 140# 39/28/35.  dress ends just above my knees.   agreeing with the previous reviews th"

3192	1	a	There isn't anything i don't love about this dress! get it before it's gone! i get compliments every time i wear this dress.
3193	1	a	This is a cute dress, but it runs very large through. if i had decided to keep it, i would have taken it to my seamstress to remove some of the volume. when i ordered, i assumed it was red and black checked, but it is navy. my black cropped leather jacket and boots won't work with those colors, so it is going back.
3194	4	a	This is my favorite find of the fall. i got the mustard color and it is wonderful.   very soft, nice shape, unique design. i am usually between a medium and large in tops, but i found that the medium was a little too short for my liking.  (i am  5 ft 8 in tall).  even sizing up, it's far too short for me to wear as a dress as some others had mentioned, but looks great with jeans and boots. the large is perfect!!
3195	2	a	I got the burgundy color and i do have to say that the color looks a little better online than it does in person, but it's not too much of a difference. this is a really cute thong, and if you're just trying to be sexy/romantic, then i think it would be fine and there's nothing at all wrong with it. however, i like to wear thongs just in general because i think they're comfortable and i like not having to worry about panty lines, and this is definitely not the most comfortable. the front pattern
3196	1	a	"When i saw this online, i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw, the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it: ___________ pros: - the colors you see online are exactly the same in person. - the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh"
3197	2	a	This unit is gorgeous as a dress or as a top with a cami, skinny jeans and boots. i'm wearing it to my cousins wedding and obsessed. i bought a long delicate necklace at retailer with a gold pendant and it falls perfectly with the neckline. my only slightly negative comment is about the quality. the material is beautiful but i noticed the elastic coming through the ends of the waistband where it snaps shut. still keeping it though!
3198	0	a	Wore this romper 1x and after washing, the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again, i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.
3199	4	a	I really love this shirt! i ordered the orange and am considering getting the other color too. it's very comfortable and cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. this shirt definitely runs large and i had to exchange the medium for a small. the looser cut makes it very easy for this to look like a maternity shirt, so i'd advise everyone to size down.
