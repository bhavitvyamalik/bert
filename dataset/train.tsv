0	1	a	After readying the reviews of this dress, i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy, was i wrong! first, this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o' one size fits all' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall, the entire dress was not flattering. honestly, i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it.
1	1	a	Unfortunately, this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8, 130lbs, and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also, while the dress is lined, both layers are quite thin- not see through, but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material, it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.
2	1	a	I ordered this dress in the blue color. it is lovely in person - but the petite seemed to run smaller than most petite dresses i buy from retailer. i ordered a 2p - and it was tight in the bust on me. i imagine a 4p would be perfect. i am 117 5'3 34b.
3	4	a	This tshirt hits at a great length not too long. so it doesn't make me feel top heavy! but it flows enough to hide any imperfections !   i ordered a medium.
4	0	a	This skirt is really beautiful and well made. the color is a cream/off white like other reviewers mentioned. it fits mostly true to size--i have a straight build with a wider stomach and no hips and my usual 4 fit a tad tight in the waist but perfect in the hips. i just love this skirt.
5	4	a	I loved this top when i first saw it. i tried on my usual size l, and there is no stretch through the bust, so it totally flattened my chest. a few weeks ago i noticed there were some xl's that must have been returned. i tried them on and they fit perfectly! i suggest sizing up if you have a chest, this is a very flattering top and it looks great paired with scarves as a wrap, skinny jeans and boots.
6	4	a	I love the lacey design of this top. however, it is very wide and doesn't fit well on someone with a small frame. i tried ordering a petit size. the width was better, but this size was too short. in addition, the lace didn't lay very flat, and there were lose threads all over. overall, not worth the price.
7	1	a	"This dress is not form fitting and some might consider it a little ""shapeless"". however, the color is stunning, the quality is great, and its a great dress for a wedding where you want to stand out but not have to worry about anything too constricting. great for dancing the night away - the under layer and frill at the bottom are perfect. i am very pleased with this purchase!"
8	4	a	"I love this sweater. i ordered the xs because i have very narrow hips and i didn't want it to be too baggy. it fits a little like a very short sweater dress on me. what i really love is that the arms are nice and long. one of my pet peeves is sweaters that are compromised in arm length.  i bought the pink and plan to get at least one other color too!"
9	3	a	This jacket is cozy, warm, and very cute, but after the 1st washing (according to the manufacturer's instructions) it began to pill and has worsened each time.
10	1	a	There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.
11	4	a	I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did. mine does not have any weird smell at all. i ordered a medium and i wear a size 8. it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings ...with coverage. the detailing on the yoke is so pretty. i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better. i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe!!
12	2	a	I'm extremely pleased with the quaiity of these leggings. the material is comfortable and supportive without feeling too restrictive. the pattern ans styling are slimming. most importantly, they don't slide down during your workout! i'm 5'8'' and a size 12-14 and the large fit perfectly.
13	5	a	The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so doesn't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. haven't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy, cool professor vibe that i like.
14	4	a	This top runs large. i am usually a medium in retailer but when i read the first review, i ordered a small, and it was the right decision. i also agree that this top might be short for someone with long torso. love the back detail and the print and color is really nice!
15	4	a	This is a great, casual top that can work in all seasons. i love it with skinny pants/jeans.
16	5	a	I was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures.  although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person, i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs.  the pictures don't really show the extreme brightness of the trim.  it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater.  to me it looked like something a child would wear.  i ordered the 1, which was the smallest size offered.  it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle.
17	3	a	I really like the look of the jacket and that it is stretching. sizing a bit odd. the xs is pretty snug in the arms, body is fitted. but the small seems 2 sizes larger. the body is very baggy. i kept the xs, but can't wear sleeves underneath!
18	4	a	"This 1960s aprã¨s-ski style sweater is made of an amazingly soft pure wool in a color that is a touch brighter and maybe even a bit more coral pink than the online photo looks to me. there is a large button under the collar that shows if you stand it up. seems to be of a very high quality, comparable to vintage hand-knit sweaters. . it is very chunky and warm, and i would recommend taking a size up for a looser fit. i'm 5'2"", 33-25-37, narrow shoulders, and otth the xs and s fit me well, running"
19	4	a	"Cute shirt. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. size s fits perfectly. a little shorter in the back than i'd like but great for layering."
20	4	a	I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings, but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though.
21	0	a	Wow, i can't believe there were some sizes left at my local store. it was on sale and i maxed out with additional discount for black friday week-end. the size 6 fit perfect and i can't wait to wear. this is a gorgeous skirt and will sell out for sure.
22	2	a	Cute, but didnt realize it was sweatshirt material. due to that, returning.
23	0	a	I love these so very much! by far my favorite addition to my wardrobe this summer. i find they are the first thing i grab because i feel wonderful in them. they fit perfect even with a large bust which i was afraid i would not be able to pull off....but very tastefully do. i highly recommend these and i plan to wear them into the fall with boots and long sleeve t-shirt. worth every penny. if your size is available grab them...you will be happy you did.
24	4	a	"This is a beautiful blouse but needs to be returned for size. i have lost a bit of weight; the last couple of blouses i have gotten in a m (including this one) have been to large for me. i am 5'5"" tall, 138 lbs and in this blouse need a s. the fabric is satiny and substantial with a gorgeous lining edged in contrasting thread., it hits at the top of my thigh in a regular size 8 but i should have ordered a 6. i would say to size down if you are close to being between sizes. the colors are as show"
25	1	a	This dress is perfect and so sweet! i do agree with other reviewers in that it runs about 1/2 to one size large. i run anywhere from 6-8 in retailer dresses and i ordered the 6. if you are usually in between sizes definitely order the smaller size. the smaller size also allows me to go braless even though i have a larger (34dd) chest because of the well-constructed bodice. length is nice for us tall girls as well!!
26	4	a	I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length. another customer had a similar review, but i still took a chance that it would fit well. the sides of the shirt have slits, and because the shirt is too short, it shows the skin on my hips. the rest of the shirt fit fairly well, but i'll still need to return this top.
27	4	a	So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it, i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing, the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i'm a 36 dd and mostly a size l, so that's what i ordered. it wasn't snug, but it didn't have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look, so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too, but i could have rolle
28	4	a	Love this top!! perfect date night top! you can dress it up with a cute pair of heels or wear it around doing errands in some flats.
29	0	a	This skirt fits true to size and sits on the natural waist nicely. i've paired it with black, and the contrast is very nice. the material is thick enough for winter, but will also work for the fall months, too.
30	5	a	Love the look of this and the fabric, but runs way small. i usually wear a 0. ordered the 0, then 2. just got the 4 and it's still too small. will be returning all 3.
31	4	a	I am in love with this sweater. i am 5'4 and wear a size 8 and bought a large. perfect length and fit. will wear with jeans or leggings. the quality was amazing and i can't wait to wear it!
32	4	a	Cute top but does stretch out a bit throughout the day.
33	4	a	Cute tank, runs big. i purchased the mango and it's a bit sheer.
34	0	a	"Since these are high waist pants, i think the size given is more for a lower waist measurement where most pants these days typically sit. i'm 5'10"", 150 lbs and ordered a size 31 but it was much too large. i love the style of these pants a lot. they look great if you have long legs, the size 31 ran about 5"" above my ankle, higher than is shown in the photos but it looks great."
35	1	a	"I was so skeptical about ordering this; it's really not my style. i'm more of a black halter dress kind of person. this is so cute, and flattering. it's well made, not flimsy, but is soft and pretty. i'm 5'6"" and weigh 130. i bought the small and it fits perfectly; the dress hits me right above the knee in front. i can see myself wearing this with cute sandals and a floppy hat at a beach bar, or wearing it wiht6 leggings ans shooties when it's cooler and dress it up with jewelry. side note; i'm"
36	2	a	First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee. i don't know why they do that.... you're not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it's cheap! second, i'm usually a 0-4 in retailer and mine is no where near as loose-fitting as the photo. also, he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit... like a flimsy t-shirt. and see-thru. the sleeves form-fit to my arms so i couldn't layer under it, but i couldn't wear it alone with the fa
37	1	a	"It's not often you can find a dress that is warm, cozy, timeless, and sexy at the same time, but this one is it. the material is thick but clings to the body in all the right places. i normally wear an xs or s, and in this i took an xs. sleeves are nice and long. your shoulders are exposed as much as you want them to be, depending on how low you fold over the collar piece. i chose to tack mine down in place, so i'm not always adjusting it.  i wore this dress with black heeled over-the-knee boots"
38	0	a	"I saw a photographer wearing this at a wedding i went to in october. i absolutely fell in love. it is beautiful. i can't wait to wear it for the holidays! i got the small petite and i am 5'2"", 125 lbs. fit great. enjoy!"
39	0	a	I wanted to love these great spring/summer pants, but sadly, they are just too unflattering for ladies with hips. if you have a ruler build, these pants will be fantastic, but these pants are not forgiving in the hip and thigh area for those of you blessed with a curvier build. i was really hoping for pants that had this clean, vintage inspired, audrey hepburn look re-imagined for the every-girl, because nothing is more flattering to an hourglass body than clean, non-bulky lines (something like
40	4	a	"I tried on the regular size at my store (wish stores close to me carried petites), and it was jsut too overwhelming (aka big). i wanted to purcahse the petite, however, as i really like it (striked out as they are sold out in my size, bummer).  the cut is otherwise flattering, and the sweater is really comfortable. i like all the contrasting ""colors"" and patterns too."
41	1	a	This will be a 3 season dress for me.. its well made, comfy and flattering . the suede skirt is risky i know .. but i'll be sure to put the napkin in my lap!
42	4	a	The blouse is as shown in the picture. it falls nicely and is flattering to wear. the detail on the yoke and hemline is of good quality. i've received a lot of compliments on this top.
43	4	a	I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back.
44	2	a	Retailerpologists has always carried the best sweatpants. i wish they sold these in more colors. very flattering!
45	4	a	Love this top. got xs fits perfectly. wish it came in more designs
46	0	a	I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally, i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.
47	0	a	I bought these about a month ago and i love them! great fit, not too tight for legging jeans, which means i can dress up with a tunic and boots for work. so stretchy and comfortable, but still made out of a jean-type material. love the color - it's a bit of a gray black, so looks great with everything!
48	4	a	"Thought i'd love this top; i'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer.  but i found the lace, while pretty, to be quite rough, which to me indicates a lower quality. and i guess i should've known that it would be very swingy (photos show that) but it really overwhelmed me.  for reference, 5'5"", 125 lbs, 34d. sad, but this went back."
49	2	a	These are both adorable and practical?they're versatile enough to dress up or down, and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures. these will definitely be my go-to tights this season.
50	4	a	"The shirt looks a lot less fitted on the model in the picture than how it fit in ""real"" life. size was not wrong, the material was just very clingy. i was not impressed and subsequently returned it."
51	2	a	"I saw this dress online and fell in love with it. it is just as beautiful in person too. very delicate, but receive so many compliments every time i wear. it is two separate pieces, a slip dress and the overlying fringe dress. i am 5'4"" and need a 2 inch wedge heel to keep the bottom from dragging. probably could have tried to order the petite but figured i'd probably be wearing heals anyway. i normally wear a 6/8 in dresses and the medium fit perfectly and is so flattering! the top half is flow"
52	4	a	"This shirt is very comfortable. though it's casual, its uneven seams and asymmetry give it a little more edge and character. fits true to size. i'm 5'5'', 125 lbs and was happy with the small."
53	2	a	I ordered the orange color too. these are perfect for throwing on over workout clothes and then running errands.
54	1	a	Unfortunately, this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big, too shapeless.
55	4	a	I bought this in the black and white and like it a lot. i typically wear an xs or s, and purchased the small. glad i did because i think the xs would have been too snug. i like the tunic length and the fabric feels soft and smooth. it's a little low cut for me, but i'll wear a cami under it.
56	4	a	Love this top, purchased it in the coral color now i'm definitely wanting it in the blue since it is such a great blouse for transitioning into fall. the weight of the top it good since i live in south texas so definitely needing lightweight long sleeves for our weather. i'm sure when the time comes adding a long cardigan or blazer over it as needed for the cooler weather it will look great. fit true to size.
57	0	a	I'm really excited that retailer is selling basics. i love the flow of this fabric and it does not cling. i haven't worn them yet but they'll be perfect for work. i look forward to trying on the other essential styles.
58	1	a	Sized up due to my 36ddd breastfeeding bust and the 14 for perfectly.  i am 5'6 and 165lbs, just fyi.  dress is super flattering on my post 4-baby body.  it's very slimming.  looking forward to wearing to a casual wedding,
59	0	a	The length on these are great. they stretch but so far they don't stretch out. the material is a dark and soft. i am 5'6' and 135lbs. the size 26 fit great.
60	1	a	"Like other ladies have mentioned, this dress runs small in the chest and waist region. you must size up! __________ pros: - flattering fit and flow. hides lumps and bumps. - cut at the neck and back is cute and didn't make me look chunky surprisingly. - little red polka dots aren't overwhelmingly at all and add a nice retro feel. - good overall length. - usa made! __________ cons: - runs small in the chest and waist. i'm a 36c, hourglass, 170 lbs and normally can wear a size 10 in tops"
61	0	a	"I love tracy reese. this skirt did not disappoint. i saw it originally in store & fell in love. i waited to see if it would go on sale... and it did!  i put on the size 12 & it fit gorgeously. the fabric is a bit stiff and bulky- but i think that's so it holds its shape. first thing i went into my living room & began twirling around.  i am 5'5"" 150lbs. athletic build. the sizing is true to tracy reese. i'll need to get the skirt hemmed as it's quite long on me. but- this little gem will be worn"
62	0	a	This skirt is worth every penny! it appears slightly different than pictured in terms of color -- it is a cream/blue gray making it very versatile. the crochet work is beautiful and cream. it is not too bright to show every dirt mark; the cream coordinates perfectly with the leather color. it is a classic, elegant design and could be paired with a silk type or even a cashmere sweater in the cooler months to come. for me, it is tts mostly (i am usually a 4-6) and the six fits perfectly. it has an
63	0	a	"This skirt is absolutely lovely!! i'm usually a perfect size 8 in all retailer clothes. i am curvy on the bottom and the skirt pulls slightly, so i will be sizing up. can't wait to get my new size!!!"
64	5	a	"I order from retailer regularly and am pretty consistently a 0 petite or xxs petite. i ordered this in a 0 petite and it was like 5 inches too small in the rib cage and chest area. even if i would have got it zipped up, the halter cut is cut narrow so you can't wear a bra for sure...strapless would be necessary. also, the actual neck part was tight. for reference, i am 5'3"", 108 pounds and a 32c bust. it seems you need to be flat chested to pull this one off and maybe missing a few ribs."
65	4	a	"I have received so many compliments on this top. it really looks exactly like it does on the model, and i'm not as thin as she is. i am 5'5"" and 134 lbs,, small on top, and bought the small in this top. the v-neck is very flattering and is hangs so nicely that it does not make me look hippy. looks great from all views. i paired it with white pencil pants and wedge heels. also, the black lace detail down the sides looked great when i paired it with black yoga pants and flip flops. the colors are"
66	4	a	"This top is beautiful! it is comfortable - soft and relaxed without being ""baggy."" colors are just as seen on the website...if not prettier. it is a versatile and flattering top; tucked in or not; sleeves rolled up or not; i love it!"
67	4	a	Just received this and absolutely love it! i tried the vienne cardigan in the store and i assumed this one would fit the same (since online exclusive), which it does. this one though has the whimsical left grey sleeve with trees, a fence and sheep on the sleeve - very cute. it's a traditional knit design with a twist of modern design being the cape style. it is a bit cropped but fits well and the hood lays nicely. there were a few too many stray threads when i received that i needed to cut off.
68	4	a	I love this shirt so much i bought it in another color. it looks like it does in the picture, loose and flowy.
69	0	a	"I have been waiting for these to go on sale for some time now, and so happy to day they still had my size...in both colors. i don't usually buy 2 things the same in different colors, but in this case, i did...  fit true to size for me, almost had a hard mite buttoning... but they are stretchy, so don't buy a bigger size, they will stretch. could not decide which color to keep so kept both... i ordered the 25p (0p) - i am 5'1.5"", and 115 lbs... i think these are vanity sized, but my usual vanit"
70	1	a	I love this cotton weave shift dress. it is supposed to be loose and not tight. i purchased a medium and fits the way i see it should fit. ref: 34dd, 148 lb; 5'4 height. hits above the knee but office appropriate as not too short. i paired it with a few seasons ago, the navy blue suede fringe jacket by retailer elevenses; new necklace in the blue motif from retailer ( it has a hanging druzy pendant) navy hose and navy crew neck long sleeve top.  great outfit for work and an after work party at retailer
71	2	a	I knew going in that it may not fit a d cup but the fabric is beautiful so i thought i'd give it a try. i wear a 36d and bought a large. it's got a clasp in the back so there's no adjustment on how it fits around which for me was too big. the triangles did not provide enough coverage, left too much side boob. the fabric was very pretty in person but thinner than i expected which also made it seem less sturdy. sadly, have to return and cancel the back-ordered bottoms. i would recommend to someone
72	3	a	This vest looks exactly as in pictures which is a good thing for online exclusives. i love the fact that it's lined and the texture and color of the fabric is very nice. has a good, solid quality feel to it. it does not have any buttons or belt that comes with it but looks perfectly fine just left opened. i wore it with belt as well and it add to the structured styling of the vest. more on the conservative side of retailer.
73	1	a	Gorgeous dress! fits true to size with high quality material. the colors are stunning.
74	1	a	Silhouette transcends many occasions.
75	1	a	Love this dress!! i ordered the blue for some color and it is nicer in person than in the photo. the fabric and color are beautiful. can dress this up or wear for work. i am 5', 110 lbs and 35/26/35 and got the size xs petite. it is a loose fit but not too loose. very unique dress that i can wear all fall and winter.
76	0	a	Like other reviewers, found leg more flared/straight than pictured. i wore all day at work (desk job) and didn't see any wrinkling.
77	4	a	I purchased this shirt in grey. i loved the color and the details, especially the lace on the shoulders. i just found the fit to be off for me. the style certainly calls for a relaxed fit but the small was loose in an unflattering way. had the xs been available i might have considered exchanging for an xs but the s was already a bit short on me. (strange because although i am not petite, i am fairly short wasted.) i also wasn't in love with the neckline. i will continue my search for a weekend-w
78	4	a	This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned, there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black, the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains, rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur
79	1	a	I was so ready to love this dress but it runs extremely small - like you should maybe purchase a size 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear.
80	1	a	"I meant to order this online and forgot. i was very happy when i was able to get it in one of the stores yesterday. it's everything a summer dress should be: flowy, lightweight and a great print. i can't believe there's no reviews and that it still available in every size. for reference i got a small i am 5'4""  135. this dress i thought would make me look wide because it's all straight across but in fact it really has a great flow and is cut well. grab it while you can."
81	4	a	My sister gave me this top for christmas and it's perfect. i find myself grabbing for it constantly. i'm usually an xsp and the xxs fits me perfectly. i wear it with leggings and jeans.
82	2	a	I was expecting these to be the normal thickness of everyday leggings, plus fleece. instead, they're more like thicker-than-average tights. still warm, though there's a weird seam on the inside of the thighs that takes away from some of the comfort. not so bad that i want to return them, but not what i was hoping for, either.
83	2	a	These are the best leggings! they were so comfortable that i wore them all day and then to bed; i didn't want to take them off. i'm hoping to get a few more pairs.
84	4	a	I love the elbow patches on this shirt. i ordered the wine color, and it's dark enough to almost be a neutral. i've worn it with many things already. my only complaint is that the sleeves are super long. typically, long sleeved shirts are too short for me, so i'm guessing this one would be ridiculously long on someone with short arms.
85	4	a	I bought one of these as a gift for a friend and i loved it so much i had to get one for myself! it's beautiful material and has lovely detail, a little sheer so best worn with a cami underneath. probably better for those with not too ample busts as it doesn't have a lot of stretch.
86	1	a	"I was so excited for this dress to arrive, but when it did, it was a major disappointment. there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer. also, the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way. the colors were beautiful, but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws. i am 5'6"" 140lb and the small fit tts. will be sending it back"
87	4	a	These are the cutest prints, but the cute simply doesn't work for me. this is longer than the conversationalist shirt, which is an improvement as far as i'm concerned. nevertheless, both my appropriate size, which i still felt was too short, and the size up, which hit at a flattering spot, were twice as wide as as my midsection. so while the arms and shoulders seem true to size, the shirt runs very wide.
88	1	a	"This dress is beautiful. i am happy i chose the sky blue color. i read a review before ordering that said it was more beautiful in person. it certainly is! i can't wait to wear it. the only issue is that it runs a tad bit too big. i am very thin, and usually an xs in retailer clothes. i could've fit an xxs. good thing the straps can tie and be adjusted. also, it is a little longer than i thought it would be on me (i am 5'7""). other than that, i love this dress."
89	4	a	"I agree with those who thought this material looked a little cheap. i ordered the white knowing about the sleeves and thought i'd like the slits, but the material + sleeves definitely gave an undesired pirate vibe.  true to size."
90	4	a	"The print, colors and fabric of this sweater are lovely. the design is quirky to say the least. i ordered a small, as i usually do. i am 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. this sweater somewhat gathers or balloons out at the hip area and is so huge that it looked like i was wearing a giant table cloth or stadium blanket. it looked like i had a pillow stuffed in my backside because of how the sweater gathers up at the waist. it's not flattering at all."
91	4	a	I got this in the grey and wore it the day i opened the package. one side is see through, so i wore a camisole underneath. it's lightweight and not at all clingy. i normally like my shirts in medium and this was true to size for me. perfect sweater for a fall day in new england.
92	4	a	I wanted to love this. it is so cute and the xxsp, my usual size, fit perfectly. however there was a fatal flaw in the construction. the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided. instead of a scoop like shown on the model, it was much longer on one side than the other. i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me, but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong. this is going back. i ordered another one (now it's on backorder), hopefully
93	1	a	"I had to return my original order to size down - the bottom half was fine with either size, but the medium was baggy in the back torso area. (i'm 5'8"", 150#). i bought the ""tangerine"" version, which really is more red than orange. it's versatile and can be paired with various third pieces and shoes. i do have a long torso and this waist is a bit short on me however."
94	1	a	I got this dress on line - i ordered several sizes after reading the reviews. it does run small. i usually wear a 2 in dresses and needed a 4. i love the fit and it is a beautiful dress - however the little black pin dots are easy to snag. i wore it once - didn't feel like i was wild that night - ha! - but when i took it off that night it had 3 places where it had snags - ugh!
95	4	a	Pretty top. quality material, it is not thin and see  through. size down because this runs large. although it is meant to be flowy, if you don't size down, the arm holes will show your bra and the rest of the body will have too much fabric looking too boxy and unflattering.
96	4	a	The burgundy plaid colors are what caught my eye! so perfect for the fall season. i usually do not like off the shoulder tops as most do not stay down but this one does and as others have stated there are arm stays inside to help with that. i stayed with my usual small to keep the length and it was fine. got compliments the first time i wore it. so glad they restocked in my size, as they had been sold out.
97	5	a	I loved the idea of these pants as i've been looking for an updated pair of tuxedo pants. i wear 26 in most of my jeans. i'm not super skinny & consider my legs medium (not too skinny & not too athletic). i tried these on in xs (36 european as marked on them) & they were big around the waist & hip area. there was so much gap in the back which made them look frumpy! i did however liked the length. the fabric is nice & heavy which i also loved. sadly, these didn't work for me though. really wish t
98	3	a	"First of all, i'm not a ""navy"" person at all. i much prefer black or other bright colors. i received an e'mail showing this trench last saturday and i pulled it up online and noticed how darling it looked. i didn't order it, but i went back the following day to check it out again. it was nowhere on the website. then a few days ago, back it popped up online again. i noticed it wasn't in my local store so i thought i'd go in and look this weekend. i just had to see it. i actually made it to the st"
99	4	a	This is a nice light weight cotton i purchased for work.. i usually take a size 4 or 6. i bought it online and opted for a size 6. i will be exchanging this for the smaller size, as it is a bit boxy and the sleeve length is ample. once the exchange is done i look forward to having this blouse that i can wear untucked and still not be wearing yet another tunic (my go to style).
100	0	a	Love these pants. it's hard to get really dark dark black jeans with a little stretch, and these are perfect. i also like the cut as a bit of a change from skin tight leggings. and the fabric is super cool, like a lightweight brocade denim. i get compliments every time i wear them.
101	4	a	I wish that it had fit me better as the feel of the fabric and the color were great! regrettably, i am sending it back as the v opening is too low for my tastes and the fabric on the left of the first layer drapes weird on me. i am usually a s or m and in this top the s was plenty of length and room, would be swimming in a m. the fabric was soft and felt great against your skin and not thin as some fabrics can be. the color was just as shown and beautiful. hope it works for some of you out there
102	0	a	Flattering, flirty, bright, beautiful romper. i wish it come in other colors because i want more!!!!
103	2	a	I love this! very comfortable & cute dress. true to size & picture. can't wait to wear it!
104	4	a	I tried this shirt in the purple motif, it fit true to size, my normal small worked well. all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in. really? on a white shirt? it annoyed me so much i didn't buy the shirt.
105	1	a	"Really cute dress for work. fits exactly as i expected. this dress is very comfortable and looks put together on days when you're being lazy and just want to ""throw something on""."
106	0	a	So i was super excited to get this skirt, unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured, it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier, i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re
107	4	a	"Here's the thing: this is a sweatercoat. it's not a coat. it's not something i'll be able to wear independently by the end of november, though i'm enjoying doing so now. it's boiled wool, and not lined, and though it's cozy and warm enough for a morning walk to the train in the high 40s, its role is going to end up being a mid layer. i'm also enjoying wearing it over both dresses and pants at work, serving as a kind of cardigan/blazer combination. i purchased the pink, which i saw online first a"
108	4	a	This top seemed so unique online, but in person it was really nothing like the pics. super full, shorter cut. the quality wasn't what i thought it would be. i will gladly pay for nice,quality fabric and unique prints anyday... but this wasn't any of those things..
109	1	a	"I have been shopping at retailer for years and this is my first review - that is how much i love this dress! it is so incredibly comfortable. it is like wearing a cozy blanket. you guys, it twirls. :) i never received as many compliments on an outfit as i do when i wear this dress. (i bought the orange one). i am plus size and i don't wear a whole lot of knee length dresses. dresses in general are hard to find because they don't fit right so i was thrilled to find this. i am also thrilled that it"
110	4	a	The print is awesome !
111	4	a	This is such a cute little top that can be easily worn off the shoulder or on the shoulders. it is comfortable, soft and quite flattering. it hangs nicely and is a pretty white top that will come in handy this spring and summer. i stayed tts on this one but could have sized down.
112	3	a	Great coat. love the length but it definitely runs big. i got a m even though i would normally be a l and it's roomy. fabric has pulles under the arms after 1 wear but overall quality is good. very warm. great look for work w. black pants.
113	1	a	"I love this dress, the print is beautiful, the fabric has a nice heavy drape and the cut is simple but unique. i'm short and curvy so generally shapeless dresses don't work on me, this is an exception.  i ordered the regular instead of the petite and it is full length on me, which i think i like more than if it were a midi.  the armholes do cut in, i wasn't sure if i liked that until i sized down and it fit closer.  my husband chuckled that it's a little mrs. roper... i don't care, i'm wea"
114	0	a	Like others, i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters, these pants run small, so i ordered a size up but still in petite, because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived, they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p), and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length, but i'm not sure i'll bother, based on some of the other reviews.
115	1	a	"I ordered this dress in a size 12. i'm 5'9'' and 180lb. i usually wear size 14 but the 12 fit beautifully. the material has a nice stretch to it so that i think it would still fit whether i gained or loss 10 lbs. when i pulled it out of the box i immediately thought it read ""grandma"", but was pleasantly surprised when i put it on. it is snug in the waist and flares out nicely from there. it hits me on the knee exactly as it does the model in the picture. i plan on wearing this maybe for christma"
116	0	a	Pants were super comfortable. a little too large. and the fabric was a little too heavy. i sent them back, and i'm regretting it now that they're completely unavailable.
117	1	a	Got this dress in the mail today, and it's definitely a keeper. the material is high quality, and i can see wearing this dress on all but the coldest days of winter. it'll be great to wear today in 90 degree weather, and with a cardigan and booties, it will easily transition into cool weather. the colors, patterns, and lace are all just beautiful. for reference, i always order xs for loose fitting dresses, and a size 4 for close fitting styles. the xs in this dress is perfect.
118	0	a	I love these jeans and want to keep them but they are so long! im 5'7 and they wrap all the way under my feet so i cant even have them altered because it would cut the flare out. its kind of crazy how long they are.
119	4	a	I wore this top recently and received several compliments. it's a great top with the off the shoulder trend, plus you can wear a normal bra underneath! runs large so i recommend one size down.
120	4	a	This top is pretty and i did not find it sheer at all but i am returning it due to the lace sleeves are tight. but, i do have large arms! other than the sleeves i would keep it!
121	2	a	This jacket is very cozy but i had to send it back. i think it will be great on a taller person.
122	2	a	"Love the design of these pants and they are super comfortable. perfect for running errands but managing not to look like you just rolled out of bed. bought the regular m size (usually i want petite because i'm 5'1"") and while they are a little long they still fit relatively well"
123	4	a	Im size 16 top and the xl is a little big but it is a longer tshirt whihc i love thank you sooo much please return the size large back...
124	0	a	Super cute but order at least one size up
125	4	a	I went to retailer for a pair of pants and walked out with this tunic in the blue motif and the pilcro cords in dark turquoise. this sweater, like the one i purchased last season by the same designer, is well made and the fabric is luxuriously soft (like cashmere soft). am so excited that the weather is finally cooling down to wear it!
126	2	a	This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium
127	1	a	"This is instantly one of my favorite dresses but please note it runs large, size down! i am 5'10"" and regularly a size 8-10. i tried both of those sizes on in store and picked the 8. it was perfectly form fitted and the perfect length. when i got home i realized i had been reading the uk sizes on the tag and really bought a size 4. no idea how it fit me, i have never purchased a size 4 in my life! i am adding a photo so potential customers can see what it looks like on an average sized person :)"
128	1	a	Based on the mixed reviews about fit, i waited to purchase until i could try it on in the store and was not disappointed. i'm wondering if there are different batches of this dress? i'm 5'7 and the dress fit as in the photo. the side slits come above my knees but not too high. arm holes are a bit large so if you want more coverage this may not be for you. the material is cozy and soft. the cream color is gorgeous. size wise, it definitely looks boxy and marshmallow-like if too loose. i am usuall
129	1	a	"I tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today. it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress, with very interestingly cut seams. the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract. gorgeous and high quality!  fit: i am 5'6"" and curvy, usually a size 14/16, and the xl fits quite roomy on me (that's the size i ordered because i like flowy things). so it definitely runs large. usually i have better luck with a-line dress shap"
130	2	a	"I understand what the previous reviewer meant when she says these are great for around the house. the yarn is thick but the weave is open so they are nicely springy but not very warm.  they look perfect with my birkenstocks so i'm getting then in all colors."
131	4	a	Love this t. i now have all the colors. it is so soft and comfortable. great with jeans or dressed up with leggings and boots. and when i feeling lazy i just keep it on and use it as a night shirt to sleep in. it's that comfortable! i found the size to be spot on.
132	4	a	I love it! the fit is very flattering. i read in another review that the top runs small, so i got a small instead of an extra small and it fits perfectly.
133	3	a	I am wearing a large in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
134	2	a	These are a bit oversized, order a size down. they are a nice weight and look great under tunics.
135	4	a	"I just got this in xs/s at my store and i love it. i have a petite frame (5'3"", +/- 105 lbs) so it's much longer on me than on the models. and the one i got is much more saturated with dye on the front than what's shown in retailer's pics, so that may vary a bit. however, the back of mine looks exactly like what's shown above. i love the drape and the way it falls on me; super casual-chic in my opinion. i'd say the color is deep teal. wish it wasn't hand wash, but sometimes that's worth it."
136	3	a	"I have not a actually purchased this coat yet but was able to try it on at my local retailer. thought i'd pass along a couple of details the description is missing. the coat is not lined. i have regular length arms and the sleeves are a bit short, not quite 3/4 length but not long enough to keep my wrists warm. also, i was afraid the red would be more orange, it is a very pretty red. it also runs a little big. i am 5'4"" medium, athletic build and would probably consider a m but it seemed bi"
137	0	a	I love all the pilcro chinos. they fit great and the material is so soft. they also wash very well.
138	4	a	"This is as pretty in person as it is online, good quality (except one item i'll get to), and fits true to size. i'm 5'6"", normally a medium/8, and the medium fit great in this top. i almost kept this shirt...so close, i had it on a hanger, but i kept trying it on. the shirt is well displayed in the pics online, but unless you get close it's hard to see that the top button is set a little wide. every time i put it on, my eyes went to the top button (i did get a second opinion and they agreed)..."
139	2	a	Love this! easy to dress up and down, has a great length on the torso but the sleeves are about 2-3 inches from my wrist bone, i see why the model has them pushed/rolled up- which is how i wear the shirt now too. but then it's hard to layer under a coat.
140	4	a	This is a great shirt with cute details including the ruffled back. i am petite and needed to shorten the sleeves, but otherwise the fit was true to size and not too baggy or too tight. the material feels avergage in quality, but looks polished with navy blue pants. i received several compliments during my first wear. overall, a very cute shirt!
141	4	a	I ordered the xx petite on this one, and unlike last year's version of a similar sweater, this one is a bit longer and looser. last year, i kept the xs p, but it was shorter too. the fit is loose, not snug or form-fitting, even as the smallest size available, it was loose but not large or unflattering. the length was also appropriate. love the colors, and pattern too. the material is soft, and the button detail in the back is fun. i am 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs, for reference.
142	4	a	"I love this shirt. i actually bought two in black (my ""uniform""), then decided to order one in white as well. however, the white shirt fit differently than the two black ones! it was significantly shorter; over 2' shorter! while the black tee is the perfect length, the shorter white version wasn't flattering on me and kind of flared out around my waist...not the best look. that being said, i know the black shirt will be in heavy rotation for a while, and the people at retailer were very und"
143	4	a	I was so excited to order this top - it looked like it was made of more sturdy, soft cotton, but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true. it's incredibly sheer - you'd have to wear a cami underneath, which defeated the point for me. the pleating in the front hides your bra, but you can see it from all other angles (i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra, which can easily hide under sheer clothing). i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to
144	5	a	"I tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific. it's very light-weight fabric but isn't see-through. the colors are medium in depth, not too bright. if you typically wear ""cool"" colors and avoid browns, you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted. there's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in. i'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs, so there's simply too much fabric in the dress. i would have bought a petite. the tag says it's avai"
145	4	a	I now own this shirt in 4 different styles. although i don't expect it to last forever, thus far, they wash really well given how thin they are and light weight. i love the simple cut, and how good they look dressed up or down. it is so hard to find comfy tees, and this one fits the bill! my only wish is that they sold it in solid print colors like white and black. then i would own 6 ;)
146	4	a	"True to size for petite person; bought in blue - subtle shading, looks great; paired with your blue straight leg blue ""jeans""; perfect outfit for almost all occasions."
147	4	a	I purchased the pale green in this sweater first. loved it so much i purchased in another color.
148	4	a	I wasn't excited enough about this to purchase it, but i did like it. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
149	4	a	I'm obsessed with this top! i got it for christmas and wore it to dinner with black pants and flats and got lots of compliments. the fit is cute and fun and the detail is about even prettier in person.
150	1	a	Just received this dress in the mail. it's stunning!! the lace is just beautiful. i ordered two sizes and had to size down a bit - the fit is generous. can't wait to wear this to my rehearsal dinner next week.
151	3	a	I purchased this vest in the store. the colors vary depending on where it is sewn - i purchased one with black around the middle, and more black around the collar (it was more flattering). the fit and design are lovely. it's fuzzy, but since i don't have any 'fur' in my wardrobe, this is a nice ease into that part of fashion for me. i highly recommend it, even for the price.
152	1	a	"I purchased the dress on a promotion.  the dress i received had the sleeves end about the elbow.  i added a 4"" black cotton lace to the sleeves.  i love the result.  it makes the design richer and brings out the lace running down the front of the dress.  the sleeves are a much better length for me now.  dress runs tts.  i purchased a medium, am 5'7"", 150 lbs, really am large boned, straight up and down."
153	4	a	Loved this shirt but it runs pretty big. i'm normally a sm/med due to bust size (34ddd) and ordered a small based on other reviews. could have gotten an x-small. debating going to exchange. i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale. better quality than some at retailer.
154	4	a	Mutliple layers of buttery softness. i bought the blue and it's true to size. it is soo soft, i could wear this to sleep. it drapes beautifully. highly recommend it. now i want to buy all the colors!
155	4	a	"I really loved this top the minute i put it on. read the other reviews but it really worked for me. i am 5'3"", 36dd, athletic build and the m fit perfectly with a nice roomy fit. top will be perfect for my upcoming trip to tahoe. plan to wear with light denim, dark denim, and black cropped denim bottoms. even looks great with a culottes or denim skirt. the weight is really nice and it washed nicely. i washed on delicate, and laid flat to dry. a little pressing and good as new. it has a nice boze"
156	4	a	The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern. a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering. very happy with this purchase. i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish.
157	4	a	"The blouse is lovely - i loved the lace, color (though just as other reviewers mentioned its a darker blue closer to a teal color) and edging. i am very petite, for reference, 5'2"", 24 waist and 30e and normally wear a 00 or 00p. the 00 was still too wide for me around the waist/bottom and had too much of a swingy effect - it made me look like i was pregnant so i sadly returned. i wish this had more of a fitted look to it."
158	4	a	I am very happy with this shirt. i don't like skin tight clothes. i bought this top a bit loose but it does not look like i am wearing a sack. it is tunic length on me so i have worn it with jeans and boots. i love the way it flows while i walk. very flattering on. would definitely recommend!
159	1	a	I bought the orange color and the pattern is absolutely beautiful. the fabric and style is very flattering and comfortable. well worth it. runs true to size (i am usually an xsmall 134 lbs 34 c and the xsmall fit perfect). perfect summer dress: soft fabric and light.
160	2	a	Does not say ribbed. did not want ribbed. would not have bought ribbed
161	1	a	I have the t shirt from last year and i love it so could not wait to try the dress. why didn't you make it in petite? it can work with some tailoring but petite sizing esp since this runs on the big side, would have been ideal. love the navy, will try the white. how about some more colors and petite?? please??? more t shirt dresses in general too please!!
162	1	a	I love the cut of this dress. i can see how some would not like the way the arms are cut. i love the pockets and the way this dress flows when you walk it it. it's very fun to wear. i am wearing it to an awards show and was a little worried it may be too casual but the texture and weight of the fabric make it look more dressy. i will be getting a lot of mileage out of this dress.
163	0	a	The fabric is very thick and textured almost like upholstery and has no give to it.  the zipper is a little tricky to get all the way up because of the fabric thickness. i looks cute and holds its shape. it may run a touch small because of the fabric. the colors are great though and i really like it.
164	0	a	The fit in the skirt is flexible because the waist is elastic and the shape is flattering, it doesn't stick out too far over the butt. the brocade texture and gold and blue colors are very fall. looking forward to wearing this with boots and tights. i'm usually either a large or medium in skirts and i went for a medium in this one.
165	4	a	"Tried this on in the ""onsie"" area of retailer store. i usually am between a medium and a large. the medium fit fine. the material in this top is substantial - very thick and soft but it is very thick as a warning. more for a pretty cool spring evening vs the heat of the summer in chicago. not sure how much the material would stretch out either. as it seems like it could be the type. also, it is dry clean only, and on such a casual top, that is a real deal killer for me.   regarding the style of"
166	0	a	"These pants have substance in the material, it seems thick. i found htem to be very comfortable and love the tir waist detail. my only ""complaint' is they don't come in petites, so on my short legs, teh hem came jsut above my ankle. i think htey would look nicer with a tighter shirt than pictured on the model. did not purchase,but keeping in mind for future..."
167	4	a	I tried the gray pattern on in the store and it is very soft and pretty. the fabric has a nice drape to it. however the length was too long on me, so i came online to find it in petite, but most of the petite sizes are sold out in the gray. i shop at retailer because i like it that so many of their styles are available in petite, however the petite length sizes seem to sell out much faster than the regular sizes. i hope retailer will give us short girls a break and order more petite length sizes so
168	3	a	The jacket was nice and soft but it was too short on my torso with a cropped fit which i'm not a fan of that style. i returned it.
169	0	a	This is my second pair of pilcro jeans and the second time i am totally impressed. these jeans have a comfortable stretch and rugged wash that is trendy & fun. they are the perfect everyday jean and look great casually with a pair of birkenstocks or converse low tops. the only thing worth pointing out is that i am pretty short (5'4) and the regular length fits me perfectly. this may be an issue for ladies lucky enough to have some extra inches on me.
170	2	a	Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small , and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium.
171	0	a	"I love these pants, they are a great addition to my work wardrobe. the fit is very flattering, with the wide legs falling perfectly, and they are a great length. i got the red, which is a beautiful and brighter than the pics. the fabric is a nice weight, perfect for fl winters. i personally like the mid-rise as it helps with tucking in shirts that are on the shorter side. i highly recommend these pants as a nice alternative in color and cut for the office. i'm 5'7"" and 135lbs and i purchased the"
172	4	a	This is a basic henley, and it is made well; a wardrobe staple, for sure. the cut is flattering, and the material is soft. i ordered the small, which is tight fitting. i'm a 34 c for reference.
173	4	a	I gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it! i get many compliments on this top! i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls :)
174	4	a	"Got this in the white and it fits perfectly. just the right length and enough detail on the shoulders. i'm 5'6"" and 120 (usually an xxs or xs for tops) and the xs fits just right, not too loose not too tight. i like the style since it emphasizes my shoulders and balances nicely with cropped jeans (i'm pear shaped). material is slightly clingy but it adds to the drape nicely (wouldn't work well if it was fitted, but it's not)."
175	4	a	I found this to fit tts. i sometimes wear petite, but found the petite sizing to be a little off. i have a pretty short torso, but found the petite to be too short. i opted for the regular sizing and got a 6; it fits great. this top is great for work (styled with a cardigan or blazer) or for play. i can see it dressing up or down very easily.
176	1	a	"Well...this is ""on me"" as i saw this hanging in the store, but way off on my size which is xxs petite.  i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.  both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no ""flow,"" just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.  this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes"
177	3	a	Bought one for myself and one for my mom.  we both love it.  super soft. boxy and oversized but great for layering over a belted tunic.
178	1	a	I love this dress! i ordered a petite size and just love how it fits. i would highly recommend this dress, too cute!
179	4	a	Beautifully made, designer sweater. and it's soft and comfortable. i decided to return because it's just too much for my body.  the fringe, which is quite long, overwhelmed my shape and i looked much larger than i am. the color is true white. the knit itself is fuzzy. it closes with a single button on the placket at the neckline. although not for me, i do recommend.
180	4	a	"This is a beautiful quality knit. i do wish that it was a tad bit longer...i'm 5'7"" with a long torso and found it to hit like the model shot. since the sweater flares a little at the bottom, i think it might be more flattering a little longer. keeping this regardless because it will still get plenty of wear."
181	4	a	I just bought this in the yellow and am very pleased!!! the sleeves are super long but i'm happy about that! usually, they are much too short, this is much cozier! this will look cute over dresses and with jeans and a longer/tunic style top. nice quality too
182	0	a	"I got these in gray. like other reviewers mentioned, the waist is a little higher (not 70s though) but the jean had great control so it ""holds"" everything in instead of creating a muffin top which many shorter waisted jeans do. contours to the leg. love it!"
183	0	a	I tried this on in the store and thought the flowy fit and asymmetrical hem were great. the fabric is thin, which is nice for summer, but lined at the top half so it's not transparent except below the knee. the waist is quite high and has flexible elastic for an easy fit. i liked the skirt a lot and came online to find it in petite. sadly, it is sold out of most sizes in the petite length. i wish antrho would order more of the petite sizes because they seem to sell out fast!
184	1	a	"I loved this dress so much i bought in the cream/pink as well as the blue/teal. it is so light and easy to throw on. the slits are higher on me (i am 5'2) but not in a risquã© way. it's very flattering and gives it a little sassiness.  i wish they had even more colors to choose from. that is how obsessed i am with it!"
185	5	a	I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however, in person, it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor.
186	4	a	"While i loved the sleeves on this sweater (the lace detailing was beautiful) the core area was really big. i agree with another reviewer who said it looked like a maternity top. i was hopeful but i sent it back. i am 5'7"", 128lb and ordered the small."
187	4	a	Despite the delicacy of the fabric and femininity of the patterns, the cut of this blouse is rather androgynous and not in a flattering or modern way. ick. so disappointed.
188	1	a	First off, i love the dress! i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in 20 minutes. the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a d+cup. i ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly except in the bust. easy fix, a white cami, the sale price makes that necessity acceptable. it's a keeper.
189	0	a	"These are great-looking chinos and very comfortable. i'm 5'11"" and--unrolled--they are long enough for me."
190	4	a	"I ordered my usual sz s during the promo. arrived yesterday & the fit is perfect w/ a little room to spare for layering. it's a snap front closure, front patch pockets, & attached hood that is small to med size-not huge or overwhelming. it's 100% acrylic which isn't my 1st choice, but soft, comfy & seems good quality. length falls abt 3"" below my knees. arm length is fine. pretty much looks as in the pic including the marled color. if you are in need of a great functional long swtr w/ good looks"
191	1	a	"This dress is fabulous with attention to most details. 5'4"" 103 lbs the 00 fits perfectly. overall fit is excellent, sleek, but not form fitting so very appropriate for work. length is also great, another plus.for work, many times the dresses are just a tad short, but this is great. arm holes are also great, not overly long as they often are. very nicely lined, substantial fabric. the only lack of attention to detail is they did not include the bra strap holders. why can't more dresses be made t"
192	2	a	"I am 5'2"", 110 lbs and i ordered my usual size xs and they fit perfectly. they are so soft and comfortable and keep me very warm. i can't wait to take them with me when we go to the snow next month!"
193	1	a	The cut and design of this dress is lovely! the fabric is heavy enough for fall/winter, but the sleeveless style makes it a great transition piece for when the weather warms up again. it does run slightly larger than most other retailer dresses. i sized down to a 2 from a 4. the bust stretches a bit for the ladies who might be heavier on top (i'm a 34 dd), however, i noticed the white shows through in dark places around my bust. also, the boning in the front pushed against the fabric a bit
194	4	a	Love this sweater. it fits true to size. fun and different. purchased 30% off but i don't think the price it terrible depending on your clothing budget.
195	1	a	"I've been hesitant to try on rompers, in part because they seem complicated and i also too worry that i would look a bit like mutton disguised as lamb in one of them! however, i saw this romper and fell in love with the pattern and had to try it on!  the pattern and color are wonderful, and i instantly felt glamorous, like betty grable in a cute cheesecake photograph! i had to buy it, and have since received tons of compliments on it (and i have yet to feel that i am too one foot in the grave t"
196	1	a	"This is a wow dress as far as fit if you are a voluptuous or hourglass figure  woman. i have  a 38inch bust and the medium fit perfectly...the whole dress fit perfectly. i'm so glad i took a risk and ordered it. i wish it was made from a better material  like cotton versus polyester, but it has such a nice fit that i'll forgive the material choice."
197	4	a	Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo, you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not, it is terribly unflattering.
198	1	a	"The pics online for this dress are horrible in comparison how stunning this dress is in person. just received it and far exceeded my wildest expectations! it is elegant, classy, and an understated sexy! the colors are rich and vibrant.......gorgeous shades of plum and blue....a unique color combination that is gorgeous! the open mess dress with the solid under layer is a wow! beautiful and flattering fit. it is a 10 !!!! i ordered my usual size and i would say it is true to size, but slig"
199	4	a	"This is a very pretty sweater, a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look."
200	4	a	I bought this top in the store, which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold, tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.
201	4	a	The photos don't do the top justice. the split back is very unique and adorable. i typically take a size 8 in tops, but ordered a 12 since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders. the 12 shoulder fit perfectly, but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in. i like it enough that i'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body. with the sale price, it is worth tailoring.
202	1	a	This dress is a bit longer than photographed but i was totally ok with that. the skirt is also a bit fuller which makes the dress more formal. it's really well made and great material. i'm 5'6 123lb and bought a size 4.
203	1	a	This is the most comfortable, sweet, beautiful, romantic and timeless dress. i bought the green motif one is sz 14 and it fits perfectly. i am smaller chested (usually a 12/medium/large up top depending on the item) and a sz 14/xl/33 for pants so perhaps this dress runs one size small? the color in the detail shot is most accurate - it's bright & cheerful and dreamy.
204	1	a	Love this dress! the color is gorgeous! what you don't see until you see the dress in person is the beautiful detail of the stitched flowers on the dress. i received so many compliments when i wore this dress. the sleeves are sheer and the material light weight. you can wear this dress year round. i love these kind of dresses! retailer knows how to do this right! love this store!
205	4	a	It's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i can't wait for cooler weather. i tried it on with skinny jeans and it's darling. love how it's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum. perfect for leggings. nice slim, but not tight fit.
206	3	a	I had my eye on this coat for so long. when i saw it was on sale and an extra 30% off i decided to go for it. i ignored the reviews that said it ran big and took a chance and sadly it did not pay off. this jacket is very heavy so if you are going to get it on sale, it will probably go into the closet for next winter. it was very boxy on me and tied at the waist, made my upper half look huge. it was just not flattering at all. the heaviness of it also made the big open neck a little annoying and
207	3	a	Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes, contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex, and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters, sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece!
208	2	a	A truly unwearable slip: scratchy fabric, bunchy skirt, teeny bodice. it feels like you are wearing wrapping paper--the foil kind.
209	4	a	"This top makes you feel like you should be in the tropics sipping a frosty cocktail. fabric is soft, not too sheer. i'm usually an xs and that's what i kept in this top. armholes not too low as in some. for reference, 5'4"", 123 lbs"
210	4	a	This top is really comfortable, and the details make it easy to add interest to an outfit. i was worried all the details together would be a bit overwhelming, but it works. i wish the design was on the back as well, but it's fine. the material is a nice light weight, but the pleats do fold up a little after washing, so ironing is required.
211	0	a	I tried on the blue in store and ordered the red in petite, and they are both too long (which means i will have to hem). i am not sure if i want to spend the extra money on hemming so hanging on to them for now as i love hte cut and color. they fit like a glove otherwise (i do have muscular thighs). the 0p is good for me (115 lbs). can't go wrong for a nice pant, i can see wearing these out or for work...
212	1	a	"This dress will be very useful. it fits loose, but it is suppose to. i plan to wear this to casual parties, out to dinner, and possibly a wedding at a winery. i weigh am 5' 6"", weigh 145 lbs, and ordered a medium."
213	4	a	I could wear this every day, it is stylish and comfortable
214	1	a	"I love this dress. i typically do not like or wear dresses often, and definitely not this style. i'm glad i tried something different. i received numerous compliments on how flattering and attractive it is. yes the belt is only in the front, but i cinched it very tight and it pulled the back in. i bought size s. it was very form fitting in the top and waist, and not too big through the hips. i have a 38"" bust and i can button all the top without pulling. i wore it with black tights and high brow"
215	4	a	"This is a great top. i love how it's loose and hangs away from my body but is banded at the bottom so it isn't shapeless. the tie at the neck is cute and gives it some personality.  i usually bounce between a s or xs. i tried the xs in the store but ordered the s."
216	0	a	"I tried this on in the store as soon as i saw it because of it's ease, modern look, and my obsession with stripes and wrap skirts. i am between an 8 and 10 in retailer most of the time (although sizing has been quite erratic in the last couple of years), but picked up a 10 to ensure an easy fit. was so surprised to find you have to not only buckle (cute detail) but button and zip this ""easy"" skirt, and with all that there were also straps that buttoned that i believe are there to keep it from flyi"
217	1	a	"The title says it all. while the quality was good, when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper. the length was longer than on the model (makes sense since i am only 5'5""), which was ok, but the overall fit was just too big. i am a size 2 and tried the xs, which was huge. just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way. going back!"
218	4	a	"The other reviewers have already adequately praised this very attractive sweater, but i'd like to add that the sizing is large. i fit perfectly into a regular small, although regular medium is my usual size. i am 5/1"", 130#, 34f, size 8 top. the medium swamped me. the shoulders and sleeves were comical, and the body too big. i imagine many of you are scoping out this lovely, comfy piece; you'll want to hit the right size the first time. my store didn't get the coral, so i can't speak for that, b"
219	1	a	"This is the reason i doggedly fight for items at retailer as there are often maybe 6 made in my xxsp.  you really have to see this in person. even the slip could be worn as a chemise alone with the double layer and dots. the colors are gorgeous. i wanted this to try with my burgundy velvet blazer (and it works withe the copper color - too).   the dress is really a swing shape - not close fitting - no ""waistline"" so it is very comfortable. the sleeves are fitted, but stretchy so should not be a"
220	2	a	This was surprisingly more complimentary and easier to wear than i though it would be. i love vix bathing suits and the quality is exceptional!
221	4	a	This gorgeous sky blue sweater was already in the dressing room to try on; i was not shopping for anything like this whatsoever. well, i tried it on and decided it was a must-buy. i usually need a petite in sweaters and coats, but this one, because i prefer a longer length, fits just fine, and the sleeves are not too long. the color is beautiful. it seems to be warm enough for sf evenings. it think the price is quite reasonable for a sweater/coat like this. a great purchase!
222	0	a	There comes a point where i have to draw the line with things i purchase... i ordered this as i didn't have a black skirt, but thought ti wasn't special enough, don't get me wrong, it fits nicely, and is comfortable, but i was wowed. 0p or xs p fir perfectly, 26.5 in waist and 115 lbs. if you want ta nice casual skirt, the sale price is a good fir for the skirt, just wasn't enough for me :-)
223	5	a	This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large, i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so, but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe, though, is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled, the background color of this skirt is not even close to
224	3	a	I really like the pilcrow denim military jacket. fabric is comfortably soft, but the jacket is still structured. love the tie detail in the back and the contrasting sleeves. i wear either a small or medium. i tried both sizes with this jacket and decided on the medium to allow for an extended season wear.
225	4	a	This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!
226	4	a	I love this sweater because it is so versatile! it looks casual with jeans, but i plan to wear it to the opera with dressy black slacks. the beautiful black embroidery is unusual and asymmetrical in back.
227	1	a	Just received and tried it on right away. really flattering fit and comfortable! unusual neckline that you can wear plain or accessorize. i'm so happy i decided to take a chance on this one!
228	1	a	"I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors, and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made, but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7"" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this, i would say size down two sizes."
229	0	a	It is soooo cute!!! i'm trying to figure a few things before deciding to keep..... how one goes to the bathroom when wearing it? i can't figure out how to get it on without help tying the straps in the back?
230	4	a	Comfortable and cute. versatile colors that can be worn with virtually anything.
231	4	a	Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not
232	0	a	It's hard to tell how jeans will fit when shopping online. i was very pleasantly surprised. they are super soft, very high quality and look even better in person. i'm 5'3 118 lbs and i ordered the 27p and may have to get them taken up an inch, but they fit perfectly through the hips and come in at the knee. i'm big in the hips and small in the waist and they fit perfectly. highly recommend for petites out there!
233	1	a	I just received this dress and i'm glad i read previous reviews and ordered a size up. i normally wear an xs or s and ordered a medium it fits perfectly. the color is beautiful and the dress is unique. can't wait to find a special event to wear it.
234	4	a	Wonderful fabric, drapes nicely from waist= flattering, use for air travel as not too heavy in weght. beautiful charcoal grey goes with all colors. nice addition to tight, patterned pants & boots. dress up or casual
235	0	a	These pants are very, very cute and high quality. they can be worn with a variety of colors and can be dressed up or down. they are also very flattering. i definitely recommend sizing up as they run small. my normal size was a tad tight in the waist and there is very little stretch - but the next size up was perfect.
236	4	a	Love the design and the gold color, but the seams between knit and lace were a little weird and bunched/weren't smooth. maybe the one i tried on just needed to be ironed or something...
237	4	a	I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body.
238	4	a	"What a great top! i am 5'9"" - 136 lbs with a 34d chest.. and this top looks and feels great on. i am usually a 6 and the small fit perfectly. i purchased the grey and it is a nice medium grey color. the v in front hits in a great spot.. not too low, but just low enough to look feminine. i haven't washed and dried the top yet, so i hope it looks as good after washing as it does brand new. i was hesitant to order because of the earlier reviews, but i find this top really works for me, so i am glad"
239	0	a	Just purchased these online and couldn't wait to try them on! they are soft, comfortable and my new favorite pair of jeans! i love them! i am 5'8 and sz. 29...the color and quality are above my expectations :)
240	2	a	Soft pretty socks. a little big if you have smaller feet. i'm a size 7.5, and they are a tad too big but still comfortable.
241	0	a	Thank you pilcro for making a skirt that is a great alternative to shorts or capris. i bought the green skirt and wore it on vacation. i realized a lighter color would be nice for summer, and ordered the light blue. it's tempting to get the red as well. the fit is great. i am 5'7 and the length is perfect. the skirt has weight. i am sure i will wear both of my skirts time and time again.
242	4	a	Love this top! runs true to size. exactly as pictured.
243	1	a	Saw this online- my size out (xs/s p). online did have xs. checked store saw how great the dress looked at store, able to try on only one avail at store (m). ordered xs online. fits well with ada belt and cardigan. until straps altered will keep cardigan on.very comfortable and cute- lots of compliments worn to work
244	4	a	"Love this top! has a beautiful shape, and it wasn't too long on my 5'3"" frame. puella always makes items with lovely, soft cotton, and this is no exception! awesome piece for summer!"
245	4	a	The picture doesn't do this blouse any justice. the fabric is really nice and the back is really what makes this blouse. the bows down the back of the blouse make it pop!
246	1	a	Super cute, flowy, and flattering. i would buy again in a heartbeat.
247	4	a	I tried this on in store and since my usual size 6 wasn't available i tried on a 4. it was a little snug in the upper sleeves and shoulders but was lovely otherwise. i passed on it and waited for it to go on sale to order it online. i got it in my usual size 6 but it seemed to me like it was 2 sizes bigger than the 4. i have decided to keep it but i just wasn't thrilled with the fit.
248	3	a	"I am 5 feet and 120. i ordered a petite small in moss. i have posted a photo below. it's a pretty green. the lining is pretty. the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and ""slips"" a little when putting the jacket on. but it doesn't effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably. it's floppy, but not sloppy. i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip. it was a nice surprise. i'm curvy and busty. i have zero problem with it being unflattering. the s"
249	1	a	"This is a very beautiful dress, with the detail of the inside lining, with a very beautiful fabric as well, creating a double layer effect, it creates a great flow. i am not sure i would use it with the belt (which is beautiful, a part of it is crochet), but if i don't, the dress would be too long. i am a size xl and 5'6"", so if you are shorter than that, i would try it before buying it. since it's getting cold here in colorado, i'll have to wait for next year to really experience going out with"
250	1	a	I love purchasing these tunic/ruffle dresses because they can be worn anywhere.....this dress is definitely a little on the heavy side for winter wear...the color is beautiful...i am 5'4''. 138 pounds and always purchase a large for a relaxed fit....i plan to wear it out to dinner for my birthday and to a house party on new years day....
251	4	a	I ordered this in a l online, and wasn't a fan when i received it. the colors are pretty bright, but they also look cheap in my opinion. it also had an awkward fit, because of the material there is no give at all, it was really tight on my chest (36d) for reference. and it was also pretty short, and i'm short! it barely hit the top of my pants...and i'm 5'2! back it went.
252	4	a	"This tee shirt is just adorable. i found it at a local retailer and decided to try it on - and just loved it! i happened to walk out of my dressing room while wearing it, to talk to my daughter who was shopping with me and three customers in the hall said"" that is so cute!"" and went to find their own. i bought the ivory color, but the other colors are really nice as well.  the fabric is substantial, soft and thick. the little ruffle at the shoulder makes a cute statement, but is just fun and not"
253	4	a	I bought a similar top by same manufacturer in fall in xs. this time it ran huge and had to order xxs which fit fine. it's very cute on.
254	4	a	I have this top in the blue print and i love it. i'm super tempted to buy it in the black as well since i love it so much, but it might be a little pricy to have two of the same top. the only thing i will warn women about this top is that if you are busty then i would recommend going up a size. i wear a small in most retailer clothes but i went for a medium in this top. while the small did fit in al other areas, it looked like the buttons were going to pop at my bust.
255	4	a	I love this top and the beading is beautiful, but just like everyone else, it was way too large. i normally wear a lg, but the large looks and feels like a 3xl. beautiful but large
256	4	a	I was really excited for this sweater, its not terrible but its not great. the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it. it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it. i would try a different sweater.
257	2	a	I cant say enough about these pants - they are such good quality. i bought the xs. they are tight enough and don't create crease in my legs. length is perfect for my 5.1 statue.
258	3	a	Runs a little small, but is very chic!!! you can wear it with jeans and a white t-shirt and you are going to look awesome!!!
259	0	a	I bought this skirt in the store a few months ago, because i anticipated that retailer would sell out of my size considering how great the fit/look of this skirt is. sure enough, they've sold out of the size 2. normally i wear a size 4, sometimes 6, in skirts depending on the cut and where it's from; just last year i bought a skirt from retailer in a size 10! for me, this was a skirt i needed to try on to get the perfect size, but it's absolutely adorable and a great deal at the sale price! it's mod
260	1	a	"I was bummed about this dress! i saw it online and loved both colors. i tried it on in the store, and it did not work for me. i am 5'8"" tall with an hourglass figure, and it was too shot and too loose. it looked like a babydoll nightgown. i wanted to love it, but i think this one only works on smaller frames. onto the next..."
261	1	a	I opened the package and the dress is two pieces. it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over. the sweater was too short for me, as i am busty and would not work. i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn't try it on.
262	4	a	I got the green motif color which is really multi color: blue, orange, purple, yellow, green and brown. the fabric is gauzy and sheer, nice and breezy for summer. there is a subtle stitching detail at the shoulders. i ordered my usual size, medium, and it fits well in the shoulders and arm holes, but it is extremely billowy in the body. i had to take it in a couple inches on each side to make it a little less full. it's still has some swing, but not quite as much as before.
263	0	a	What a great, easy to wear jumpsuit! i love that the sleeves are a relaxed fit...sometimes they make these jumpsuits so unforgiving who wants to wrangle your way in and out? anyway i totally agree with the other reviewers that this is very stylish, comfortable and it looks amazing on.
264	1	a	"This dress is gorgeous. it looks exactly as it appears on model. the model must be wearing a petite because the regular size dress is maxi length on anyone 5'8. the petite is midi length and is perfect every where else. i am not petite, but this petite worked perfect on me for midi length. pros of dress the dress has nice light float fabric, with colorblind on bottom for a touch of modern. the dress looks very dowton abby and the vintage look is hard to find now days in dress. the dress looks fa"
265	4	a	"I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately, however, i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.  the quality seemed okay, but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long."
266	1	a	So many things to love: love the mod kind of style, the forgiving pleats and empire waist and the fabric quality. but the neckline is just way too deep. if they didn't pin the one on the model, i'm a monkey's uncle. that super low neckline takes what should be a nice day dress and turns it into something you can't really wear in a church or in front of your dad. i seriously considered altering it, but the waist is already so high, i felt it would ruin the line of the dress.
267	4	a	Nice basic shirt to wear with jeans. it is super soft and hangs nicely. runs true to size.
268	2	a	Love this tank. material and fit are great. love that it's reversible. highly recommend!
269	4	a	This is very cute, but i will have to size up my large to extra large. and normally i wear a medium or large. it is quite tight as a large. it looks a lot cuter on the model. so i am hoping the extra large does it.
270	4	a	I love a good white blouse and this shirt does not disappoint. the detailing of the lace and bead work make it extra special. i just love it. it can be dressed up or worn with jeans. it runs a bit wide. i normally don't buy a petite in tops because i am long in the body but i did with this one after i tried the regular.
271	4	a	"Drawn to the colors, i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist, size 10/12 or l in fitted tops this top is a cropped, even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement), but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full, so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up, too. the quality is an issue, with exposed threads and irregular seams."
272	1	a	"I love sweater dresses and was excited to find a dress that would be long enough for me to feel comfortable in. i am petite, but at my age i am not comfortable in things that fall more than an inch or two above my knee. this dress is much shorter than stated, and much shorter than it looks on the model. i measured the petite xxs (my normal size) and it is 31"" from the shoulder seam to the hem, not 36"" as stated. five inches is a big discrepancy. the color and style were lovely, but i just can't"
273	4	a	As a curvy, short gal, finding a nice button down that isn't boxy or way too low cut is like finding a gem. this shirt is perfect for work, and i love how flattering it is. my only reservation is that it is more sheer than i would like, and so i need a camisole with it. i wish this style came in more colors!
274	2	a	"I bought this on a whim.  i have a difficult time finding a great fitting suit, especially online!    this suit is structured so well.  the material will seemingly last way longer than most of my other suits that are priced much higher.  the material i feel holds in my stomach. i have a large bust and it is comfortably supported in this.     the design is so cute and i love the way the way crisscrossed.  it makes a one piece feel less like a one piece."
275	4	a	I now have this tee in 3 colors - partly because my daughter loves and shares them with me. i typically get a size medium because i like things to fit a little loose, but needed a small in this shirt. goes great with all styles of jeans/knakis.
276	0	a	This caught my eye, purely by accident as i was in the dressing room. immediately attracted to the pattern, the color, the quality and the shape of the skirt. lo and behold, it turned out to be maeve, one of my favorite designers at retailer. this skirt does not disappoint at all. i normally try to wait for sales to make a purchase, but this is well worth the full retail price. the skirt is very well made. the material is structured but not stiff. i also don't normally like high waisted ski
277	4	a	I got a m in this top and was a little scared but i absolutly love this top, i was debating on it and then caught it on the 30% off sale, my first retailer purchase and it definitely won't be my last! great quality, so comfortable, and very cute!
278	4	a	I usually wear a s. the reviews were helpful. looking at the pic this shirt does look a little on the fitted side. i ordered a size m & it fits perfectly! the sleeve length is fine too! the colors are dark, not as in the photo. i do like the frayed edge look too. i have some skinnys like that. i had been looking at this shirt for months but thought it was a bit pricey. at the sale price plus the promo discount it makes it very much worth it. no regrets. hope this isn't tmi.. of note: the dark bl
279	5	a	This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.
280	3	a	"I am very happy about the jacket. i like the material and the cut. i was able to wear the jacket for a walk on a rather windy day, about 60 f, with a thin sweater underneath, and it felt comfortable.   the fit is very flattering. i would prefer the sleeves to be a little longer (5'7"", 125 lb, got size s). also, i wish the lining was full, not just the front detail - it would allow more versatility. but that's just me...  overall, i like it :))"
281	2	a	Such cute tights! i saw them and had to have them. they are a thick knit - very good quality. the color is a dark navy and the little foxes and a nice pop of color. i get lots of compliments on them.
282	4	a	I was happy to receive this sweater in no time at all. when i opened the package it seemed too thin, however, after trying it on, it's the perfect fit and style. can be worn with jeans or skirts and even dress slacks. great buy.
283	4	a	Wore for the 4th with white jeans super cute love the ruffle
284	4	a	"I'm usually a small (5'5"", 116 lbs, long torso), but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures, but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close, mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however, it is rather short, possibly because it is an x-small, and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom, which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect"
285	0	a	I love these shorts. would buy them in every color! the colors are all fabulous and the fit is great too. not too short, not too tight. very soft comfy feel.
286	1	a	"I did like this dress. it has a good simple shape, and is very comfortable. however, it's plain, and for the price and it being dry clean only, i'll wait to see if it'll go on sale. it's also worth noting that i'm 5'2"" and was uncomfortable with the length of the petite, but the regular size was a good length (right at the knees)."
287	4	a	A breath of fresh air. spring flowers! easy to wear. very feminine and flattering. looks great with denim, orange, reds , etc. very happy with this purchase.
288	1	a	"I was really hoping that this dress would fit perfectly because it looks beautiful on the model! however, when i put the dress on, there is a seam where the top portion meets the bottom portion and it made the skirt stick out a ton. i ordered the 0p and i am 5'4"" 110lbs. maybe ordering this dress in a larger size would prevent the skirt from looking so full at the top."
289	4	a	Nicely made, pretty details, but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!
290	4	a	"I loved this top; it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white; however, on this one, the chest area is too big, in both the 14 and 16, and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big. i probably need a size 12, but then i fear it would be too short-waisted on me, for i am 5'10"". unfortunately, it is not for me. also, the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t"
291	2	a	They are a perfect thickness. fits comfortably like leggings but look like a nice pair of office/ outside pant. got them in the grey, am thrilled w the texture. i typically wear a large in pants and they are tts. not see through either. would definitely recommend them.
292	4	a	This is a great tee. true to size, i ordered the large and it skims nicely over my hips. it has lovely quirky design features in the back and pinkish cross stitches on the sleeves and shoulders. i got the blue and it looks just like the pic. great weight for the rest of summer into fall. perfect addition to my casual life style.
293	1	a	This dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me, not so much. i am normally a size 0/00 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker, but it was very thin and didn't seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design, just not the right material or fit.
294	4	a	This is a great quality top. it did not look great on me, since i am quite top heavy. but is lovely.
295	1	a	"As other reviews noted, this runs large--huge is more like it. it's great quality, but i'm wondering now if the s/m would take me through the third trimester of pregnancy (which is why i ordered a m/l). i'm 5'7"", and if i were any less, i don't think this would work for me at all."
296	1	a	Unique, sophisticated and versatile summer dress that you will fall in love with. dress it up with heels for a night at the gallery or dress is down with a denim jacket for an easy day look. it needs no accessories. this silk dress is soft and it lays beautifully. you will want to wear it all summer long. fits tts. love it!
297	1	a	This dress is beautiful! it is a nice, heavy fabric with stretch and just fits perfectly.
298	2	a	"The blue looks a lot more grey in person and i've gotten several compliments wearing it with black leggings and grey booties. the texture/print is really unique. i'm 5' 11"" 135 pounds and a small fits perfect. highly recommend!!"
299	4	a	"If you're like me and wish you could carry on downtown boho dressing when the time to take out your puffer comes to pass, this tunic is essential. though the silky alpaca-wool knit is thicker than gauzy cotton, it drapes just as well and keeps one's self warm and cozy without the bulk of a sweater. i was concerned with the elastic banding at the bottom of the tunic because i'm only 5'4"", but high-waisted, and banded hems tends to always hit me at the wrong spot. luckily, it's not very binding, s"
300	1	a	"I saw this online and said to myself, next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress. i am glad i did! i bought the neutral dress (off white,tan.black) because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions. i am 5'6"", 136 pounds, the small fit me perfect! in retailer dresses i am between a small/med. the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus. the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to"
301	4	a	"I saw this dress online and i ordered immediately! it has everything i love: my fav color, a peplum and feminine cut out details. i ordered my usual size medium, and it was too tight in the chest, and i am just average... 34c. loved it so reordered in a size large. if you are thinking of purchasing this beauty i would suggest going up a size if you are on the upper end of your size (medium 8/10 and i am usually a 10 so needed to go up) the reason i gave the quality a lower rating is that the med"
302	1	a	This dress is very figure flattering.  however, it is not navy it's purple.  overall nice print, somewhat cheap material and zipper gets stuck.  i am keeping because it's versatile and i like the vintage floral pattern.
303	4	a	I love the way this loosley falls and is so light you barely feel it on you. it is very sheer to you need to wear another tank underneath.
304	4	a	I love this top! i just bought it on sale so the price was great but it would have been totally worth it paying full price! great quality, unique, and great fit. i look forward to wearing it all year!
305	4	a	"Let me start off by saying how pretty this top is, and heavy,.and itchy!  you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top (with your arms not touching any part of the top!  the sequins will itch if you put your arms down (underneath the armhole).  another reason i didn't like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable.  i would have to get mine tailored for my 5'2"" frame.  i usually wear a medium or 6/8 in tops and ordered this in a medium, it was roomy."
306	0	a	"I'm a 5'7""and curvy, these pants fit well and are so comfortable. i think everyone should own at least one pair!"
307	1	a	Love this dress! ordered a 0p and it fit perfectly.
308	4	a	"I received this top over the weekend and i absolutely love it! it does not smell, nor does it itch, as the other reviewer stated... at least not for me. i was worried about the green color, but it's quite lovely. this is a keeper for me! i am 5'1"", but ordered the regular xs, and i am happy with the length."
309	4	a	Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!
310	0	a	These would have been the perfect black pants! great cut, love the wide band in the front, true to size, quality construction. but a zipper in the back?!!! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up. perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller, but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on. sending them back, since i don't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need.
311	4	a	This one will be going back. the color is really blah and the fabric wasn't a texture i was expecting--it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day. overall, the cut and style is cute, but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style. this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric.
312	2	a	These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy, sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great.
313	4	a	Love this top. beautiful. received a lot of compliments.
314	4	a	Love,love, love this. it is so different and unique. definitely not something you will see in any other store. wore it last week and have never received so many compliments on one piece. so retailer!!!!!! it was very warm and comfortable. i did wear a turtleneck under this, because of reviews of itching. i did not have any problems.
315	4	a	This romantic top has lovely embroidery and beading details. i purchased this in purple, which is actually more of a cranberry color. i like that the detail work carries over to the back on the cap sleeves.
316	0	a	"I've been trying on ""boyfriend"" jeans for more than a year, finally found a pair that fit and were comfortable. many of them had no stretch at all and were very uncomfortable. these have just enough stretch, but not too much. i usually wear a 29-30, tried on the 29 which were comfortable but too loose at the waist. the 28 were a perfect fit. i'm 5'8"", 140lbs."
317	2	a	I love this top! i've already worn it 3 times since getting it about 2 weeks ago. it is beautiful and has a lovely, subtle pattern to the fabric that i didn't initially see in the photo, but then did and still wanted it. it has a nice drape and is comfortable and flattering. my only critique is that it comes up a little shorter on my torso than i expected. i am a medium/size 8 with 34d bust and the top comes to maybe 2 inches below my belly button. i think it's still flattering and comfortable,
318	1	a	"This dress is gorgeous! i absolutely love the embroidery. a note about the sizing- while the top portion fits snugly, the hip section runs slightly big. i was surprised to find that the 4 i ordered looked baggy, so i went into the store to try a 2, but the 0 was the best fit! however i'm small-chested (and 5'6"" 113lbs), so i was able to go with the 0 as it fit the hips much better. if you're a bustier type though, the top may be tight. other than the tricky sizing, it's perfect."
319	2	a	I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great, soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.
320	1	a	I originally bought this dress in another color back when retailer was doing the 25% off dresses promotion a few months ago. i had seen it on a store associate at my local store and absolutely loved it, but hemmed and hawed at the original price. it was a splurge even at 25% off, but as soon as i put it on i was in love. this dress is so soft. i wore it to see some old friends, and after every hug i received a comment about how unbelievably soft it was! the material is thick enough to have a decen
321	4	a	I ordered the gold in size xl. it fits true to size, matching the online photos. the color & details are prettier in person. such a comfortable tee. it's washed/dried well too. i hope they make more colors for this fall. it's been a great basic!
322	1	a	I'm 5'6 and between 100-105lbs. buying clothes from retailer is always a stuggle because i have a petite frame but i don't fall into the petite height range. i usually order a petite size and just deal with the shorter length, which is hard when you're all limbs. i purchased a 0r and i'm in love with the fit! the top of the dress fits under my arms perfectly! the waist of the dress also hits nicely. usually the waist of regular sized dresses falls below my natural waistline due to my short
323	1	a	"The design/pattern balances broader shoulders/narrower hips and gives my straighter waist definition.  at 5'1"", size 2 ended mid-knee, but overall felt a little too long (torso length). i normally take 0p or 00p in retailer dresses.  i like the feel of the fabric and the overall playful yet chic look."
324	1	a	"I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me, but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great, but even though my boobs are of ""mostly"" equal size, they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:("
325	0	a	I tried a pair of the hyphen chinos on at retailer and loved them. they are comfortable and a great casual look. i bought two more pairs in different colors on line.
326	0	a	I seriously love this skirt! i bought it for my college graduation and i was complimented by everyone that saw it. not only that, but it is beyond versatile, you can dress it up, make it casual, or make it professional. it is extremely ideal especially for the price. it also is the most comfortable skirt i've ever worn, so that's a plus.
327	0	a	I'm very picky about jumpers, and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have, i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast, don't wait for it to go on sale! (seriously my store is already out of xs's)
328	4	a	I love this t shirt and have not purchased it in all 3 colors. very soft and very flattering!!! i like the longer length as well as the pretty neckline.
329	2	a	"This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (5'2""). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it!"
330	3	a	"I ordered xs petite. which they are sold out of. but in case you are a different size i wanted to write a review. i'm 5 feet tall and 120 lbs. i am 34  d so busty. the petite did not overwhelm me. the pockets do open. you're supposed to cut the little threads out. ask a dry cleaner or an retailer stylist for help. i like that there is a little ""stiffness"" to the cape. it has holes for your arms. not a poncho. your lucky if they have your size!"
331	1	a	"Easter ??mother's day tea??baby shower?? i'm 5'2"" 120# and ordered a 4p. true to size. beautifully made, flowy, feminine. i can't wait to wear this!"
332	1	a	"I just bought this nice dress on sale as i love the dolan brand and purchased my regular size small (34/27/35) and it fits me perfect so i'd say it runs tts. the material is nice and soft, not see through at all and a good length (i'm 5'4""). i bought the regular and didn't seem to need a petite. it's a slimming dress that's not overly tight too. i also really like the mock neck and don't find it constricting at all as the material has a bit of stretch. the short sleeves will be nice when it's sp"
333	4	a	I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu
334	1	a	"I am 5'2"", 120lbs. and bought the 4 petite, which is what i normally wear, and it fits perfectly. the quality of the fabric and stitching is good, not great, and more what i would expect to see in a less expensive garment, but for me, the style, the fit and the fact that it doesn't seem to show wrinkles, at least not before washing, turned it in to a keeper for me. the drawstring ties in the back and i find it a little weird when you wear a belt with it. i tried the ada belt with it, but found i"
335	4	a	"Bought the gray online just to try it and i've already worn it 3 times! very soft, love the flowiness, and the scoop in the back gives it a slightly less casual touch without losing comfort. the only concern i have is that it may pill up a little and not sure how it will hold up in the wash. i'm 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the size small was perfect (true to size)."
336	1	a	I wanted a casual but special summer dress and had high hopes for this one. i normally like to try things on as it is difficult to tell fit online. when it arrived i was disappointed with this dress. it is very full in the skirt, the top fit a bit odd, not a lot of shape and not especially flattering. the fabric wasn't very exciting either.  unfortunately this one went back.
337	1	a	Bought this dress for a wedding in petite. fits true to size. beading & embroidery is beautiful in person. only downside is that the beads & embroidery are very delicate and damage even when sitting on a chair.
338	2	a	"These pants are amazingly soft and comfortable. they can be worn with cute flats and a dressier top/accessories to work or with a simple tee or tank with tennies for running errands or lounging around. these are great for multiple seasons. i'm 5'2 so they are a little long but the ruched ankle makes that look by ""by design""."
339	4	a	This green sweater is solo pretty . i wanted it from the moment i saw it. pretty layers on the bottom make it so unique!
340	4	a	This is just okay for me. the top is soft and surprisingly flattering, especially from the side, but the front rides up and the neckline never lays flat. it washes well and the tan/white combo is cute, but a little transparent.
341	4	a	What can i say? it's like wearing a hug. it's so wonderful i have a hard time taking it off at the end of the day! it's extraordinarily soft and thick, and stylish to boot! the one thing is that the thread holding the pockets together was already coming unraveled when i took it out of the package, and i had to sew them back on right away, as they were starting to come completely apart. a small price to pay for being a new owner of the best thing ever.
342	0	a	I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.
343	0	a	I wasn't sure how to rate the fit on these. i tried my normal 12 and the waist fit pretty well- but there's a lot of room in the hip/pelvis area. i tried a 10 but the waist didn't fit. i can see these gathering when i sit- but i just love the print. there is no stretch in these, either. i have slim legs- if you don't, i would size up or just pass. the calf is tight.
344	4	a	Great tank! i really like the black and white striped one! very versatile .
345	4	a	"I loved the color and the neckline was flattering. however, it would have fit me better in a petite size bc i am 5'3"" and a 32f. it fits slim so to fit in my bust it was too long. also didn't think the fabric was good quality for this price."
346	0	a	Pilcro has my heart! their cut and style are perfect for me - no more squeezing into skinny jeans! dear retailer, please always sell pilcro and maeve brands - they are amazing!
347	4	a	I love this top so much i bought it in 3 colors. the material is so soft and comfortable. has a slight fitting in the waist to make it very flattering. you can wear the next as pictured or button it up and slouch it and it looks great both ways. perfect with jeans or dress it up with slacks. just wish it wasn't dry clean only.
348	1	a	Love the color of this dress, however found it a little boxy, and the arms are too tight. i ordered up a size ( m) which is probably why it is boxy and i can hardly get it over my arm, i am very athletic. probably should have sent it back.
349	4	a	"I was expecting an ivory/white cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit. i am 138 lbs, 36b and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m. the sweater is at least 1 or 2 sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fit.  the lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them. also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes. not unpleasant but not as pictured. as"
350	1	a	"I ordered the small and it fits ok,i probably could have went with an xs but i am keeping the dress.it is a very beautiful dress.this dress can be worn for casual or dressed up for evening.very versatile dress and well made.i did get it on sale which made it very affordable. i am only 5'3"" and the length in the regular s is fine for me."
351	1	a	This was all wrong on me. the puffy sleeves made me look a foot wider. i'm thinking this will look good on tall slim ladies. it is extremely comfortable and the material is very pretty though. tts
352	4	a	When i received this blouse, ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however, after hanging on my closet door, the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.
353	4	a	I ordered this in two sizes and have only received one so far, but i think i really like it. that said, the one i got weirdly has pockets not shown in the images, which makes it seems more professorial than i'd prefer, partly because i am a professor and don't want to dress like one if i can help it. that said, i really need a floppy, easy cardigan, and this might well be it.
354	4	a	The shirt is nice, but not as nice a material as i was hoping, but i kept it anyway. but after washing it, it is even more disappointing, not very soft and now kind of an odd length. hopefully it will grow on me, but wouldn't recommend it especially for the price.
355	0	a	"This is adorable! i got it to wear on the plane for an upcoming vacation. this is definitely tts. i am normally a medium and got the medium. i am long wasted and this fit just fine. looks like it does on the model. the material is super soft too. it is also easy to get on and off which is sometimes difficult with rompers. plan on wearing it with gladiator sandals and a jean jacket."
356	3	a	I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also, it's pretty short, and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people.
357	4	a	This is a super cute top that is a fit and flare design. i think the stylists wanted it to look more straight hence the odd model shots, but this definitely has a flare to it. it also has pockets. it feels a bit artsy to me which isn't normally my style, but the pink and white is just very feminine and pretty. i would say it probably runs a little large because of the style, but i have larger arms, so, the arms were a bit snug in my normal size, but i didn't want to go up in size as the rest fit
358	5	a	This is such an ethereal flowing dress.more gray than light blue as it appears in pix.love the flowy bell sleeves.its a modest length just above the knee.quality a bit lower than is the retailer norm but still good.
359	2	a	"Adorable! great for yoga or everyday use. can even fit a strapless bra under with no showing(i purchased the black). i'm 5'4"", usually a 6-8 and it fit great."
360	2	a	"I just got this suit in and i was pretty excited about it, however it does not have lined cups like it says. no boob support whatsoever, though i think the pattern distracts enough that i'm keeping it anyways. (34dd). i do think it might be too short for a taller person. i'm only 5'4"" and it just barely comes up high enough to cover me, and i don't think big boobs are the reason. also it is pretty cheeky, which it does mention. maybe a little expensive, but i did use a coupon."
361	4	a	This is a great tee.... i bought this in the green in a size m. i'm normally a small but because of the fitted look, i opted for the medium. i probably could have sized down to the small, but the medium is still fitted just not too tight, which is actually a nice look. the only thing i wish was different are the sleeves. the sleeves are just a little too puffy for me, but it's so cute that i'm keeping it.
362	0	a	I got the moss and love the color. the style and size in 31p is perfect for my short self. very comfy for work. now, i need more colors...
363	4	a	"This sweater/tunic is lovely - soft, just enough structure in the top to not look like a sack, pretty color. i ordered the ""raspberry"" which is definitely more of a ""burnt orange-red"" to my eye. i understand what another reviewer was referring to regarding quality. the fabric just doesn't feel very substantial or strong. i have a feeling this might not last too long and it's a shame at this price point. i'd love to order another color but will definitely wait for sale. it's office appropriate an"
364	1	a	This dress just feels and looks amazing. i love how it isn't too short like a lot of new styles. i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter. i also love the plaid cuff detail. the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced. i got home and realized one button was missing. i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms, 2 buttons popped off!
365	2	a	"This is a very well made swimsuit with soft foam cups and fully lined. the shoulders stay put with thin strips of foam that are sewn in. very comfortable and easy to move in; my arms have full range. the color is like the online photo, and to the teal close-up i posted of the shoulder area. . the size 'm' that i ordered fit my bust very well with smooth lines and decent support. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37, 30d / 32c bra, with a average to long torso with a full bottom and thighs. i think the"
366	2	a	"I managed to find this huit eden lagoon fixed straps foam bandeau swimsuit in a size 32c and it fits perfectly. my current measurements are 33-25-37 or 38 hips, and i normally wear a 30d or 32c bra. . i have a longish torso, yet this doesn't ride up. fits like on the model. there is a thin strip of silicone around the back to keep it from sliding down. the v-shape is held by a hard wire, but it doesn't cut in anywhere. the soft black straps are sewn in and not adjustable but do hold their shap"
367	1	a	I really wanted to love this dress. the pattern is so much prettier in person. i typically wear a medium, sometimes a large in tops. the medium in this dress was too tight in my chest; the large fit my chest but was ridiculously large in other areas. the front of the dress goes up pretty high (for someone with a large chest) and flows down. there is a tie in the back but it doesn't do much to help with the shape in the front.
368	4	a	Awesome top. slightly cropped. great to dress up jeans or wear with pants or skirt for evening out.
369	4	a	Love this top! bought it in the relish color - loved it so much bought the green too! usually wear a small but the medium was perfect.
370	1	a	Love this dress. purchased in white. runs true to size. made well.
371	1	a	"I bought this dress for a trip to the caribbean and really enjoyed wearing it. i was worried it might look like a ""sack"" but i think it is both slimming and flattering. i love the interesting neckline and rolled up sleeves!! a winner."
372	1	a	I got this dress in navy for my engagement photos and i got so many compliments on the design and fit of the dress. it's very comfortable and stretchy so i got a 6 petite and it fit perfectly, where normally i need an 8 or a 10 because clothes are made so tight now. it was light weight and fit great in the bust and fell nicely over the hips. and for the bottom of the dress being white, it surprisingly wasn't see through. i wouldn't go wearing bright red under the dress but there is definitely no
373	5	a	This skirt is gorgeous. i'm glad i saw it in-store as the picture online does not do it justice. the colors are really rich and the pattern has a sentimental, vintage feeling. it also has pockets and a great, glamorous swing to it. this skirt is great for work with a blouse and heels and also looks awesome with a t-shirt tucked in and sandals. the fabric has a really nice four season weight, i think it will also look great with high boots and a turtleneck in the autumn. i get so many compliments
374	0	a	Love these pants! super comfortable, but feel high quality. i am usually a size 2 and the xs fits perfectly.
375	0	a	I really like this romper and i ordered it to fit my bottom. i'm a 6 on the bottom and 4 up top. i ordered a mp to cover the bottom and a petite for my height. it's a keeper but i will be belting or adding something to cinch it at the waist so that it has more of a shape.
376	0	a	I had never worn pilcro jeans, and i took a chance and ordered without trying them on. i couldn't be more pleased! i wear a 26, but it is often difficult to find a good fitting pair of jeans. these fit comfortably and don't feel too tight, but are fitted enough to look great. i like the little bit of extra room around the top, allowing the jeans to feel comfortable. i'll be back for more pilcro jeans!
377	0	a	This is a great pair of trousers for work but can also be dressed down. they are very flattering and runs true to size. they're also a bit highwaisted which i love. my only complaint is that they are unlined. i'm not sure why a nice pair of wool trousers would be unlined. however i'm still giving them 5 stars because the fit and quality outweigh the one con.
378	1	a	I purchased the navy size small and was delighted with the fit. the waist line is perfectly proportioned for a petite. i think this means that the waist line will be high on a woman who needs regular sizing. i like the lining, it adds a substantial look to the dress.
379	1	a	I got this dress in coral and i absolutely fell in love with it the moment i tried it on. the fabric is very soft and flows nicely. i am 5'3 and i got it in regular but the length is not too long or short. i can probably wear it with my flip flops.
380	1	a	This dress is adorable - it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced, in my opinion). the tie detail is somewhat adjustable, and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7, 128#). where this gets me is the fact that it's dry clean...totally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer. i might bring it back for that alone, since i originally planned to wear it a lot. :(
381	4	a	When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?
382	4	a	Very comfy and light. can be casual with jeans and boots or dress it up with a nice necklace and pencil skirt.
383	1	a	I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different, but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top, the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.
384	1	a	I absolutely love this dress! the fabric is very light and airy while not being revealing. the color, being nude as indicated, is a nice change from plain white or off white and the embroidery is just beautiful and makes this dress quite unique. i love the fact that it is a tunic dress which lends to less of a structured look and more of an easy casual style. i recently wore this dress to an out door bbq and was both cool and comfortable all day. i also received many compliments from friends and
385	4	a	A great basic t, so very much cuter than most. i have black and white both and wish it came in more colors.
386	1	a	This dress is absolutely amazing! i am an retailer addict, a good portion of my wardrobe is from retailer. that being said, this is one of my all time favorite purchases! this dress is a beautiful statement. i am tall and curvy and this dress fits like a glove but is very comfortable. the quality of the beading and the fabric is very good. i wore it on my hawaii vacation, and got numerous compliments! don't pass this one up! five stars!
387	1	a	This dress is very pretty, versatile and high quality! i'm planning to wear it to a wedding. with the holiday season coming up, i will definitely get to use it as well. the fabric is very comfortable especially the top part; it's very soft. i usually wear an xs petite, this dress seems to be a liiiiiittle too long for me and the waist is a tiny bit too loose from how i like it but it's manageable. (i have this dress in ivory top)
388	4	a	I ordered size large in the denim color and tops like this are the reason i shop at retailer. this is such a sweet little floral, vertical, slimming, goes with anything print. the buttons down the front close with loops. it's easy to unbutton a few and pull this over your head. i'm a busty 34g and there's no gapping or pulling. the shirt arrived with the sleeves rolled and i had a heck of a time getting those tiny buttons into the cuff but once in, the cuff is wide enough to just slip your arm thr
389	4	a	"I bought this online days before my trip to seattle. i read the reviews so was aware it runs large...and it does. i practically lived in it the whole time i was there. it's very comfortable and once it cools down here in so cal i'll be back in it. some reviewers mentioned it bunched up when tied but didn't like the ties hanging loose. i just looped each one and it works great.  it really runs large. i bought their smallest size and had ample room."
390	5	a	"It is seldom that i write a review about a tee, but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today, i just felt compelled to do so! the deal is, this tee is pricey for sure, but in my opinion, it is worth it! as another reviewer said, the cotton fabric is hefty; in fact, it could also be called a ""lightweight sweater."" everything about this tee is perfect and classic: the elbow sleeves, the nice neckline, and the semi-boxy, semi-cropped fit. it will go with everything from jeans, to nice slacks"
391	1	a	Nice loose-fitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall. i had no problem with the slip being too tight. 5'3'', 118lbs, and went with my normal size 2. it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders. it's great with boots or flats!
392	1	a	"I wanted to love this dress so much, but unfortunately it ran way too big for my taste. i am usually a 4/6 in retailer, and the small was huge on me. the bottom half of the dress is very much a ""swing"" dress and is very wide, much wider than it looks in the pictures. i suppose that sizing down (maybe even to a petite), and having the dress altered to be narrower on the bottom half would've made it look like the picture, but that's a lot of extra work for a dress that is already pretty pricey."
393	1	a	Looks great, the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!
394	1	a	This is my favorite kind of neckline. it is very flattering & cool for summer. my only complaint is the armpit scoops down a little too low. but i will just wear a bandeau underneath it. its super cute. will be great for vacationing & next summer.
395	4	a	I was just at the store and purchased this cute top which runs tts for me. i wasn't expecting to find anything at the store but the beautiful lace and adorable tie at the front caught my eye so i bought the small which is my usual size at retailer (34d-27-35) and it fits perfectly. the material is a touch thin but that's okay with me since i don't want heavy clothes for the warmer months anyway. i also don't find this top particularly see through as it's black and will wear a full coverage bra wit
396	2	a	These tights have a nice pattern and color. they look just like the photograph. they are warm and because they are warm they have wool in them and they are a little itchy. but, that's the price you pay for warmth. i own several pairs of retailer tights and love the patterns (foxes, scotty dogs, and now trees). .
397	4	a	Pretty! can't wait to wear this in the fall. design is understated yet pretty. nice poncho:swing style. haven't worn it yet so i can't rate the durability or wash experience yet. glad i got this on sale!
398	5	a	I liked this coat but my family said it looked too much like something hilary clinton would wear. i am 54 and i think it made me look a bit dowdy since it runs a bit big.
399	4	a	"I am 5'8"" and about 145 lbs - curvy through hips, small up top and i got a small and it fit great. i got it in the wine and it is a pretty color for fall into winter. the fabric is super soft and cozy!"
400	4	a	I was on a mission at retailer to find a versatile and comfortable jacket/cardigan. this is perfection. the detail and pattern in the wool make it unique and the zipper and snaps are great quality. i bought it in the green and is great for the office and out in jeans as well.
401	4	a	"I usually wear a size small in deletta. i am 5'5"" and 140 pounds. the small ran true to size for me. saying that i am a size 8 so usually everywhere else i can take small or medium, so i can see how reviewers say it runs big. love the ruffles on this tank. makes it a little more special. super comfy and easy to wear. will be great for hot summer days in florida!"
402	0	a	I wear a 10/12. i bought a 30/31 and they fit perfect in every way! they were even almost too long so i can wear with heels if i want. i am so glad i bought these. don't let the folded cuff in the picture deceive you. a great pair of straight leg jeans!
403	4	a	This sweater is pretty, fits tts, feels soft against the skin and has a good weight to it so cami is absolutely not needed. i particularly like the buttons on the side. you could unbutton to have the sweater feel more swingy and show more of the underlayer. the design in the back is simple and flattering for all figures, i think. this shade of gray is also appealing to me as it's not too light or dark and has a hint of periwinkle undertone to it. the sweater is on the shorter side but i do think
404	4	a	Love the way this top fits. got many compliments on it! wish the arm holes were a little closer fit - can see the bra peeking out a teensy bit.
405	4	a	The sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area. i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately. it truly is a great tank top!
406	3	a	I wanted to like this coat so bad! i loved the bright red color and design, but when i received it, it seemed very cheap and just too large. i returned it.
407	4	a	This shirt is so comfortable, soft, and super cute. definitely recommend!
408	4	a	Absolutely beautiful!! quality is worth it...i agree with other review and also sized down from large to medium for a more fitted look ....the color is gorgeous..lighter shade of brown...so thrilled material does not contain dreaded wool lol!
409	5	a	"I like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous. it's seriously unflattering. i usually between a m & a l and i got a small and it's still massive. but the slip is tiny.   it looks so cute in the picture. but not good in person."
410	1	a	I loved this dress when i saw it online, perfect for a summer wedding, but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely, it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly, it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.
411	4	a	This sweatshirt is extremely comfy and stylish. i am happy with the item and it runs a snag large but perfect for a sweatshirt.
412	4	a	Love this top. comfy, soft, and a great length. slightly longer in the back, and works great with leggings or jeans. i love that is has long sleeves. i wish it came in more colors.
413	4	a	"Tried and pictured the regular size small. my stats are 34/35a-28-36 and i usually wear a 6 or an 8 on top in shirts and blazers. the small here was nicely loose so it might run a bit big. in person, the colors are dark navy on light beige. lovely heavy weight cotton and stitching. i think it's deliberately a bit short, hit at my hip (i'm 5'6"") but i like this. the 3/4"" sleeves are a bit nowhere for me...i wish they were full length but that's my only quibble."
414	4	a	I adore this little sweater- the pictures don't do it justice. i'm tall, with broad shoulders and small chest- the cut and design of this sweater is so flattering. colors work with denim or any neutral, and the weight is perfect for spring or early summer.
415	3	a	This oversized coat is fabulous! i've received so many compliments on it.
416	4	a	"Stylist at my local retailer recommended i try on this top. as soon as i put it on, i was amazed at how pretty it is. i'm 5'3"" and curvy size medium and the fit is true to size. i would say if you are between sizes, you may want to size down. i didn't have any issues with the lace and the slight v-neck falls perfectly on me. no need to wear any cami.  my only concern was how wrinkled the top was. i requested to have the blouse steamed before i left the store so that i could see if all of the wrin"
417	4	a	This definitely works for you - think fabric, great quality, and i'm 25 weeks and i think i'll be able to use this to the end. got my normal-ish size. would never have kept this if i wasn't pregnant, cause you can definitely accommodate a pregnancy (or maybe go down two sizes if not). this is not my first baby either! love for my pregnancy.
418	5	a	"This is a beautiful and versatile skirt. i love the layered detail, length, and flattering cut.   the fabric is a 80% cotton/20% linen blend. it's a thick weave with tiny nubs here and there. the skirt was made in turkey.  i usually wear a size 4 in retailer skirts, but i sized down to a 2 in this skirt. the size 2 fit at my natural waist and looked as pictured on the model, whereas the 4 looked bulkier on me,"
419	1	a	I just love this dress - so comfortable and flattering. maeve has had some great dresses this summer, but this one may be my favorite. this one could easily been worn in to fall with a sweater or jacket.
420	1	a	"Saw this dress in the blue motif and thought it would be perfect for a summer outdoor wedding. i'm 5'4"" 125 lbs and ordered a size 2. it fit true to size in the shoulders, bust and length, but did not fit as pictured on the site; it looks in the pictures like there is some shape to the waistline without being too fitted, which i like. on me there was absolutely no shape. it just billowed and looked really maternity. 15 bucks for alterations to take in the sides and now it's my favorite darn thin"
421	2	a	"I love workout dresses and skirts. i sport them in both yoga (if they have an under layer of shorts, obviously) and in high cardio classes-as well as for things like tennis. i like the extra breeze a dress/skirt will get you, and find them to be really comfortable. i really like this dress as it is not a super bold color (it is hard to find workout attire that is not neon colored). i prefer things to be a little more relaxed and less ""look at me"" like when i am working out. this dress is flatter"
422	1	a	This dress is very pretty but only the bottom is lined. the top is completely see through and you would need to wear a tank or slip underneath. i wanted a dress i could just throw on and not have to layer so it didm't work for me. but if you don't mind layering or your bra peeking through, it's still a very beautiful dress. i'm usually a petite in most things but this wasn't available in p so i ordered an xs. the length was good (not too long, not too short) but it was cut way too low for me. on
423	4	a	Great fit and very cute design. goes great with jeans.
424	4	a	I love this poncho!! it's perfect for chilling saturday mornings at the soccer field. it's a nice warm layer, but doesn't get to hot. pair it with a long sleeve shirt, jeans and some boots and you're set.
425	4	a	"So i recommend wearing with something more fitted, or with a flare (jeans), or tucked in like the picture. i love the detail of hte polka dot on the sleeves and collar (inside), so if you leave the collar open or roll the sleeves up a bit, you see hte contrast. it is a bit short, and i am petite, i ended up with regular size anyway otherwise, it may have been too short.  colors are nice, and i love the material, it is very soft and hoepfulyl warm (my orffice is freezing). should ahve grabbed it"
426	1	a	I don't understand the negative reviews on this dress. i absolutely love the fit, may be the prior reviewer was trying a size on that was too large? yes, the fabric and the snaps are very delicate so you have to be careful putting it on and off, but the fit is very flattering on most people. i saw three different people trying it on in the fitting room today so i decided to try it on myself and had to have it! the colors are beautiful and the uneven hem makes it more fun and young. i will wear i
427	1	a	"I am a fan of these designers and their gorgeous fabrics - most of which are heavy brocades. this is so pretty and fun. the print is playful, and colors are gorgeous, and the fit is floaty but not too full or too tight. i love the bit of beading, and that i can dress it up or down.  i am petite and not usually a bigger print or long dress fan, but i know that i will wear this one for years.   i did get a 00 petite as i know that only this small size fits me at retailer - 0's swallow me. this i"
428	4	a	Great top for the older woman who wants to be stylish but needs a little extra room. the subtle color goes with anything. i love it!!
429	1	a	This is one of my favorite retailer dresses - it's flowy and makes me feel beautiful. i loved it so much that i bought it in two colors! it does run big, so i would size down but when you find your size, you'll love it!
430	4	a	Deep purple keeps it fall, flower design keeps it feminine, pockets make it fun! love it and can't wait to wear it.
431	4	a	"Runs really large. i am 5'4"", 120lbs, 32c, and had to exchange xs for xxs for width, but then the sleeves were a little tight. decided to keep the xxs in white."
432	2	a	I have to be honest, i wear this away from the pool more than to the pool. it is extremely lightweight and comfortable, making it the perfect loungewear to tackle this california heat, and the style is fabulous- love the hassles and beads on the ties.
433	4	a	I'm not entirely sure if this shirt just runs large or if it fits oddly/boxy. the flowered material puffs out on the sides a couple of inches under my arms... i'm usually a pretty solid size medium, but i think i'm going to try to exchange this for a small to see if that solves that weird fit issue, because it is a nice idea of a design and comfortable overall. but, if that doesn't solve the trick, if not recommend, b/c that side puffiness isn't flattering.
434	0	a	I'm a size 4 all day everyday. but, these pants wouldn't even meet around my hips. sadly, i'm returning them tomorrow.
435	0	a	"I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece, and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear, but for me, there were a few challenges.  first, the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style, cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th"
436	1	a	"I am 5'9"" and 138 pounds slender, but with a tummy. the small fit great ,and i agree with the other reviewer that the elastic waist band is complimentary. the dress flounces out a little, but in a cute way, and it's not too short compared to so many other baby doll dresses out there now. i didn't think it looked that great on the hanger, but when i tried it on it looked so much better than i expected. got the brown. thank you to the other reviewers for the bootie, boot, moto jacket transition to"
437	0	a	I really wanted this. they had two size small in my local retailer, both were damaged. so disappointing. i don't want to pay shipping for one that hopefully isn't damaged:( in the last year i've had multiple quality control issues with retailer. makes me gun shy. not sure i'm getting what i pay for anymore.
438	4	a	I loved this but didn't realize it has mohair which agitated my contacts. i had to return it. if you don't have that problem, this goes great with leggings or jeans.
439	0	a	I ordered these without reading the previous reviews and i would have to agree with everything everyone has already said. these are the cutest cords i've seen in a long time! they're definitely skinny, bridging on way too skinny through the calves but i'm willing to stick it out. the thing that bugs me about them is how stinking short they are?? the description doesn't really mention that they're crops but at this length any ankle bootie is going to be too short. also, they aren't navy. they're
440	4	a	"I love this sweater. i found it in the sale section a few weeks ago but wasn't sure if it would be too bulky. it had a dark smudge on the collar left from someone or something. i thought maybe it had been left behind by others for that reason because the quality was so nice. thankfully, i washed it and the smudge came out.    i live in houston, tx and don't need to wear wool or cashmere sweaters for warmth. this is mostly cotton. it is well made. the sleeves were longer on me than the model,"
441	4	a	I tried this shirt on on a whim in my local store when i was there to shop the sale items an to my surprise, it was very flattering and comfortable. it had a unique fit and design; i tried on the black in an xs (my usual size) and surprisingly, i didn't find it to be too big at all. it fit just like it did on the model. you could almost wear it as a mini dress over leggings/shorts based on the length. like one of the previous reviewers, it would be great if it came in other colors. this top woul
442	4	a	Super soft flannel material. the colors are beautiful and perfect for fall! it's doesn't ride up the shoulders but stays in place off-the-shoulder style. i love it!
443	0	a	I love this piece and have bought it for three different clients as well as myself... it runs a size larger - i am usually a 4 and the 2 fits perfectly. the skort was one size off for my clients too. definitely a great choice for spring/summer, especially if you love to dress up but lead an active lifestyle!
444	4	a	Walked in intending to purchase another jacket and ended up leaving with this one. the color is advertised as grey, but it's actually more like a light mocha. the slightly darker fabric on the side and around the waist accentuated my curves and i believe it would help give the illusion of an hourglass figure to those who are more straight and slender. i generally wear a size 12 and m or l size tops depending on the designer. i purchased the l in this case because that's all that was available at
445	4	a	"This top is beautifully made and designed. material is soft and comfortable however it's very boxy. the details on the side stick out. i just found it not very flattering for me."
446	4	a	This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.
447	3	a	This vest is much silkier than the pictures online show, which was a great surprise. the cut of this vest is beautiful and it can be worn so many ways!
448	4	a	You know how you look in your closet and things just say i'm perfect for today. this top is like that. i got it a few weeks ago and have worn it often because it is so easy and hangs really nice. i bought the black one and am considering the off white one.
449	4	a	"This sweater is perfect! finally a sweater that doesn't make me look like a huge box!  i bought the blue & it has other colors running through it so i'll be able to wear it with chinos & jeans. very pretty, flattering & i think i'm going to be wearing this a lot."
450	0	a	This skirt is great! the fabric is so soft and light. i was hoping that the lower portion of the skirt wouldn't be too transparent, and it wasn't. the slip lining on the upper portion of the skirt is nice. the color is exactly as shown. i followed the advice of the only reviewer and sized up... i shouldn't have! the skirt was too big in the waist and too long. so i exchanged and the fit was right on. i think the skirt is meant to sit a little higher on the waist, so keep that in mind. the only t
451	1	a	I love the way the dress fit definitely a flip flop by the poolside bar dress. i ordered the mango colored one and was disappointed that the color resembled a dark squash orange and not as bright as it looked in picture. i think it will look nice with a tan so i will keep it. wouldn't plan to dress it up too much because it will definitely wrinkle ! i am a petite 5'4 and got the regular and it fits just above my knees which is good for my taste!
452	1	a	"I went to my local retailer store on saturday to pick up some new cute things that i had my eye on. after collecting the items i came in for i saw this romper! i tried it on and it was 'amazing""  comfortable , soft and so versatile!!! bonus!!! i left so tremendously happy!! it will be a win for  many years to come!!!!!!!!!!!"
453	4	a	"So i tried on the regular size in the store, and love the top, but looked too big on me.  color is gorgeous and rich, the sheer adds a little whimsical to it, and i love the tie-neck trend of lately. would go nicely with jeans (skinny or flare) or trousers, not sure about a skirt though,."
454	0	a	In nature pilco fashion, these jeans are amazing. i wear them rolled down, they have a slight boot cut, but not overly. i am 5'10 and the bottoms fall right to my heel- meaning the hem doesn't drag on the ground-finally the perfect pair of jeans. they also do not stretch out and keep shape after wearin all day! highly recommend, although a little pricy for pilcro, worth the splurge.
455	4	a	"So bummed. i was really hoping this top would work for me. i got the black in regular size 4 and the pink in petite size 4. both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section. i have a sort of short torso, wear a small 34c, and am have a defined waist. when tops are bulky, it gives me no shape and just looks terrible. i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure. they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out. the constr"

457	4	a	I ordered the purple color and the first time i wore it, i received multiple compliments on it.  i noticed in the prior reviews that it runs big so i ordered an extra small instead of my usual small.  it fits well other than the two buttons at the top of the neck are very small and difficult to button.  i'm tempted to order the red color.
458	4	a	Beautiful sweater, unique knit mix and i love the color, but the fabric is too itchy. i was wearing a long sleeve dress underneath but the yarn was prickling my arms, bum and thighs.  colorblock patchwork arrangement made me look extra top hefty and emphasized my trouble spots (upper back/arms).  i ordered lp but it was too large so would recommend staying tts.
459	4	a	A lovely, creatively designed tunic that just isn't for me.  the embroidery is certainly intricate and the chambray shirt has a wearable hand, but the combination on my body type didn't look quite right, probably because i am too top heavy and apple torsoed.  i think if i were more slender, the fit would look like a flattering dress.  i had purchased the size 10 and i am 36dd 140#.
460	4	a	I have this in another color and it is my absolute fav! transform any outfit! it has an over-sized fit.
461	4	a	I like the cut and look of this shirt, and tried on the xs (fits 115 lbs, 30ss chest), but i find that the t-shirts lately are kind of thin and see through... the shirt is fun, and the color is adorable, but had to pass as i could see my bra too clearly for my liking.
462	1	a	I am still in love with my ribboned denim dress from earlier this year. so, when i saw this dress i was super excited and ordered it right away in the same size. it just came and... i'm kinda disappointed. the fit is... shrunken?? kind of like i'm wearing a petite size. it's around 3 to 4 inches shorter, the tie at the waist hits instead right under my bust, and there's some weird bunching happening above my rear?? i kept wanting to pull the whole dress down more, but that's just the way it was
463	4	a	I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list. i'm so happy with it. its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3). the pattern on the front is very flattering.
464	3	a	This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews, but it was way too big. sadly, i had to return it.
465	1	a	"I wore this dress for the first time yesterday... i have never received so many compliments on a dress before! several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was! it is an absolute must-have!"
466	3	a	"I was looking for a stylish spring/fall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill. i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket. i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me. i can't wear it enough! i am a short 5'2"" but 36d and have 31"" waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best. as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room! i am normally a 12/14 so i was surprised by this. if you are on the"
467	0	a	"These jeans fit great, but i think getting the right size is key. i bought my usual denim size 26 and at first i thought they were too tight. but as the day wore on, they softened and conformed to my body and fit like a glove. if i bought them in a larger size, i'm afraid they'd bag out like jeans tend to do. i think it's the ""legging"" style that makes them so form fitting. i wish they were ankle length like on the model, but i'm 5'5"" and they are quite a bit longer on me than the model."
468	0	a	I'm normally a size 25p. i bought these in a 26 because i wanted a more relaxed fit. i could barely pull them up over my calves. i could get them on and button them, but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw. size up 2 sizes at least!
469	4	a	Very cute everyday tee. usually run between an xs or small with retailer and was happy i chose the extra small. a great updated on a classic strip tee.
470	1	a	The detail on this dress is lovely -- it's unusual and well-made from soft fabric. it is big though -- i would usually wear a medium and ordered a petite small. to give you a sense of how large it is, i am currently 33 weeks pregnant, and bought this to wear after the pregnancy. i can actually get it on now, over the considerable baby bump. it doesn't look good, but i can in fact get it on. hoping it won't be way too large post-pregnancy, but it seems to fit fine in the shoulders now. definitely
471	2	a	I love these pjs! i thought $100 for the set was a little too pricey for me but as soon as they went on sale i knew i had to have them! they are so light and fresh, perfect for the texas heat! it helps that the print is absolutely precious as well!
472	5	a	Mine came smelling like gasoline. not sure why, but i would have kept it otherwise. it's a smell that will be really hard to get out. looks like the picture.
473	0	a	Love this romper. fits perfectly, and looks like the picture. i'm 5 ft 7, 125 lbs, and usually am a size 4 or small. i ordered a small, and it fits beautifully. i've worn this a lot this summer in florida, and am getting a lot of compliments. don't be put of by the long sleeves for summer wear- the romper is loose enough and has a nice flow to it.
474	1	a	"Love at first sight (via the internet); upon arrival, i was on the fence. . the fabric is slinky and loose; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large (perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body). the lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms; every slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth; otherwise, when the arms are extended, the sleeves do hav"
475	4	a	"Perfect light weght sweater for the holidays. i love the detail in the back. the xs was a great fit for this 5'2"", 115 lb body."
476	4	a	"I loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets. the fabric was a nice weight, not too thin like lots of retailer tops. i liked the top from the front, however the back was way too long, especially with the looseness of the style. it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted. it might work on someone taller. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. and i tried xs."
477	4	a	"I saw this in the store today, tried on a small and a medium and a medium fit me better which is unusual. usually i am a small. this top is fitted around the chest and flowing at the bottom, a little longer than usual but the pattern is so pretty that i got it. i am 5'4"" 135 pounds and got a medium."
478	1	a	"I recommend this dress for people who do not have my body type. the dress is very comfortable and nicely designed. my torso is a bit barrel chested with a large bust so the fabric both wrapped and billowed out unattractively, causing the waistband to ride up and the skirt to pouf out over my tummy. if your body is more like the model, this is a flattering dress. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140# and ordered the medium petite. perhaps if i bought the non-petite version or sized down maybe it will"
479	1	a	This is a great dress for all body types. the fabric is substantial and soft.  i sized down for a closer fit, but i could have also bought my usual medium and had the extra space to belt it and wear a looser fit. i busted out the boots, a little early, and the outfit was done.  super easy to wear, dressed up or dressed down.  totally worth the price, i'm glad i didn't wait until it went on sale for fear of selling out.
480	4	a	"This top looks adorable in the product photos, so i had high hopes. i think i might be too short to pull it off, but like another reviewer said, i found it to be like a tent on me, billowing out in all directions. it was just overall too big on me--i even considered whether i could wear it as a dress, but the sleeves were also too billowy on me. i am 5'4"", 120 lbs and tried the xs."
481	1	a	I wanted so badly for this dress to work on me. the design is amazing. the detail is so pretty and delicate. its my version of the perfect little black dress! however i have very big arms...and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress, the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all. i'm usually a 14-16 in dresses. i tried the 16 and it just didn't work. the arms were way too tight. however i've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me, and they
482	5	a	Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful, but it also stops the material from stretching, so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also, they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger
483	4	a	"I bought this top in ivory and love it! i'm 5'5"" 125lbs and 32dd. i usually wear a small or 4 but sized up to a 6..i have no issues with the fabric!! this is a steal for the sale price."
484	0	a	This is going to be perfect for my daughter's graduation. she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her!
485	0	a	It does run a little small. my regular 2 fit but snug. the colors were drab and the material felt like straw. the lining is really silky and nice. just didn't work for me .
486	0	a	I am 5'5 about 110 lbs and the size 0 regular fits me well. sometimes i order petite, but the regular fit me just right. they are higher waisted than most pants i wear, but they are completely adorable and comfortable to boot. love the pattern. the sturdy quality is tangible. definitely going to order more of these pants in different patterns as they become available.
487	1	a	I bought the dress in black. it is very elegant with a fun flare, suits my taste. it does run a size too small like other reviewer mentioned. the material has no give at all. i couldn't breathe in my regular size. one size up fits like a glove. it is a perfect party dress to show your free and fun spirit!
488	1	a	Thank you to all of the reviewers who took the time to write a review. your reviews are what help me know exactly which size to order and how to know that i needed a regular instead of a petite. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a size 8 in retailer sizes. i went with a medium regular based on other reviews. thanks so much because the fit was perfect though still a little roomy.
489	0	a	"I love clothes, and my mom raised me to look for styles that are different, and unique. these pants are it! they fit beautifully, but run slightly big. i'm between a 4 and a 6, actually kept both. the 4 fits great in the hips and legs, plenty of room if you have curves (i do not), but it's a tad tight in the waist, if that helps. these are a perfect length, at 5' 7"" they hit above my ankle bone, and look perfect w a pointed, closed shoe. i love the colors, and am bored to death of black and grey"
490	4	a	Perfect denim top! the fabric/material is great and of good quality. there is a structure to the top, but it really makes the looks. the quality is amazing and the top can be styled in so many ways. for the quality, a definite must buy!
491	4	a	"I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it.   such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me."
492	2	a	"I love this sweatshirt. it's super chic and sexy (and for those of us that need actual support, it looks great with a strappy sports bra).  that said, selling this as ""one size fits all"" is misleading, at best.  i'm 5'2, ~160 (a lot of it muscle, but i enjoy chorizo), a 34ddd, and this fit me perfectly, but i can't imagine it would work for anyone much larger than a size 12.  just be real -- this is a smedium.   one star removed for the ""one size fits all"" fallacy."
493	1	a	"I tried the regular szie in store, like the cut, need petite though (too long and a lot of fabric) - i am 5'1.5"" and 115lbs... color, unfortunatly, looke aweful on my skin tone and washed me out. would need to be more red, the striping washed out the color nad dind't look flattering on me. the cut did, however.  so, if you ahge a good hur to your skin, good dress for you, if you are palelike me, i don't recommend...  ps love hte tie waist. picture not asflattering as on person."
494	5	a	I was so excited about this top, and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely, but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated, and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.
495	1	a	I ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner. i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height. i was for sure it would be too short in any other size. when i put it on i was drowning in it! i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal. has the potential to be super cute and flattering, yet the timing and sizing didn't work out. definitely give this one a try!
496	4	a	The sweater is comfortable and has a little 70s fabric flair...not quite as classically modern as it looks on the model. i am keeping it because it is a true fall/spring item. not a fabric weight for summer wear in california. the peach color is pretty muted, so it is not a show-stopping going-out piece.
497	1	a	Green- feminine and flattering, love this dress!!
498	4	a	This top is so flowy and has a great fit! i can see wearing it lots of different ways. it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down.
499	1	a	"This is a very cute dress! the sweater material is not itchy at all. i love the bell sleeve and how the seam at the top of the bell matches up to the waistline of the dress. good quality and well made. i am 5' 9"" tall and this dress falls just above my knees. so for me, it's the perfect length. i bought the black dress and i look forward to wearing it throughout the fall and winter."
500	1	a	"After multiple purchase and returns (from other sites!) i decided to splurge on a dress for my college graduation (located beach side). this dress was better than i could have hoped. the fit is very flattering, loose & tight in all the right places. the adjustable straps underneath the overlay ensure the silk lays perfectly. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light as a feather. the slight train & back buttons adds elegance to an otherwise ""casual"" floral pattern. i would highly recommend"
501	1	a	"Ordered the xsp (5'4"" about 118-120#, athletic build)...this was huge all over. big in the armholes, too much fabric hanging in the skirt (cream fabric) front and back, not flattering at all from the sides and as long on me as it shows on the model. i love the idea of this and for the right body type (of course) this will be beautiful. it also would not be a very versatile piece for me...the top sweater part is quite thick (lovely) and heavy. in oklahoma this would not work for very many weeks.."
502	4	a	"This brand always makes the softest tees, and so i buy several each season. when i saw this one online, i worried that it might be too long for my short waist, but i decided to order it anyway. success! i ordered my usual size m (for knit tops - 10/12 in fitted ones), and the length was perfect due to the buttons on the side. fyi: short waist, broad shoulders/back, 36c - i carry my weight in the middle, since i virtually do not have a waistline. so a longer, boxy tee will emphasize the parts of"
503	1	a	Cute dress but not for me.  the waist is too high and the sleeves are tight.  maybe on a different body type this dress would be perfect.  i returned it.
504	0	a	"I have been wearing joe's jean's for years and have a hefty stable of varieties in my wardrobe. recently, 3 pairs of their skinny leggings have worn out much quicker than expected which has caused me to question their construction and overall durability. i have had my eye on these pilco legging jeans for a while but every time i have gone to pull the trigger, my size has been sold out. finally, all the stars aligned just as i bid my final pair of joe's skinny's ""adieu"" and i was able to purchase"
505	4	a	I loved this top . it is exactly what i wanted,
506	4	a	I would suggest trying this on in store. the xs would've worked (that's my normal size), but i ended up preferring the s. it does have low armholes. the s in the yellow was just right for me, but the s in the navy was too low in the armholes and the shirt was cut a little crooked. still, a very cute and classic top that i know i'll get a lot of use out of.
507	2	a	"Ig and the first reviewer convinced me to buy this top. it was styled so beautifully with jeans and shorts on two different retailer associates, i wanted to see if i could pull it off too. unfortunately my body type and shortness makes the it look like i'm wearing short peasant skirt as a top.  really disappointed since the top is soft, beautiful, vibrant silk! maybe i will keep since i'm losing weight and will try it on again. generally i wear size m/l and i'm 5'3"" 135# 38-28-35. purchased this c"
508	4	a	A little more see-through than you would think, but has super cute smaller details! also needs to be ironed, a lot.
509	4	a	"I purchased this jacket in red. i have several boiled wool jackets from retailer and this one did not disappoint. it is very warm and appears to be high quality. it looks good both snapped and open. i do believe that it runs large. i settled on an xxs petite and am just under 5'4""."
510	4	a	"The metal detail @ the shoulders is the perfect touch to an otherwise ordinary tee.  regarding sizing. i am 5' 4"", 36dd and i usually have to buy l in tops and make alterations. after reading the other reviews i ordered a m & s. because my shoulders are narrow the s fit better. front measurement shoulder to hem is 24"" on both the s and the m. plenty of length for me. i also wasn't looking for a tight fit around the waist and tucking in just the front as shown on the model looks great. i saw thi"
511	3	a	"This is a very stylish and unique trench. it does run a bit large as i am usually a medium in jackets, but needed a small for this one. i am 5'2"" , 120 lbs., but with a large chest. i think it's very flattering. i have small hips, but the large pockets do not make me look bigger. it arrived very wrinkled, but i just touched it up with an iron. i think the color is more of a taupe-gray and will go with everything. love it!"
512	1	a	Very pretty dress, perfect style for my build, bigger busted, muffin top. the material/pattern is really pretty.
513	4	a	My daughter tried this on in the store yesterday and loved it. it fits perfectly; true to size - the quality of the fabric and style is lovely. a fun jacket to layer with.
514	1	a	Finally saw this dress online. i have to say that it looks better in person. the model might be too tall for this dress. i am 5'4''. it's right to my ankle. the color is in a nice off white. the material is a good quality. the overall cut is nice. it's a kind of classic feeling.you could wear it for a long time without going out of style.
515	4	a	True to size until it met the laundry! let my disappointment be a lesson -- $80 for a blouse that i no longer recognize. i washed this item as indicated by the care instructions and it shrunk by at least 30%. dry clean this garment, or spot clean at best.
516	0	a	I love this skirt. maybe i love wrap skirts in general, but many miss the mark. this one is just right. it does not have elastic waist band which always makes me look frumpy, instead it is a side zip and allows for the tummy to stay flat as well as the pleats. the embroidery is just enough and you may not be able to see the design of black on black in the fabric which makes the skirt. i usually wear a size 6 but the 8 fit just right, so you may want to size up.
517	4	a	Lovely blouse-- very well made. i had a baby last year and recently weaned so my bust line is changing-- right now somewhere between a 36d and c. the medium was a little roomy for, i could've easily sized down but i like the airy look so i think i will keep it this size. quality fabric, very comfortable yet dressy. i'd definitely recommend this blouse.
518	1	a	Great dress, received tons of compliments. downside to the dress is it stretched a bit and was feeling a bit loose by the end of the evening.
519	1	a	"I wanted to love this dress, but it has too many flaws. first, the ""waistband"" falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there. not a flattering silhouette.. second, the fabric is a sickly yellow-beige netting that looks like burlap. third, i can't imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it. on the plus side, the fabric isn't scratchy."
520	4	a	I love the style of this top, and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty, and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes, unfortunately they cut the armholes really big, so when you put your arms forward, the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway, but for $98 dollars i thin
521	0	a	Received these as a christmas gift from my daughter. just wonderful - warm and cozy and cute. size m is just a tad baggy; i'm sure i could have worn small, but no matter. i wear these often and love them! such a treat!
522	1	a	The second this dress arrived in my store i knew it was a must have. i am all things bohemian and this dress encompasses everything wonderful about a free fitting, feminine bohemian dress! first off the sleeves are not fitted. they have quite a bit of fabric to them (big armed ladies rejoice!), but have an elastic cuff so you can wear them high or low. the only fitted part to this dress is the lace panel (which still fits true to size), and the slip underneath (which appears to have a bit of str
523	1	a	I love this dress! it's so comfortable and perfect for the summer fall transition. it fits true to size and isn't to boxy or tight. i love the colors as well!
524	4	a	I absolutely love this top. i'm always either an x-small or 0/2 in mauve. i think this top runs small. i tried on an extra small and it was too tight in the chest. i'm average in bust.
525	1	a	Runs a tad big but not enough to say it runs large if that makes sense - but just beautiful!
526	1	a	"Beautiful dress. loved the navy and the low v neck in front and back. but i had to return for smaller size. i am 5'2"" 114 lbs. i ordered small and it was a little big and definitely long. i returned for an xs petite and am hoping it will fit perfectly!"
527	1	a	I wanted to love this dress! i ordered it when there was a 20 percent off special and couldn't wait to get it. the colors are as depicted and the dress fit true to size. i also liked that it wasn't too short. what i didnt like was that the dress is lined in white, which you can plainly see in the picture, but i didnt notice before ordering. i just think it would have been much prettier lined in black. im disappointed and the dress is going back.
528	4	a	The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.
529	1	a	I really wanted to love this. i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock. i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer. unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange. it cut my off in the most unflattering spot.
530	1	a	This is my new favorite dress! my only complaint is the slip is too small and the dress cannot be worn without it. i can't order a size up as the dress would then be huge. not sure what the solution is but the dress itself is stunning.
531	1	a	This dress is great! i purchased the navy colorway. it is really soft and the fabric flows nicely. i was lucky enough to snag this on sale so i couldn't beat the price. i like the buttons on the sleeves. it adds just a cute special touch. i'm 5'3 and this hits me right at the knee.
532	4	a	This tank caught my eye when it first came out couple of months ago, love the colors and the embroidery especially. the colors on top beautifu and it will complement any skin tone and the bottom is neutral so that this top will go with any bottom. this flows too goes great with skinny jeans and flats or put a strappy heels on and it's perfect for evening outings.
533	1	a	I loved the fabric and this print but it was just cut a little wrong for me. the gathering on the side made me look a bit wide. but the fabric is beautiful and everything else was nice. i did like the fact that it ties in the back so you can slim down the sillouhette (sp?) if you want to.
534	4	a	"When i first pulled this shirt from the box i thought it was a for sure winner. the beading was stunning, it was just so elegant and the details are perfection. ""till i tried it on and had some reservations. the sleeves (at the top) were very poofy and just would not lay in a flattering way unless they were rolled above my elbow to tighten them. and as a taller gal, i wish it were a tad longer (in the model shot, looks a bit short from the back view). i fear tucking it would loosen the bead work"
535	4	a	I purchased this with some hesitation, having read that some people thought it was unflattering. but i couldn't resist the sale price, and i love a low-maintenance work top and doesn't require ironing. this fits the bill perfectly. it's made of high quality fabric, there's a soft inner lining with a side zip closure, and it has a pretty narrow profile so initially i found it a little snug to wiggle into (i got a small), but once on it fit perfectly, and is so flattering i can't imagine why other
536	1	a	"Great dress for a full figure. forget about the horizontal stripes. you can wear this with great style and get away with wearing those dreaded stripes. the possibilities have been great because i wear this dress with sweater vests, athletic vests, sweaters, jackets and wool scarves. i have worn this dress with cowboy boots, dress boots and pumps and it looks great with all options. the material is thick enough that panty lines don't show. women of different ages stop me and tell me they want thi"
537	4	a	Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed), but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.
538	4	a	"My size is 4 but because they did not have it i ordered 6. a little big but i can fix it.  the price was very nice.  i thought it said gray but what i got is more brown."
539	1	a	Gorgeous laser cut top layer in a true vermillion red, oh la la! style is feminine, elegant, and appropriate for all ages.  i plan on wearing this for the upcoming holiday season as well as valentine's day 2017!  quality is top notch and fit is true to size all be it a little snug in the sleeves.  for reference i'm 34e-30-40 and the size 8 worked, i would have like to have tried the 10 but the store only had an 8.  the arms are a little snug, nothing uncomfortable, just snug. length is below kne
540	4	a	Great color fit was very true to size
541	4	a	As other reviewers have noted, the fit of this tee is very boxy.  it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans, but otherwise is unflattering.  also, the color is described as black, but mine looks like a navy blue in person.  i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult, but if able to, i would have returned it.
542	4	a	Surprisingly flattering and so very soft and comfortable. have had many compliments on this. super cute paired with skinny jeans and boots. also purchased the ausaria infinity scarf in navy which contrasts nicely with this top. and a plus--no signs of pilling yet.
543	4	a	My new favorite top to throw on
544	0	a	These shorts are divine. the fabric is sturdy and there is a weave of sparkle that i did not perceive from the picture.
545	1	a	I bought the tangerine version of this dress for my brother's summer wedding in the south, and i can't wait to wear it. cotton material has a touch almost like linen, but not rough. nice and hearty fabric. tangerine color is beautiful, more salmon than coral. wearing it with a little shoulder shrug and the laika inca shoes?the shoes aren't on the retailer site anymore, but i found them at my local store. just perfect.
546	1	a	I wanted to own this so badly! it ran really short, even with the adjustable slip and was incredibly tight in the shoulders. i could barely get the dress off!
547	4	a	"I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5"" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny."
548	2	a	"Not my typical sleepwear, but glad that i took a chance, as it is super cozy for lounging. i was worried about covering my bottom (as i purchased the matching leggings), and ordered s based on prior reviews. ended up exchanging for xs as it was too oversized. could have purchased the petite probably as xs is still a bit long (5'2""), though fits like in photos."
549	1	a	The dress is very comfortable but runs a little big. i normally wear a 4/s and the small fits but doesn't have great shape. i'll keep it and wear with flip flops casually but was hoping it could transition out too. it's just not as fitted as it would need to be
550	4	a	"I originally bought this in a petite xs. i am 5' 4"" tall on a good day. sometimes longer sweaters can overwhelm me. but the petite was almost a bit snug and short in the arms. i exchanged it for a regular xs and while i now have to cuff the sleeves, the overall look is much better. i bought the gray but really liked the blue and moss too. will be very nice for the frigid days we have in ohio. looks great with leggings tucked into boots i think. a winner!"
551	0	a	"Would recommend, but with the caveat that i had to return due to the pants being way too big all over, even the length was more than i expected from the photos online. i am 5'5"" 120lbs narrow hips, usually a 25 in pants (including other level 99 pants i own). i ordered a 25 and i could have pulled them off completely buttoned, plus they went nearly to my ankles. anyhow, the material is really nice, soft and comfy, color was good (i ordered the dark), and i could imagine they would be super cute"
552	2	a	"The design and fabric on this suit are even more gorgeous in person than on-line. i am 5'4"" and between 138/140 and ordered a medium. the thing i especially like about this suit is that it has adequate cup size and support. i am a 36c or d depending on the bra and this suit is very flattering and provides nice coverage and cup support. the straps can be shortened if you want a little more bust support. the material and design of the suit itself feel substantial and even without the straps, it do"
553	0	a	The top is huge! i wear an xs and am not the bustiest of women, but the top part of this romper felt like it belonged on a medium or large, even though the bottoms and waist fit perfectly. i was really disappointed, as i loved it in every other way.
554	4	a	I purchased this in store and the red motif is short sleeved as pictured. the pattern is fun, vibrant and great for summer months. it's a more substantial weight fabric, not sheer or clingy. the fit is tts and it is a slightly longer length which i loved.
555	1	a	Such an easy to wear and nicely cut summer dress. it does not wrinkle, has pretty colors and fits very well. i haven't washed it yet, but i like the idea that it can be machine washed. highly recommend. the fabric is good quality, a little bit thick for hot days though.
556	4	a	Love this sweater so much that i got it in both colors. got the size small, fits well and keeps me warm. the cream color is very functional. the blue color is beautiful and unique.
557	1	a	The material and color of the dress were great, but the fit was rather blah. i don't think it was right for my shape. i am disappointed though, i liked design of it.
558	5	a	This skirt is adorable. i like it because its different and i like this length. the cactus look gray in the picture, but they are green.
559	1	a	I love this dress. the pattern is super cute and looks great with a jean jacket and comfy sandals or white sneakers. tons of compliments!!
560	4	a	"This is such a lovely piece. i usually wear a medium in moth. i am 135 pounds and 5'4"". the quality is exceptional. i highly recommend this sweater coat."
561	4	a	This is probably the softest, most flattering hoodie that i have ever worn. i can dress it up or down and it has drapes really beautifully. great for spring & summer, love it as a coverall at the beach. my partner rarely compliments my clothes and actually told me how much he liked the way it looked on me. highly recommend.
562	4	a	I can understand the concerns of another reviewer about shrinkage. i have a few retailer tops made of similar fabric and they have shrunk a bit. this too fits very well, but once i wash it, it will likely get a bit smaller. i ordered a small, but plan to size up to a medium. for ref. 32ddd bust, and the small fit perfectly with a camo underneath...the shoulders seem to be cut small. so if you are busty like me, size up.
563	4	a	I could not tell from the picture but it is see through. it will be fine with a tank top i just was not expecting to need one.
564	2	a	Gorgeous lace detail on this classic swimsuit. absolutely love it! fits true to size.
565	5	a	I bought this dress for my wedding rehearsal dinner. it's beautiful. the material is thicker than i imagined, not a bad thing at all. i ironed it with lots of steam and it came out great. the tie in back is nice because it can be cinched tight or worn more loosely
566	4	a	I really like the red version of this shirt. it will add a pop of color under a blazer for work or it can be easily accessorized with a necklace, for the weekend. i am 137 lbs, a 34d chest and the small fit me perfectly.
567	1	a	Easy to wear and very cute, especially for curvy ladies. but, i think it looks best worn with a best, or a blazer on top, something to emphasize the waist a bit more.
568	1	a	Very comfortable and cute. i had fallen in love with this in the catalog and when i saw it in the store, i was disappointed. however, after trying it on, i had to have it. very flattering and comfortable.
569	4	a	I bought this top on sale - very glad i did not pay full price for it! i wash everything before i wear it. when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm - i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot, but the hole will be a little trickier, as the material is kind of filmy.
570	4	a	Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend.
571	0	a	Beautiful skirt, love the colors. so glad i bought this. runs a little big
572	1	a	Really liked this dress, but it ran too big for me.
573	4	a	"So soft, warm, and comfy! the colors are absolutely beautiful and represented accurately in the photo. i went with a small based on other reviews, and while it fits, it is slightly big. i probably could have sized down for a more tailored look but i like the extra room and think it still drapes well without looking bulky. for reference i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs (33-25-33) and mostly wear an xs/2 in tops. it does shed which is not a big deal to me but might be a deal breaker for others so i thought i woul"
574	0	a	Loved this jumper, i usually wear between a small and a medium in retailer (with jumpers it's mainly because of my hips and where the midline sits on my stomach), so thought this one would probably be a medium. but it was definitely baggy/lose. otherwise i would've totally kept it!
575	4	a	Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape, but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long, but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.
576	4	a	If i could wear this top every single day, i would. this is the white flowy top i've been dreaming of; but better! the fabric is so lightweight and breathable. i can wear this on a cool spring night with a scarf, skinny jeans & ankle boots, or on a hot summer day with shorts/skinnies and sandals. you can dress it up or down. be aware that the chest hem is at a non-traditional height; not quite above or below the breasts. however, i think it looks flattering on both small-chested and busty women.
577	4	a	"I ordered the purple and black first. loved both colors, but they ran large and after i tried on the purple i realized the metallic threads in the shoulder area were irritatingly itchy. for reference, i'm currently 165 and 5' 11"" with broader shoulders. returned the larges and just bought the medium purple on sale. waiting for its arrival to see if the threads will bother me after a bit. beautiful, saturated purple color, btw! very true to the image - not cranberry as one reviewer thought."
578	0	a	I purchased this in the gold in-store. when i got home and saw it also came in turquoise, i ordered those right away as well. the fit is amazing. the pants are very slimming without being tight. they are a comfortable and flattering pant. i really love the colors and will probably snag another pair or two when able. these are a great pant to dress up or just look snappy casual in. they are a great versatile pant. i normally wear a size 8 and weight 155. the 29 fit perfectly.
579	2	a	"Like many clothes, this looks much better on you than on the model; with a little bit of curve, it is not shapeless but very flattering. i wore it out with friends for drinks and they all exclaimed at how elegant it was. the wrist keyhole is a nice touch, and quality is very good. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs."
580	4	a	This is my favorite top! it is gorgeous, soft, & oh so comfortable. it's not too tight & works with leggings, jeans, or as an over-shirt. love it!
581	1	a	I love this dress! perfect for both work and play and can be worn in all seasons thanks to the sleeves.
582	1	a	Purchased this dress for a garden wedding and received so many compliments. the print is very lovely and the fit was true to size. i was mildly thrown off by the waffle texture of the material as it caused the dress to be a tad clingier than the picture led me to believe, but it was not a deal breaker. loved that it was lined and, though feeling substantial, was not heavy and thus comfortable in 90 degree weather. looking forward to wearing this again.
583	1	a	"I'm surprised i'm the first to review this dress! it is a must for the holidays and any special occasion! it is absolutely gorgeous! it is so feminine and seductive; it's one of those dresses that would be stunning on anyone! it is a quality dress, beautifully made, looks just like the photo. i'm 5'9"" & the hemline falls at the top of my knees. the neckline is exquisite & really ""makes"" the dress. i purchased the black version but if i was younger i'd get it in red as it would garner quite a bit"
584	1	a	Although this is a very lovely dress in the pictures, and it has a lovely quality in person, the shape and orientation of the dress is very awkward. the attached slip makes it tricky to put on, and the sizing between the top and the hips seems inconsistent (tight in the hips, large in the top). not quite for my body type - maybe better for someone with slim hips and a bigger bust.
585	4	a	"This top is exactly as described. it can be casual with jeans or dressed up for evening wear. i would have kept it but it was slightly tight across the chest. i am 5' 1 1/2"" tall, 112 lbs & purchased a petite small. my bra size is a 34a."
586	4	a	I had different expectations for this shirt in blue and when i received the item it didn't met those expectations. the material is very good quality but there is nothing extraordinary about the shirt, it is jus very plain. this item is being returned.
587	1	a	I got this in blue and i love it! it skims your curves without being clingy, and it is very comfortable. i was hesitant to buy this, but it's surprisingly flattering! it will be perfect with heels for early fall, then worn with a long sleeve shirt and boots when the temperatures dip. my only caution is that it is shorter than it appears in this photo. it falls well above my knees, and i am shorter than the model. regardless, i am thrilled with my purchase!
588	4	a	I tried this on in the store and i couldn't keep it on my body for more then 30 seconds. it's extremely itchy, which is a pity, because i do appreciate the design. :(
589	0	a	Wore this romper 1x and after washing, the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again, i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.
590	0	a	I fell in love with this romper and it was my go-to for any given day, but as soon it got wet the blue dye bled everywhere, so i had to return it.
591	4	a	Loved this blouse when i received it after ordering online! the cut and style of the blouse is so cute and looks great with jeans. it is well made but it is see-through so i had to wear something under it. otherwise, really flattering, unique design!
592	5	a	I love this top, it is a cool style mix between mensware and women's. the collar is gorgeous, making it feminine and beautiful. i normally wear a size large in retailer, i would size down. returning my large for a medium. a beautiful shirt for many occasions.
593	4	a	Loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors. love the luxurious feel of the silky, flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways. however, after washing per instructions, the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah, pilled mess that gathers at the seams (especially the bottom seam). tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing. looks like a cheap, lackluster layering top now and definitely won't last another season. so disappointed - if you ca
594	1	a	I love everything about this tunic dress. it's versatile and can be styled a few ways: loose like a shift, blouson when cinched, or eliminate the liner and wear as a layer over whatever you want. all the little details make it stand out and give it a glamorous bohemian vibe. there are tiny beads, sequins and subtle micro pleating. the fabric is airy and quite delicate (be careful.) the drawstrings at the waist are adjustable for both sides. slip is tts and the outer dress has a subtle oversize d
595	4	a	"I ordered this top from store. i'm 5'3"" and 114 lbs, i ordered size 4, fir very nice, just front is little to low for me, but i wear ten top , it will be fine. the style and material are amazing, love it!"
596	1	a	The moment i saw this, i knew i had to try it on. it's a definite power dress - made me feel like marvel's agent carter! i could take over the world in this dress. planning to wear it to work, more casually, and as my holiday party dress. it's easy to dress up or down and is incredibly comfortable.
597	4	a	This is a cute top, especially the material design. i like tops that go over my bottom and this does. if i had a problem it is with the sizing. the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get. some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size. i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big. but i still love the overall look. i am also petite which is what i ordered.
598	4	a	Ordered this top online, as i loved the colors and design, but i should have listened to the other reviewers. i ordered my usual size m, and it was just very unflattering. it was short and wide, not at all like it's pictured on the model. needless to say it was immediately shipped back.
599	4	a	So this is a great tee, problem is the white you can see through. i an not looking for a layering tee so not what i was looking for.
600	1	a	"I was in trouble when i saw this dress in the new arrivals section this month! it's one of those dresses i had to have for the holidays. i didn't want to risk it not fitting so i ordered my usual size 6 and also a size up, 8. (5'6"", 135lbs, size 6) well the 6 was entirely to tight, i couldn't even zip past my rib cage. the 8 went on, but it was very body con looking! hugged every curve! this might be the look some might be going for, but not me!! i'm so disappointed that i can't have the dress f"
601	4	a	I saw this in the store, it is definitely something i had passed over on line. it is so flattering on! i bought in ivory then immediately ordered the grey online!
602	4	a	Wore it a couple of times, it is cool and comfortable. washed it and the raw edges are starting to fray. i might get one or two more wears out of it. hand washed and hung dry.
603	0	a	I love the way these pants feel on. they are so comfortable and breezy. i love that i can feel cool in the summer without showing a lot of skin. i purchased both colors; both are very nice looking. that said, i'm not sure if i will keep them. they wrinkle something terrible. i'm pretty casual person and it even bothers me. it probably wouldn't be so bad if there weren't pleats in the front. after sitting for just a few minutes the pants look like a disaster in front. my husband said it's not ext
604	4	a	"I saw the neutral motif in the ""there's only one left"" hanger in the store and tried it on. it's very pretty, cute and sweet. i wish the bottom flares out a bit more like a baby-doll look, but that's just my preference. i tried on size 2 and it's a bit tight in the chest area (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), so i think size 4 would fit very well. despite the pretty flower design, in my personal opinion, i think the price does not justify a pretty basic tank top and fabric."
605	4	a	"This fabric of this top is gorgeous. however, i'm 5' 5"" and it hits in a really weird spot. right no the point of the hip that you don't want to accentuate. you could wear it with leggings to a casual thing, but i work in an office so its too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans. sad, i love the top 90% of it."
606	4	a	I usually wear xl in tops at retailer, but i picked this one up in a l. it's stretchy and super soft, but doesn't breathe all that well.
607	4	a	"On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...  ref: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist."
608	1	a	This is a wonderful dress. i love the fit and feel of the fabric. i have been looking for a while for a 'fall' maxi to wear with a pair of free people boots i purchased. this dress is perfect with them. the colors are fall and fresh, can i say that about fall?
609	0	a	"These are awesome! classic style and quality you'd expect from ag. the mid-rise is nice for moms like me that are not interested in low-rise jeans. tts. i'm 5'8"", 135# with a curvy bottom and wear a 29, which is my normal size in ag."
610	4	a	Love love love this mock tank!!! goes fabulous with everything! it's flows nicely the mock neck looks fantastic! you can probably go one size down.
611	4	a	Three tops for the price of one.....i fell in love with this top the moment i saw it online. i tried it on as soon as i received it with jeans and it looked just how i hoped it would. not too short, just right. then i tried it on with the buttons in front and just loved how it looked. this can be worn 3 ways......back buttoned, front buttoned and as an unbuttoned throw on over a tank and shorts. recommend this highly for just about any body type..
612	1	a	As a teacher, it's so great to be able to find dresses that are modest and beautiful, that i can wear to work, as well as on the weekends.
613	1	a	"I love this dress. the pattern/print is very different than most of the dresses i own. i'm 5'1"" 106lbs and the 0p fit perfectly. it's a delicate dress. its very fitted in the skirt portion. the top is more of a knit fabric that has some give to it."
614	1	a	"This dress is a winner, i'm baffled that there is only one review? i thought this was a dolan dress. the material is soft and substantial. the cut and style hides figure flaws without adding bulk. this versatile dress is perfect for all seasons and all social situations. i'm 5'3"" 135# 38/28/35 and purchased size m."
615	1	a	I wore this dress to dinner right after my boyfriend proposed to me! it will be perfect to wear to any bridal event like a bridal shower, rehearsal dinner or engagement party. i ordered a size 0 and 2. the mock neck is a bit snug. there wasn't any difference really between a size 0 or 2 so i kept the size 0 since it fit better in the waist. it's beautifully made and feels like it will hold up well. it's casual but still interesting. it felt just a bit above my knees. a perfect length. i paired i
616	1	a	"Love this dress! i agree with some of the other reviewers, the arm holes are a little low but not a deal breaker. i'm 5'8"" 120lbs. and ordered the xs and it fits perfect. would definitely recommend!"
617	5	a	"This dress runs tts. the fabric is a good quality, and it has pockets. i am about 5'5"", and it hit just above the knee. i really wanted to keep it, but it hit me at an odd spot and not on my waistline. this made the dress look awkwardly full and me look hippy (despite the fact that my waist is 26"" and my hips are 35"")."
618	4	a	I ordered the green version in size xl. i knew it was cropped and it fits me as shown on the models. so, i think that's true to size. the knit is very soft. but, it's the color that's amazing--such a rich bright emerald green! i love the look of it. it's awkward fitting on my pear-shape. i layer a long tank underneath with this on top. but, the hemline of the sweater cuts at an unflattering place. still, the softness and the beautiful color make it a staple in my closet. when i'm staying at home
619	4	a	I'm always an xl in retailer blouses, and to be quite honest sometimes the xl are too tight to keep. however, in this blouse the size medium fits me like a normal size xl would, meaning i had to go down 2 sizes. even at size medium the blouse is still very loose and flowy. the body is cut like a trapeze a-line, so very forgiving. the fabric has a lot of stretch to it, so the arms aren't tight. the fabric is very comfortable and the lace detail is nice. just a heads up for anyone who would c
620	0	a	If i could sew, i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however, this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well), but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of
621	4	a	"After reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman. my regular size (small) was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well. the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me. this top definitely has no problem staying ""off the shoulder"" since i have broad shoulders it doesn't completely come off me. loving the boho-chic vibe of this!"
622	4	a	I have a curvy figure, and this top is not for me. it fits loose at the top and is tight at the bottom. it is also short. i think this top works best on slender figures.
623	2	a	"Made by dawn suits are the bomb. the bottom is a tiny bit cheeky, but not thong territory- just enough side leg to be seriously sexy. the quality is fantastic, soft with nude lining. love the retro feel to the high neck top- enough support even for my 36d's. so comfy, i forgot i was wearing it at lunch. the normal triangle tops cut into my shoulders/neck, and this style does not. amazing quality and well worth the price. fyi- large top fit perfectly, but i needed a medium bottom."
624	4	a	I am going to have to disagree with the first reviewer. this is not the most beautiful top i have ever purchased from retailer, but i like it. it is a nice change from the swing silhouette that tendd to look like maternity wear on me. the key to this is to tighten the drawstring a bit. it is a working drawstring all the way around, and i find that the top is much cuter with the drawstring cinched a bit. i actually like the flowing arms, too. the fabric is lightweight - nice for the very warm midwe
625	4	a	Great light weight sweater. perfect for spring. runs true to size. definitely will buy another color.
626	3	a	This kimono is beautiful! pictures definitely do not do it justice! i love the details of the beading and sequins throughout. the only downfall is that they can snag and get fall off quite easily. delicate but still my fav kimono ever.
627	0	a	I'm 5' 120 lbs. i'm posting a photo. one lady was concerned about it being ok for the over 40 crowd. i wore it was a cami under. see pic. it is comfy. it has pockets and fits beautifully. i ordered a 6petite. it's a little long on me. buy i still like it and am enjoying wearing it.
628	5	a	Gorgeous print on light weight layers in a cut that's flattering, feminine & fun.  i sized up and ordered the the 12p to fit my large rounded rib cage & 36dds.  i agree with previous reviewers that the bodice runs small.  i will add that the neckline is tight if you have a fat neck like mine.  stats are 5'3'' 140# 36dd 8/10 on top, 6/8 on bottom.
629	1	a	Nice quality fabric and design, but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
630	4	a	Really liked the fan pattern and the cut was cute and flattering.  but the material is thin and all the edges are not finished and look frayed making the shirt look and feel cheap.  would have kept if thicker material and the edges were finished.  not worth full price
631	4	a	"I am 5'4"", 170lbs, 34dd and a medium fits beautifully in this top. the mint green is very pretty, and a nude bra under it works without showing and without it being see-thru. it is super soft and pretty, and doesn't cling. i love it!"
632	1	a	The stylist at my local retailer recommended i try this dress and it did not disappoint!  the material is fabulous and it looks exactly as pictured on the model.  it also has pockets which is a bonus to me.  i normally wear a 4 but bought a 6 in this dress - i am a 34c and i felt the 4 was a little tight across the chest - otherwise i feel the dress is pretty much true to size.
633	4	a	Like others are saying, the sleeve and bust are running small.  i found out that when i was trying the blue color one (butterfly).  however, before trying the blue one, i tried the neutral color one at my local store in the same size (s), it fit me perfectly, no issue with the sleeve and bust.  i don't understand why they're different.
634	4	a	This top also caught my eye in my local store, and being a devoted deletta lover, i had to buy. it is a straight, slim fit, so i bought a medium, instead of my usual small, to glide over my curvy lower half. it's thin, finely woven knit, with two cute little buttons at the top of the side slit; the cut and longer length in the back is very flattering. i bought the heathered black and have worn with my black pilcro leggings; it's a great top to wear over leggings or skinny jeans; no belts with th
635	1	a	The horizontal lines on the skirt and top gives the wearer and very nice dress. i am short so i got the 6 petite and it fits perfectly. the fabric is thick and stretchy.
636	4	a	I'm super into this top! i bought the evergreen color in store as it fit true to size and was very flattering. i went to buy an item that was available online only and decided to also buy this top in black. my favorite aspect about this shirt is that it can be dressed up or down. the material is slightly stretchy though it does not cling. i can wear a chunky necklace and dressy skinny pants and look ready for a nice dinner. on the other hand, this top can be thrown on with a pair of comfy jeans
637	3	a	It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however, i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however, i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.
638	4	a	"I bough a green, size s (140lbs., 34b, 5'8). the sweater is true to size: it hits at my low hip and, although it is cut generously, it is cut close to the body. the ""green"" color is very pretty and true to the monitor depiction of a bright turquoise. the material is very soft and definitely high-quality cashmere with no itch factor. however, the knit of the yarn is very chunky, which means that this is not a slimming garment. moreover, since i have long arms, the bell sleeves do not reach my wri"
639	4	a	The lace on this is gorgeous. it's feminine and elegant and fancy! definitely know if peplum style tops work for you before purchasing. if you have a large waist, it will just make you look bigger. but the top portion is nice and fitted, so i think it's very flattering. i'm 34c, 140b and got the small. fits great.
640	0	a	They were too small for me. i loved them other than that.
641	1	a	The colors and fabric on this dress are really pretty. the lace is a soft blue instead of white. i have other dresses like this from this brand and really wanted to keep it, but it runs larger than the others i have. also, it doesn't have pockets. if it fits you properly, i think you will love it!
642	1	a	When this dressed first debuted, i pretty much ignored it because i was not looking for a sleeveless maxi dress for fall. then i went on instagram and saw all the marvelous ways retailer employees were styling this. this can be worn as a long vest over jeans or a long sleeve maxi. and the rich autumn colors go well with boots and sweaters. add a wide leather belt when it's opened or closed, works great either way. when i bought my dara vegan leather moto in plum, i knew this would be an ideal pair
643	1	a	This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful, vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag.
644	4	a	"I loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my 5'8"" frame. wish it came in a tall size!"
645	1	a	"This dress is so fun and very comfy! the slip it comes with pulls the whole dress together! it has been great for warm fall days, but i can see it being warn with leggings and boots into the winter. i love the combination of blocked deep colors along side of pastels. i'm 5'5"" and the length is just right, not too short."
646	4	a	This top is amazing!! i thought it looked really cute in the photos but it's even cuter online. the material is great and you can't go wrong with the fit. i love tops that are loose and flowy, so when i'm feeling a bit bloated i can still look cute in tops. this one is definitely a must!
647	4	a	This cardigan is so much more beautiful in person. i thought it would be very lightweight, but it has a nice weight to it. this will go with absolutely everything and looks lovely on!
648	4	a	Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.
649	4	a	Colors are very vibrant! lays very nicely on the body.
650	1	a	I got this dress in the gray, size small and it fits me perfectly. it hides flaws in your figure and is nice enough that it can be worn to the office and then out later for a date or dinner. i did not try on the white/black combo because i thought the white top part might be too sheer. unlike other reviewers, i think the contrast of fabrics works. i'm not sure why there are negative reviews here, i must have the right body type for it because i love it!
651	1	a	Wanted this dress several months ago, but it was out of stock. finally was able to order and very glad i did, it is perfect! it fits exactly as i had hoped, the length is great, right above my knee and it hangs beautifully. looks great with my caramel colored boots and i received many compliments. just hoping they do some more drop waist dresses, especially for summer.
652	0	a	I love pilcro jeans and usually wear the stet fit. this is the first pair that i've owned that had so much stretch. they stretch and do lose their shape slightly, but bounce back after a wash. my main complaint may be stretch-related: after the first wear, the inner thigh area was covered in pills. granted, my inner thighs touch when i walk, but this has never happened with any other pair of pilcro that i've owned. i still have a pair of black stet that i bought 4yrs ago and they've never shown
653	1	a	I was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model. i ordered my usual size 0 but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable. i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it wasn't as form fitting as i would have liked. i ended up returning this dress.
654	3	a	"I saw a stylist wearing a similar piece from a few seasons ago and commented that i liked it on her. i was told they had a different version (a few actually) and i decided to try it on. it actually is pretty flattering, i had flared jeans on but also could see it with a dress. i left it open, as pictured, tied one button, and also played with the neck and tried a cowl... all very nice.  i debated getting my usual xs petite, but hey, they don't make it in petite, and the stylist thought the loo"
655	1	a	"So this is a gorgeous dress, but it seems to have too many elements. i wish they had left off the white lacy decoration at the neckline because it seems to make the dress more ""girly"" than ""sleek."" i am short, so perhaps the multiple design features would be better on a tall woman than on me."
656	1	a	This is a very cute dress that i did not keep. mainly because i did not like the neckline on me. if it had been different i probably would have kept it. i liked the fabric, the top is a little thin, but i did not think it was sheer. the bottom part is sheer, but there is a lining. it drapes beautifully. it is a little like a maternity dress, but not enough to dissuade me.
657	4	a	I love this designer and decided to give this one a try. i ordered size large in black. it's a nice weight knit but not too heavy. good for fall and winter. the color is an intense,  saturated black that's really sharp looking. i thought it split up both sides, however, it's only split on one side and then angles across the back to the other side, which isn't split and is shorter.  i carry weight in my midsection, and this flows a bit away from the body but not in a giant oversized way. i like t
658	0	a	The fabric is so beautiful that i am tempted to buy in a large size and have re-made. the waist is tiny. the hips are wide. when it goes to half price, i may be tempted to take it to my favorite alterations lady. the fabric is that exceptionally beautiful.
659	1	a	"I bought the burgundy color in this shirt dress. usually wear a size 4 and xs in most brands. purchased the xs in this dress. i'm 5'4, 118#, 34d. the fabric is rayon however it feels more like a light flannel or soft brushed cotton. like you've worn it forever. the length says 40"" long but i found when worn with the belt it rides up substantially. about 2-3 inches above the knee. felt like i was squirming to pull it down. i normally wouldn't be drawn to something so simple but when i walked out"
660	4	a	I love simple, comfortable tops with interesting details and one that i can easily throw on without much fuss. this top is made for people like me!!! the ribbed knit is super soft without being too thin, the lace is quite pretty without being too delicate. normally, tops like this have the lace portion sewn to the hem but this top actually has a whole layer of lace under the knit outer shell. so, it's like wearing a layer of lace and ribbed sweater on top of the lace. the good news is, the lace
661	0	a	All of my friends loved these pants- as did i! these are so gorgeous. the sequins seem well stitched. the small fit me well- hanging straight as pictured, not too snug or uncomfortable. they hit me at the ankle. there are back pockets.
662	0	a	I absolutely love ag stevie ankle jeans and own them in three different colors. i'm on the shorter side, so in terms of length i'm able to wear them as regular jeans. the fabric is comfy and stretchy and the range of colors is great for wardrobe diversity and mixing and matching! this particular style is my absolute favorite. although ag jeans are on the pricier side, after i bought my first pair i was a convert. as opposed to other brands, i find that they are a worthwhile investment. as other
663	4	a	"So, ordered online. tried this on, boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes.  back it goes. super cute but huge."
664	1	a	Great job from the fabricators in creating such a gorgeous print on light-as-air silk! i'm so happy with the dress and can stare at it for hours, that's how pretty it is. the fit is perfect on me and disguised my figure flaws since it's an a-line skirt that doesn't cling. yes, the skirt is sheer and unlined and for the price a slip should have been included. fortunately i own a silky half slip that complements nicely. i'm a top heavy 36dd, large rib cage, 140# with a square waist and no hips and
665	0	a	I love this skirt. it is stylish and very comfortable. ladies, don't be afraid of wearing a pattern on the bottom. it is flattering and slimming. i wear it with a black wrap sweater or black cotton casual jacket.
666	1	a	I ordered this in my usual size 0 and couldn't finish zipping up the top, but also couldn't fill in the boobs. i am 5'7, 116 lbs, 32a. it is very cute, but the top was pretty stiff and unless it draped on you correctly, could probably be bothersome. i was disappointed in the quality of the skirt- no lining, simple cotton/polyester. i will probably return, try the size up, but was disappointed compared to how excited i was for it. i did like that it had pockets, and would be a fun dress to wear f
667	4	a	This is a beautiful, simple, yet feminine top. a little tight in the bust on me - so i had to size up (and i am not busty). for reference, i am 117 5'3 34b. i'm probably in between a small and x-small on this - but went with the small.
668	4	a	"I love everything about this top. first, it's super flattering, especially if you have a tummy. i am small chested, and it makes me look a little chestier than i am. i tried on both the xs and s in the black (it's really a charcoal gray) but preferred the fit of the xs. note: i'm 5'8"" / 136 lbs and typically wear an xs or s in most retailer tops. the small seemed too drapey and the armholes were a tad big. my store didn't have the wine color or i would have purchased it too."
669	1	a	The fabric feels and hangs nicely. it's very versatile, you can dress up or down. i purchased the navy stripe one and wear with brown boots. thinking i might need one of the other two as well, perfect for texas winters!!
670	4	a	Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did. i wasn't crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model. i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly. crisp and clean is how i would describe it. launders well. fits great. drape is perfect. wear tucked in or out - can't go wrong.
671	4	a	I just love the print on this shirt!  it is so feminine and pretty!  the material is very soft!  i took my usual medium.  a great addition to my spring wardrobe!
672	1	a	This dress will be perfect for the mid-september wedding i'm attending. september is a transitional month fashion-wise and this knit dress will be perfect. the shimmer (which isn't apparent from the website) makes it festive enough for a wedding.
673	4	a	I loved the look of this blouse online. i really wanted a cute eyelet top for summer. the blouse looked great out of the package but the fit was not good. i am a 00p and 32 b bra size, this top was too tight across my chest but billowed out in the back. its as if the armholes were too far forward. it is fairly short but i am short waisted. i really wanted this top to work but i had to return it. if i went up one size the back of the blouse would have been ridiculously large and the top was too e
674	1	a	This dress caught my eye online and i had to have it. when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered. beautiful, vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty, swishy fabric. unfortunately the cut was really strange. after reading several reviews i went with an xs, but i'm not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having. while everything from the waist down fit perfectly, the arms were cut too tight, the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up. an
675	0	a	These jeans! i tried these on, in addition to the high rise paige denim, and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother, with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs, but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a
676	0	a	I ordered this skirt and i was so excited when i first saw it. the photo doesn't really do the colors justice. the contrast of the bright colors makes this skirt one of a kind. i returned this item however because when i tried it on, the pattern was just at the wrong place and emphasized the thighs for any of us pear-shaped ladies. the side profile of my thighs in this skirt was just horrible.
677	0	a	"I'm so bummed! i absolutely loved the pair of these i bought in the bronze color great fit, great color, so comfortable! however, i just washed them and could tell right away when i laid them flat to dry that they had lost color in areas where they had wrinkled in the wash machine. so, now they have strange lighter lines running along them. not acceptable.   i will say that the two lighter colors may not have this issue. for reference, see my stats. i bought a 26."
678	1	a	This rich color is so flattering!  i also love that it has pockets and can be worn to dressy events or can be worn in more casual settings.  the side stripes give it a young and interesting touch.  the elastic waste makes it comfortable so i know i will get lots of use out of this.  i knocked off one star because of the price.  i plan on paring this with tan sandals and a dark denim blazer to start off with.
679	1	a	"Surprisingly versatile and figure flattering without being too clingy and revealing like so many ""bandage"" dresses. the navy color softens the stripes. great piece for travel as it is light and does not wrinkle. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. with a smaller chest and curvy hips. the small fits perfectly."
680	4	a	I love this shirt. i ordered a large because i am taller, and i wanted the length to be right. while it's a little baggy, it's still very flattering and i've received lots of compliments on it. the color is exactly what is show in the image. it's a versatile shirt; depending on what you pair it with it can be appropriate for work, dinner, or a night out. i'd definitely recommend this shirt to a friend.
681	4	a	This was really billowy but not in a good way. i had to return it. looks great in the photo but not so much in person.
682	1	a	I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25% off sale. i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isn't even silk or a better material. but once i got this i was so disappointed, i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me. i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress. plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way. i don't even want t
683	2	a	I've been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for 2 weeks. it is already tearing at the seams somehow. the quality of this is very poor.
684	4	a	Saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning. i usually wear a size 8 because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a 6 in this top. it was not tight in the arms (don't have super skinny arms) and the fabric flows nicely (not too much). the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit!
685	2	a	This unit is gorgeous as a dress or as a top with a cami, skinny jeans and boots. i'm wearing it to my cousins wedding and obsessed. i bought a long delicate necklace at retailer with a gold pendant and it falls perfectly with the neckline. my only slightly negative comment is about the quality. the material is beautiful but i noticed the elastic coming through the ends of the waistband where it snaps shut. still keeping it though!
686	1	a	Fun dress to wear, i received numerous compliments on the color and design of the dress. very flowy and comfortable, love it. i wish i had bought a size smaller than i normally wea because it runs large, but an overall great dress
687	0	a	"I bought these to go with the boiled wool jacket that is also currently on sale. i have several pairs of charlie trousers, and i really like the brand. these are in a thicker ""winter fabric"" and i understand why the other reviews found them itchy. i don't find that bothersome, but the texture is a bit different. the quality is typical for charlies. the color stripe is a metallic bronze, but could look pink in the right light. the fabric is noticeably stretchy--i think without that stretch, these"
688	4	a	This shirt is very comfortable and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i bought the neutral print and everyone wants to get close to see what it is . i would buy another if it came in this type of pattern.
689	1	a	"Measurements: 30aa / 24"" waist 5'4""  i historically wear 00p in jcrew and most retailer brands. i purchased a 0p and it fit well with a little room. i really hated that the waistline is almost a drop-waist. the ivory brocade panel comes low on the navel, so it makes you look shorter than you really are.  the most impressive part of this dress is the neckline/shoulder. i have pretty narrow shoulders, so it's a quasi-boatneck and it's quite lovely."
690	4	a	This is truly unique top, the  detail around the neck is a nice change!!!
691	1	a	Beautiful! soft, flattering but not clingy~ i bought in the green which is not a typical color in the summer palate which makes it all the more appealing.
692	4	a	I'm small (4'11, 98 pounds and 34a) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me.  i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath (or i can wear the tunic by itself) and leggings plus a pair of boots.  the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting, is size down to xxs.  i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon.  the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water.  i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it (i put
693	1	a	I love this dress.i have it in black and am about to buy it in the blue..i'm usually a 4 but i bought a size 2. it is light and flattering with the gathering above the waist....does tend to crease a bit, but it's not too bad. love the way it can be dressed up or down (think boots or vans or sandles). i will dress it up to go out, but also throw it on to pick the kids up from school.
694	1	a	"I'm 5 ' 5"" and 132 lbs., 34d and the size m is perfect. i will probably wear a thin, long cami under it as it is slightly see through. it doesn't gape under the arms like some sleeveless items...it fits smoothly. as the other review mentioned, it would be a perfect swim suit cover up. but i'm going to wear it more as a casual, very versatile, perfect for a hot day summer dress!"
695	1	a	I saw a review from another petite person who said this runs small, but i'm my case it ran true to size. it's a very flattering dress and easy to wear for any occasion.
696	1	a	My only reservation is that i wish the tail wasn't so much longer than the front. i returned it reluctantly because i needed something just a little dressier for the occasion.
697	3	a	Would buy this again in a heartbeat. so comfortable and fit is great. color will look good with jeans or a dress. bought it for a cruise in the spring and it is perfect!
698	1	a	Great spring time dress that looks good with a thin top, a cardigan or by itself. the fit is a bit loose but not oversized in my usual size, so if you want a slimmer silhouette or you are not busty, i would size down. love the fabric as it has some give despite its thickness. i would have paid full price but i'm lucky to have purchased on sale.
699	4	a	"I love this tank - the colors are great and the fit is flattering. the fabric is lightweight but not cheap or so thin that you need to wear something under it. i am 5'7"" and the length was fine for me."
700	4	a	"Thank you, retailer, for creating this sweetly vintage and feminine sweatercoat. the boiled wool is lovely and the embroidery makes me lightheaded just looking at it. this is definitely a nod to retailer's past, and i love it to bits!  i usually wear a size s or xs, but bought this in the xs. the fit is flattering as can be. i was so happy to find a fitted and timeless piece in the sea of boxy and trendy sweaters. (it's true that this sweater isn't lined, but to my mind, it would be a crime"
701	4	a	Love this tee. it has a drapery cut which i love. the only thing i found was that it ran a bit smaller.
702	4	a	I loved the look and feel of this tunic. the fabric is soft. it has pockets!!! i felt like it ran a little small in the bust. i'm a 34d and rather than my usual size medium i took a large in this. i took off one star because when it was shipped to me the shoulder was coming apart. i will have a tailor fix it because i do plan to keep it.
703	4	a	"A great staple to pull out on chilly mornings. i am 5'9"" so the arm length was perfect"
704	1	a	"This dress is very cute and super comfortable. as soon as i walked into work, i received a compliment. the fabric is not heavy, but actually on the thin side. if i knew this dress was maeve, i would have sized down. i'm always a large at retailer, but with some maeve items i need a medium. for reference, i'm 5'9"", 175, l/12. i love the look of a drop-waist, but because of my big bust i usually look silly, but this works."
705	4	a	"I originally purchased this in my usual retailer size 6 (vanity size lol), and was nervous that the neck would be tight, based on the other reviews. however, once i tried it on i realized that in my usual size the body was a little too wide and didn't create any shape. i ended up exchanging for and keeping a size 4 and it fits much better in the body and i did not have a problem with any tightness in the neck in either size. for reference i'm 5'7"", 36dd 135lbs.  i would say this items runs true"
706	4	a	"I actually like this top, but i am wearing it as a cowl neck rather than off-the-shoulder. i found it at the store, so i didn't even know it was supposed to be that way. i have the ivory color, and it it does have some tan/beige specks in it, but i don't mind this at all, it adds some texture and warmth. i think it is a great neutral top for work. it has a double layer of fabric, so not sheer at all, and this keeps it smooth over my middle without a tank or cami.   i am an xs in most retailer to"
707	4	a	Love this top , although it ran very small in bust and arms , i'm normally a medium will have to return for a large!
708	2	a	These bottoms are very cute but defiantly cheeky! i would recommend sizing up if you want to have more coverage.
709	4	a	Soft! sleeve is cuffed! different. called moonscape. cool vibe. tiny threads on front of moon.
710	2	a	Great jacket for a cool morning. not too heavy and i found it to run true to size. nice little details.
711	4	a	I really love cloth & stone, and this top did not disappoint. i am usually a size small in tops but tend to be an xs in halters because the arm holes are usually big on me. i went with my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it has a nice drape to it and is super soft. i will add that when looking at the picture, i didn't notice that there is a muted pink to the plaid design. i originally thought it was just a navy blue and white plaid. however, there is a really light pink to it as well. i actually w
712	1	a	I ordered this dress before it became available in my local retailer store. i love the style of this dress but the fabric was not as expected. it is a heavy/fuzzy knit and i had envisioned something lighter and cleaner. i would love to see it in a different fabric! sadly returned it....
713	1	a	"I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0"" 105 lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress, the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people, like the model, but i would steer clear if you are a petite."
714	2	a	"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder, though. the arms themselves are really long, far past my hands, yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference, i am 5'10"", 130 pounds and ordered a small, which is what i usually need."
715	0	a	I loooove this. my favorite retailer purchase in a while and i buy frequently. ran out of s p while in my basket (there are never enough petites available) so i got the medium. it is big but with this style i can pull it off. it does run a bit large so a s would have been perfect. please make this in more colors/fabrics! i would buy them all!
716	4	a	I was hesitant to buy this top after reading previous reviews, but i love it! granted, i am two months postpartum so i am looking for tops that are airy (it's summer in socal) but cover up my tummy. the material is soft and stretchy and it does have a loose shelf bra type inset---so not a real bra but at least something there. i wore a free people bralette with it and it looked perfect! really happy with this top!
717	1	a	Ordered a size 0, my usual at retailer... very flattering, fits well
718	0	a	"There wasn't much question as to whether or not i'd love these pants, as i have several pairs of the pilcro ""hyphen"" pant; however, this one is slightly different (front pocket's and seam down front), and though they are slightly different, the fit and cut are the same. these pants are a great weight--can wear year round, really--but these will be my ""go to"" pants this fall and winter. the length is nice--can wear with shoes or rolled up with boots, too--""utility"" chinos? yes!  the fit is nicely"
719	4	a	"It's embarrassing to admit but i am buying this top for the second time because i've misplaced the first one and i fear that if i wait too long trying to recover it that it will be a sold out item and i'll never be able to have it again... hence the decision to repurchase. i just love it that much. i'm sure that now that i have the second top the first one will mysteriously show up, lol!  anyway, this top is a very flattering off the shoulder style. one of the things i really like about it is"
720	4	a	Soft, comfortable, stylish. i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed. the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne. the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time. very versatile.
721	0	a	"These cords are great--lightweight for fl winters, and the bootcut flare bottom is super cute with ballet flats or booties. i am 5'10"" and typically a size 8; the size 29 fit perfectly. they have a little stretch to them, which is great. very flattering--wish i could order in more colors!!"
722	1	a	"This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me! i am 5'4"" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space. the material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering."
723	4	a	I had high hopes for this top, as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child's top. sad to return it!
724	0	a	I agree with the other reviews - runs small. would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable. waistband doesn't stretch all the way around. bummer.
725	4	a	Love the fabric, print, and cut! it's a smidge low in the neckline, but that's probably because i'm busty. nice and breezy for our blazing hot and humid florida summers.
726	4	a	It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
727	2	a	Great cardigan that can be put over everything! cute with yoga pants, jeans, or something dressier.
728	1	a	"This dress is gorgeous, but i should warn all the tall ladies out there that it fits quite awkwardly. i'm 5'10"" and tried both the petite (thinking it would fall more like a midi), and the regular, hoping it would fit like a maxi should. both hit at a very awkward spot on my mid-shin... as much as i loved and wanted it, it looked too weird to justify buying."
729	0	a	But the back of it, by the waist, bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger, it will be too long. but i love the skirt, it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured, just below the knee in front. the waist is snug, bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier. (115 lbs, 26-27 in waist, short legs...)
730	4	a	This unique blouse is very comfortable and looks beautiful on the body. it flowy and flattering and looks great with my tan. dress up or down, it's a staple in my summer wardrobe.
731	4	a	Love it fits great very comfy goes with all
732	1	a	This dress makes me this of jackie kennedy on the beach in the summertime. i love the pattern and the pockets, oh my goodness the pockets! i saw this in the store and ordered one while i was there online because the ribbon on the zipper was frayed. well guess what we i got it in the mail at home the ribbon was also frayed. ugh. i kept it because it wasn't a huge deal breaker. the color is a little strange, not a true red more of a orangish red. i think it's super versatile and hopefully i will w
733	4	a	This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.
734	1	a	When i received this dress in the mail, i was thrilled. i loved the color and the style, although a bit too much material but comfortable. when i went to show my husband the dress, his first comment was very sexy. i can see your underwear and your skin!!! i don't understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress. when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it.
735	1	a	"This is a great dress - nice soft fabric and the red is a nice, vibrant tomato red color.  i ordered a small - i am 5'4"" and usually wear a 4 in dressed.  this dress was so huge - it might be mismarked but labeled a small.  i will have to return it - not even my seamstress can make it fit!"
736	3	a	"I was so excited to receive this jacket - have been looking for a ""leather"" jacket for a while and thought this would be the perfect one. unfortunately, i have broad shoulders and it seemed a little tight. i got my normal size s based on retailer shirts. maybe if i got the m? although, the s fit well in the waist, so... also, my small chest (32b) didn't fill out the darting in the chest area. one last wish, was that it was a little longer.  as with all hei hei, the inner lining was very cute. ove"
737	4	a	I bought the holly color which appears almost granite/slate color in natural light. overall, great transitional sweater piece for fall. i'm considering exchanging it for an xs since the s seems a bit large. comfy/cozy yet breathable.
738	1	a	"I purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it on-line and ordered it in my usual size petite 6 (i'm 5'4"" 34d-27-35) and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on. i immediately adored all the different prints on this one, the length, the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter. it's a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well. also,"
739	1	a	This is perfect! it fits tts. i am usually an 8 and this was spot on. it isn't too short either. it really is as it appears on the model. i absolutely love it and can't wait to wear it. my hubby definitely approved!
740	2	a	I wear this vest a lot for it is really cozy and goes with a lot of different types of outfits! it's is versatile and figure flattering. i only buy timeless pieces that i know won't go out of style and this vest fits the bill!
741	1	a	"I agree with a prior reviewer who stated this seems overpriced - it is. it's very lightweight and not quite the quality i would expect for the price (the washing instructions tag was sewn in all crooked - really?). i ordered the black as i was hoping to wear this to a dressy (though not formal) event but i am not sure it works on me. i think it would be a really fun summer dress option in either of the 2 colors (the blue looks really pretty online).  it is very cute but definitely runs large."
742	4	a	I love this top!!! i usually wear a medium but all that was left were larges, so i figured i'd take a chance. it is gorgeous, and not too big! the quality is fabulous, and the color is very soft and complimentary. i am so glad i ordered this. can't wait to wear it!!!
743	2	a	These sleep pants are very pretty, soft and comfortable. unfortunately, after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price. i don't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i'm not so sure. i guess if you don't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what's the point of buying them?
744	1	a	Simple, classic, figure flattering, and reasonably priced!
745	0	a	They're the same quality and fit as my hyphens from last year. easy purchase!
746	4	a	"I loved how this jacket looked online and decided to order it. however, sizing can sometimes be tricky for me so i ordered both a petite xs and petite xxs (i'm 5'1"", 113 lb, and a bra size 32 c). i tired on the xxs first and was swimming in it! so naturally i thought the xs would be even bigger; but to my surprise the xs fit way more snug! in the end, i still didn't like how loose the xs fit so i returned them both. the material is great quality and it's a cute design. i would recommend trying t"
747	4	a	I really love this shirt and bought it in several colors. i wish it came in white and in black because it's a great basic. i think it also works well for business casual attire.
748	4	a	Very feminine, fun and if you like this style i highly recommend. i am a 6/8 and both fit the same so i went with the 6- 36c bust 29 waist-short torso. fabric nice and light and i need no cami! very attractive blouse and very retailer.
749	1	a	This dress is wonderful. fits perfect. very comfortable. wonderful colors.
750	4	a	"I fell in love with this tunic on instagram, and couldn't wait to find it during the tops promotion. it was absolutely not a disappointment. as the other reviewer mentioned, the colors of the embroidery are brighter than they appear in the online images, and this actually makes the shirt more beautiful--they're rich and fallish, but not at all over the top.  i'm thrilled with the quality and overall cut of this tunic. i would agree that it might be best to run to a larger size in a range--i di"
751	0	a	"I saw these shorts while leaving the store and immediately went back to the register to add them to my wardrobe. they fit me true to other cartionnier clothing. i'm 5'7"" 126 lbs and took a size 6. there is a significant amount of stretch in them, but do not grow as the day goes on. the colors are bright and fun without looking juvenile."
752	4	a	This has such a beautiful shape, goes with so many things and has gotten a lot of compliments already. my favorite new piece.
753	1	a	Adorable dress, amazing fit!
754	1	a	I saw this dress in the store window and gave it a try. i found it to be super flattering and feminine. the bodice is form fitting and the skirt flares out to a full skirt. the colors are fun and vibrant. the neckline is a bit low for work but perfect for evening. it is true to size.
755	0	a	I love these pants, i actually bought them twice! the special dye in them did not agree with my detergent so i bought another pair on sale.....some woolite and will wash them inside out/hang to dry. will take better care of my second pair.
756	0	a	These pants are beautiful and so comfortable. the liner is a nice surprise. they can be casual or dressed up with a jacket. i'm so pleased to have gotten them on sale!
757	4	a	This white blouse is absolutely stunning in person. i wore it with a nude strapless bra. note to self: remove makeup before blouse, otherwise it's all over your blouse.
758	1	a	Ordered a few things for a last minute decision on what to wear to a wedding - i slipped this on right out of the box and decision was made! tunic style is great for all body types and hides any bulges. crochet neckline and sleeves are cute and a little sexy. dress is very comfortable and not too short. wore this with pearls and ankle-strap pumps for a dressier look. very happy with this one!
759	1	a	Beautiful dress! the pics online do not do any justice! i got compliments all day!
760	0	a	This is my first pair of mcguire jeans, and i like the fabric and fit.  thank goodness for petite sizing!  these 32p fit just right on my hips, with no gap between the waistband and my body.  fits through thigh and hips and pretty slim all the way down.  nice stretch.  of course, the proof will be after wearing a few times and washing.  i will update my review if i do not like them so much after that,
761	1	a	"I love the way this dress fits and flows! it does run big. i normally wear size 6 in retailer dresses. had to downsize to 6p. for reference, i'm 5'10"" and 34c. the pink color is 1 shade darker than shown in the pictures.there was a tear in fabric along the zipper. called for replacing the dress. the sales rep was very pleasant & agreed to send another one!"
762	1	a	This dress is really beautiful and high quality. the pattern, color, and fabric are great. the fit is flattering (i'm hourglass to pear shaped) and the size perfect for me in petite. please keep offering high quality clothes in petite sizes by higher end designers.
763	4	a	"I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9"", it is slightly cropped on her , but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4"" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans. also, it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami. too bad, its a cute design, just needs some tweaking."
764	4	a	Didn't notice the zipper in the back when i ordered this so it was a nice surprise
765	0	a	These have been a staple for me the last three years. i have owned three pairs of them in black. i haven't been able to find them in black for some time and i need these back in my life!!! please please bring them back!!
766	4	a	This top does look as pictured, the sleeves hit me the same and the size was true... i just didn't like it... it was shorter than i wanted in length and i just didn't feel like this top was worth the price so it's going back. i feel like i have had shirts with this texture and over time, they just didn't wear as well so i was afraid with 3 kids it wouldn't be a good idea. i paired it with a blazer and it looked great, but on it's on, i don't know, just not for me. for reference, i am 5'8'' 128lb
767	4	a	"I can't often turn down a white blouse, so this caught my eye online and then in person. i love the concept but found the top to be rather large despite it being an xs. i would have to size down to an xxs, which i'm not certain would be long enough on my 5'7"" frame. there was extra space in the armholes and space around the waist, even factoring in its flowy style. it's not worth it to me to order an xxs online since my store doesn't carry it."
768	1	a	As in the other review, this dress runs small. i'm usually an 8 but it was tight and short. i would love to exchange for a 10 but it's out of stock. the beading and the colors on this dress are breathtaking...i was so disappointed it didn't fit! the background is more taupe/nude than cream which i actually really like.
769	0	a	This product runs either really small or is super high waisted. either way not for me.
770	4	a	I love everything about this except the length. i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me. the quality is good, thick and substantial, color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well. just weird proportions so sadly, going back.
771	5	a	This dress is beautiful and unusual. i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i bought...the turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also can't see in the picture, but they aren't gaudy or too stevie nicks-bohemian. i didn't find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer noted...it's' my normal size, and though i'm a little chesty (32-34
772	3	a	"I have alst year's version,a dn they are essentially the smae, minus some leather parts removed... this jacket is great, the back si a little shorter, so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists (without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out). i love hte darker color, i wish it came is super dark rinse...  i usually buy petites, but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket... i am holding myself back to order this on"
773	0	a	"These pants are awesome! very light weight and will be great for spring/summer. now if only the sunshine will get here and melt away all of this snow!  i also purchased the top pictured on the model, it is super cute with this outfit and can work with so many different looks. check it out!  they run big, i would definitely consider sizing down or ordering two sizes to try on."
774	1	a	Absolutely lovely dress, in a gorgeous color, drapes well. the perfect blend of pretty and sexy. so much more beautiful in person!
775	4	a	Interesting and different cut. sleeves are very long as pictured and that goes for xs----and i have long arms---hit the end of fingertips. the orange is burnt orange and on the brighter side. didn't really work for me---didn't want to be bothered with the sleeve thang.
776	4	a	I was really hopeful that this top would work on me because it is so cute online. however, i was very disappointed when i finally received it. the sleeves look soft and snuggy in the picture but are actually a bit stiff and scratchy in person. i could almost get over the sleeves, but the white part of the shirt was horrible. i am 5'10 and a size 6. i wear a size small at retailer, and i got a small in this top. the bottom of the shirt was a tad short on me and hit just below my belt line-- which i
777	1	a	I saw this online and thought the idea was super cute, but was not sure if it would be worth the money because it looks typical. but, when i went to the store to try it on, i saw it was anything but typical. the fit is perfect and the fabric so soft. i wanted the dress in the green, but they were already sold out in my size at the store, so i had to order it online. i cannot wait until it comes in! i will wear this often during the summer.
778	4	a	The design is cute, but there is way too much fabric in the lower part of the shirt. also, the fabric for the lower part crumples easily. unless you carry around an iron, you may not want to wear it outside the house. i kept the shirt to wear around the house.
779	2	a	I sized up to an xl and although they have everything you want in a yoga/lounge pant, they just didn't thrill me enough to keep them. they're soft, warm and comfy but i didn't care for the bulk or fit of the foldover waistband. and they were too long so i returned. if you're built like the model, you'll love these.
780	1	a	Fits perfect.
781	3	a	Love this blazer! combines a chic, pulled together look with super soft, comfortable material. will be great for the office and the weekend. runs a little big?am typically a large or xl, so i ordered the xl and had to exchange for a large. might have actually been able to size down to a medium, but didn't want to deal with the back and forth again.
782	1	a	This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple, black, stylish.  unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off.  the upper arms, chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.
783	4	a	Great sweater vest. its not too thin or too thick, just right for fall or winter when its time to start layering. the material is a nice soft knit and the zipper on the back is a great addition. its easy to put on and i don't worry about the zipper snagging the material and causing any damage. i plan on pairing it with a polka dot long sleeve shirt that i have and it looks great. i am looking forward to wearing this when the weather becomes cooler. highly recommend. i am a 36b and usually wear a
784	4	a	Another beautiful mave piece!! that is too big!! waiting for the size down to come in the mail. fingers crossed this works. the large was too overwhelming on my 5'6 frame. the tank that comes with it is soft and comfy and the gold accents really make this an outstanding number!! too bad no petite is offered. i ordered the black but it was hard to choose because the white also looks amazing. i predict lots of cooing over this lovely!!
785	1	a	I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color, and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though, the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back, but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though, so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top
786	0	a	These pants pair well with anything - dress up or down, boots or sandals....but beware, they run big and rear end stretches out when sitting at work all day. if you have a booty these pants will be perfect buy one size down tho. if you have a flat rear like me, then buy two sizes down. length is good to leave uncured, just above ankle or roll up to perfect height. great color - fabric is amazing.
787	4	a	Love this top - it's flattering and perfect for a casual dinner out or running around on a saturday afternoon. super comfortable and very cute.
788	3	a	I have not owned a denim jacket of this kind in...15 years? i have a wonderful pilcro chambray jacket with a military cut from last year, but this kind of boxy, straight up denim jacket cut has not been a part of my life for a while. however, i was in a store last weekend and with the additional 25% off, i thought it might be wise to give this a try. i'm so glad i did. i've now tried it over two fairly girly dresses, with tights and booties (it's not exactly spring in boston yet), and i love it.
789	4	a	This one didn't work for me. ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein. riverdeck was cute and flattering cut. this one was boxy on me and didn't work. a bit too wide so sending back.
790	1	a	The blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure
791	2	a	"I automatically knocked off one star because every brand that offers size xs (and many also offer xxs), should also care about us size 14/16/xls as well. i ordered a size large, and of course it shows every bump and love handle in back, but i recreated a look from my local retailer's window. they showed a long unbuttoned cotton weave dress over this crochet dress. (the closest dress pictured online to what i saw is the ""mabli maxi dress"", but imagine it opened if it had buttons, and in blue.) with"
792	4	a	This sweater feels good and not itchy at all. i'm long waisted and the small hit right at my hip bone/top of my low-waisted jeans, so it's kinda on the shorter side. i liked it that way, bc it's not baggy at the bottom and is figure flattering. i tied the tie twice and thought it looked better. i have long arms and was excited the sleeves go down to the middle of my hands. it has little hole detailing down the middle, but not so much that you'd have to wear a shirt underneath.
793	4	a	"After reading the previous reviews, i ordered a size larger. i am so glad i did it! it fits perfectly! i am 5'4""/115/32dd and went with the s regular. so beautiful! i can't wait to wear it!"
794	0	a	These are great overalls - cute design but wish they came in petite! the big/straps were a little too big for me, so i had to return, but i probably could have had them tailored.
795	4	a	"I'm so glad the other reviews were so good. i couldn't agree more. this top is very well made, lined. i'm 5'5"", 32 dd and got the 6. i'll have to take up the shoulders a bit since the v falls a little low on me. what can i say, i'm modest. :) i wish they made more colors. this top is awesome."
796	3	a	This jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture, color is very close too. i normally wear a 4-6 top (sometimes s sometimes m). the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms - the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back). i love this jacket though! the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it!
797	4	a	This was a near miss for me. i love the concept of the asymmetrical shoulder cutouts and the contrast of the beadwork to the simple gray crewneck, however, with some of the beads bulging out about 1/4 inch from the shirt, i have to say it almost bordered on gawdy christmas sweater status... but still cool. i actually thought this piece felt fairly sturdy and well-made, but the thing that got me and led me to return it was that even in an xs it was indeed cut wide. if it were a little shorter it
798	4	a	"I love this top. the fabric is soft and a silky lightweight - perfect for summer. i feel it runs a size large. i'm 5'4"", 130lbs, with broad shoulders. i usually wear a medium, but a small fit perfectly."
799	4	a	I am 5'8 with curvy, muscular body and 36ddd boobs. the ruffle ends up hitting me right below my breasts and creates the look of being about 6 months pregnant. the beading is beautiful and i wish that it fit.
800	4	a	If you're looking for a sweater that's super soft and comfortable, you've found it! you could wear this almost anywhere except for a dressy occasion, but then, of course, you wouldn't wear it with a dress anyway. i wish it came in other colors because i'd buy several. it's on the thin side but not too thin. the only thing that i should mention is that it's not a black black but more of a faded or brownish black which is really obvious with black leggings or jeans.
801	1	a	Very cute and comfortable! can be wear with tights and boots or into spring with flags! very flattering fit for someone with smaller upper body them bottom half!!
802	4	a	Very warm and snuggly, gorgeous color, nice fit. i have a little trouble getting the neck to lay right, but managed so it works for work. i can't say enough how toasty it is. very good quality and styling.
803	1	a	"I fell in love with this dress as soon as i came across it online. ordered the dress in a large and it fit perfectly. i'm smaller on top and larger at the bottom (pear shaped). the dress fit well and hid all of my ""flaws"". only problem was that it wrinkled very easily and im wondering if i received a dress that was sitting around for awhile since it was covered with lint and white fuzz when i received it in the mail. other than that the design was absolutely beautiful with incredible embroidery."
804	3	a	"I've been searching for a pretty & soft faux fur coat - finally found it hanging there in retailer! there was only one - a size small. it looked gorgeous, but thought i could use it a bit roomier. i'm a size 2/4, 5'5"" & about 118 lbs. i ordered a medium but it was huge. stayed with the small and am loving wearing this in our mild northeast winter. lots of compliments. lightweight and luxe. get it."
805	5	a	You just can't go wrong with a perfect white top. i'm usually xs or s and got this top in xs & the fit is perfect. the bottom is a very subtle bubble hem that you can't really see in the picture. the top is boxy but not too overwhelming since the proportions are just right. thesis a great transitional top that will go with skinny jeans, pencil skirts or even a pair of utility pants. it can easily be dressed up or down.
806	5	a	I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today, and while the fit was great, i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather, i'm sure. i liked them, but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive, i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work, but sadly, back they go.
807	4	a	Love this sweater. i have it in both colors. it's lightweight - a nice late summer/early fall option. the sleeves are really long which i love. because it's a loose knit, it will snag somewhat easily, so be a little careful
808	0	a	This is a beautiful skirt; the colors are fresh and summery, yet subtle, and it's a nice sturdy cotton, not flimsy and cheap looking. however, i agree with the reviewer who said that this runs small. i take a 4 in most skirts, but i had to try on a 6 and still felt that it didn't fit quite right. if you're extremely thin, this might be great for you.
809	4	a	Great top!! love the fit, it pairs great with dark denim and pearls!! i ordered a 00 and am a 32c cup and 24-25 waist
810	1	a	"I'm 5'3"" 115 lbs and ordered an xs petite. i have other dresses from maeve in xs petite and xxs petite that fit really well, but this one was weirdly big at the top"
811	4	a	Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color.
812	1	a	I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly, there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.
813	4	a	I have many left of center tees, and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color), which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long, the cotton is thick, and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite 5 stars for me, though, because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me, though.
814	4	a	"I got this top in a petite xs and it fit just as expected (i'm 5'2"", 112lbs). the material wears like a tee, so it's comfortable, but the front details give it a special look. this is going to be on my go-to list all summer."
815	1	a	I'm very happy with the interesting print and unusual bib design of this comfortable dress. the bib embroidery is off in some areas. i find that the swath of beige to be too much since it almost matches my skin tone. to break it up, i took the unnecessary waist tie and used it as a bodice trim, creatively knotting, tucking and securing with mini safety pins. i purchased the m petite and though it has a zipper back, i did not have to unzip to put this on or take it off. i have a heavily padded up
816	4	a	Perfect top! the color is absolutely beautiful and the fit is better than i imagined it would be! love!!!
817	0	a	I wish these fit more like joggers, but they are slightly poofier. with the big buttons, i felt a bit too clownish. however, it's a great statement piece if you're up for it. the quality is good and the fabric has a nice texture. i think the problem was that since linen doesn't drape and scrunch like less structured fabrics, so it holds more volume instead of loose, semi-flowy menswear look. i
818	1	a	This is my second dress from this designer. it is very comfortable, stylish, and looks great with sandals/wedges. i would have given it 5 stars but the neckline was a little lower than i expected and the length was a little longer. i am still keeping it though and expect to wear it spring, summer, and fall.
819	0	a	I love these jeans. they can be dressed up or dresses down. super cute with tall boots or loafers. i wear them all the time.
820	4	a	I am two months postpartum and bought this top to have something to wear for a date night. it is so flattering and has a beautiful cut. loose but not baggy or unflattering. i bought a small but could have probably sized down... so there's a decent amount of wiggle room in the sizing. great length for jeans or leggings.
821	4	a	I liked this as soon as i saw it. the cross stitch embroidery on the front adds a lot to the usual striped top. the fir is good, not too right or lose. i took a size medium, which was good for my 5' 140 lb frame. the 100% cotton was a plus for me, also. the thing i like the post about retailer is the uniqueness of the clothing. i don't feel like i see myself all over town.
822	1	a	Love this dress. it is so comfortable. it fits great and can be dressed up or down. hides the tummy, too.
823	2	a	"I am not going to keep this dress, just because i am a little too old and need a little more structure for my figure. but it is a very cute, comfy throw-on dress. you could wear tennis, bootles, etc.  especially great for a pretty slender person,..then the loose flowy style is still attractive"
824	0	a	I really like this jumpsuit, it is long waisted on me so i hope that washing it helped. love the material and washed up nicely. should be really comfortable.
825	1	a	Love this dress. i wear a size large, but had to return and order a medium, planning to wear with boots. it's a light dress, cute for work. the only downside is that it wrinkles easily.
826	4	a	Looks and fits just like the picture. fabric is nice and soft. looking forward to wearing this tunic as soon as the weather cools just a little
827	1	a	"If you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person, i bet you aren't going to be happy with it. for a phisique that is 5' 3"" and 115lbs, this dress is not too short. however, the back key hole design is just not flattering. i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so."
828	1	a	"After reading the reviews, stating that this dress was a tent and only fit for the tall and small chested, i kind of had a battle of wills in my head over ordering it. it is very ""me,"" but me is also 5'5, curvy, and possessing a 36g bust. i had to post a review, because i received the dress today, and i actually love it. i ordered a 16 and i love the fit. i know it's flowy, but on me, it's far from tent-like. i think it's great now as a pre-fall piece with some sandals and a jean jacket, and as"
829	4	a	I purchased this sweater in grey to take on a fall european trip. it is very pretty without being overly frilly. a marled heather grey color. soft and warm without being too bulky. light enough to wear in the daytime but with enough coverage to transition into a cool evening. casual enough to wear over a tee or blouse with jeans yet sleek enough to pair with a skirt or dress. it is a roomy fit without being sloppy. i like things a bit loose and comfy - not too tight and am happy with the medium
830	0	a	These shorts are really cute and are a flattering length. grey color has a silvery look to it. keepers.
831	4	a	This tee is so soft and comfy. it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual. fits true to size, and not too loose, but not too clingy. i know i'll wear this one a lot!
832	4	a	This color is gorgeous. this could be dressed up or down. great buy!
833	0	a	The are so comfortable, flattering, and i feel i can wear them with a lot of styles: dress them up or down, it all looks good. great product! make more like this please!
834	4	a	Even though i had to return this top because it did not fit me properly, it's a very nicely made and attractive piece with a lot of versatility.
835	1	a	"This dress is very small in the bust and maxi length on short people (5'3"" 36dd). i can't wear a normal bra, i have to use adhesive pasties. the fabric is very smooth, thick and satin like, but fuzzes easily. mine came with minor thread pulls and one strap was sewn on twisted. the pattern in real life is very pink as opposed to the model sample which has more blue landscape. i'd like to hem the dress but i would sacrifice pattern. still very pretty dress. be sure to size up one or two depending"
836	4	a	Absolutely in love with this top. the embroidery and back button detail make for a unique and fun look. light and airy material will be perfect in warmer weather with a cute pair of shorts. i got a size small and it fits perfectly. measurements: 5'4, 135lbs, 32e
837	0	a	I followed the other reviewers who said these fit true to size. i have to disagree. i normally wear an 8 in shorts, which is what i ordered, and the fit is too tight in the waist and butt. i'm exchanging for 10. i really like the color and fun accents. i really hope i can get these in 10!
838	4	a	Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size. i am either a large or xl. i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size. first, the top is huge. i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely. the rest of the top was like a large tent. the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking. in fact, in the store, it was displayed with a jacket over it. online, the orange looks completely different,
839	1	a	I was so excited for this dress to come. i am 5&#39;1&quot; and 100lbs so i ordered and xs petite. it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around. maybe on someone taller this would have looked great. i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate. my dress was a much lighter blue. back to the store it goes.
840	4	a	This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really doesn't do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it's a stunner!
841	4	a	I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves, but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall, it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.
842	1	a	"I was so happy to see this dress at one of my local retailer stores since i've had this in my basket since i first saw it, i tried it on in my usual size and it runs true to size in all areas. the length is as shown int he picture, i am 5'4"" and it hit me right above the knee. i am short waisted and the dress fit perfect, sat right above my waist and then lay just as shown. not too much material to make you look fuller in the hips, and also not too young looking. i am planning to wear it to"
843	4	a	"This top is everything it promises to be. i read other reviews and purchased a small (i'm typically between an x-small/small depending on the day of the week) and was glad i did. a medium would definitely have been too big but the small fit perfectly. i have a shorter torso (5'3""/117 pounds) so i didn't experience any apprehension about my stomach showing. i paired it with a pair of skinny black ankle pants and a pair of navy and grey d'orsay heels. it worked wonderful and i can't wait to pair i"
844	4	a	Seems like all i wear all summer are solid colored tees with shorts or skirts. decided this summer i would have patterns! and color! this is a great t-shirt. nice weight. pretty pattern. i found the length on the small to fit my frame perfectly. an xs probably would be good too, but i hate having my favorite t-shirts shrink to unwearable so i always start a little bigger.
845	0	a	This skirt was very figure flattering, and the elastic waist is comfortable and does not cut into my sides! has a great look
846	4	a	"Loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on. it's a gorgeous shade of blue (denim, not navy) with some light tie-dye streaking along the top and sides which add interest. the ""bat wing"" feature is a little limiting; i won't be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me. as for the material, it's an interesting blend bc it isn't soft or rough. some may say it's itchy and some may say it's soft, to me it isn't either. it's merely smooth enough. which sounds terrible, ""it"
847	1	a	I am 5'4 and a curvy girl and find this dress to be super flattering in fit and length. i got a size 14 which is my typical size. the slip is a little tight in the bust area for me so i find it easier to put on first and then the dress over which is possible because it snaps in and out at the shoulders. it arrived super wrinkled but i found tossing it in the dryer for a few min helped - is it dry clean which is slightly high maintenance but so cute it's worth it. great dress for transitioning in
848	4	a	Comfortable with leggings or cropped skinnies. would be better as a solid as opposed to a plaid print. breathable and airy fabric.
849	4	a	Got the flower print and it is really a nice top. covers the butt!. i normally need a xl, but in this top i got a large.
850	3	a	I can't wait for the first signs of fall so i can wear this! the fabric is a nice light weight and the fit is very flattering. as another interviewer commented, it can also be worn as a dress. well worth the investment!!
851	1	a	"I popped into retailer the other day just to look around, and saw this dress - the fabric stood out first, then i saw the cut and style, and fell in love! they only had xs and s, and i'm usually a m because of my chest (34d) but it looked so voluminous, i thought i'd try it on. the s fit perfectly! the bodice fit a bit more closely, and the rest of the dress flowed beautifully beneath it. the sleeves are quite large, but it's kind of a fun look and feel. it's got a very ""peasant princess"" feel to"
852	1	a	Light and distinctive design. the fabric seems somehow synthetic and in very warm weather might become not so fresh
853	0	a	Love these charlies! the side zip is a nice change of pace and the dark grey goes with practically everything i own. fabric is a perfect weight for spring and summer too. i ordered one size up, mainly because i put on a couple pounds this past winter (like usual) and the description said slim fit. i went from a 6 to an 8 and the 8's weren't big at all, so they might run a tad on the small side. side zipper is a little harder to zip near the waistband, but i don't think that can be prevented.
854	0	a	Love these.they are a lovely gauzey cotton so they actually feel light. they do have volume however i don't believe they make you look bulkier though i suppose that depends on body type and how they are styled on top (i first wore with a form-fitting sleeveless chambray button down). that said, i sized down which meant the waistband was really too snug and so i sewed the button over to allow more room, which is why i gave them four stars. they have an elegant retro feel, versatile for spring and
855	4	a	I ordered the red in xl and the fit on me matches the photos on the model. it's true to size. the quality of the material is fantastic. the stitched upper portion is well-done. the color is much prettier in person. it's such a bright, cheerful, well-made top. i washed mine and air dried it. fits & looks great after washing. this is a bargain, especially on sale. the red combo is such a unique mix of colors. i like using blue jewelry with it. but, also mint green jewelry too.
856	4	a	This top is both cute and flattering. it is also soft and the colors are gorgeous. i highly recommend
857	1	a	This dress is nicely made , fits well and is the right length.
858	4	a	Love this sweater. comfy and trendy. can't wait to wear with my new retailer knit leggings!
859	4	a	I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!
860	4	a	This top would be great if it were longer and the neck wasn't so open. even for a boatneck, the neck was too wide. for those that don't mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay. the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me.
861	0	a	"I ordered this skirt in my usual xs. when it arrived it looked tiny. the xs was almost impossible to get on. i ended up returning the xs for a medium, which fit perfectly (and is work appropriate). my measurements are 5'6"" and 125. my recommendation would size up two sizes."
862	0	a	"These jeans were not for me. they are very straight...hence the name 'parallel'. i'm have more of a straight athletic build so for me it was too much straight and didn't flatter my shape at all.  however, very nice jean once again from pilcro."
863	2	a	I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.
864	4	a	Very cute on, fits well. versatile top, i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall.
865	4	a	Has it been 5 years already. i too bought this 5 years ago. it peels and doesn't close but the horses make up for that. very very warm.
866	4	a	Fits a bit on the bigger side, but also being the style of the top. i would order down a bit. i'm usually a 4 on top( 34c) and the xs was perfect. the wine color is classy. it's a timeless piece...
867	0	a	"These fit beautifully and are very flattering. they are true to size but may be a little long. i am 5'5"" and wear these with 2 in. heels. i have already had numerous compliments on them."
868	4	a	The top is nice, good quality, etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.
869	4	a	"The light red color is so rich! i would describe it as a burnt coral/red. i love the length - long enough to pair with leggings, but not overwhelming in my 5'3"" frame. one sleeve began to unravel the first time i wore it, but i was able to mend it easily and have had no trouble since. i think it was a flaw specific to my sweater and not s general indication if poor quality. hubby says this is his favorite sweater on me too!"
870	0	a	I love this jumpsuit! it runs a little large but still works for me. it makes it super comfy and a great piece for every day!
871	4	a	Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.
872	4	a	I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it.
873	1	a	This is my third byron lars and as usual it is absolutely gorgeous and so worth the price. it completely flatters the body and all the details add so much interest, creating a very unique dress.
874	4	a	This cozy sweater has the feel of cashmere. it fits loose and has a similar look as a wrap or poncho. looks better over sleeveless or short sleeve tops. i'm surprised it isn't one size fits all b/c it is very generous in the xs/s, which i got and i'm a 6. i can see wearing this all year long, even summer cool nights. very classic style. the picture on website looks frumpy to me, but on it is very flattering.
875	4	a	"White, lace, peplum...all my jams so this top was a no brainer order. what i didn't realize was how cozy the cotton would be. it was like just wearing a cozy tee, but looked so much better. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the small fit perfectly."
876	4	a	"I tried this on in the sotre (in balck) as i was planning on ordering the orangey one.  my usual is 0 or 2, sometimes petites. i thought the regular 0 was sjut fine and flattering. fabric is soft, adn every pattern they ahd in store was really nice (no orange-red though). was not overly snug anywhere, and i am a bit braod for my size.  i deceided not to purchase only because i have done seriosu damage in the last month *multiple purcahses) and this was one of 2 i had to pick... if it goes on sal"
877	4	a	This is a delightfully soft and fluffy sweater. i might have bought it if my store had the petite size. the white was pretty and a good weight (not too light or heavy) and comfortable. it would be fun to layer over various outfits. it did not seem to shed.
878	4	a	Very comfortable shirt.  washes up nicely with just a little ironing on the pleats.  cute detail of colored thread on buttons.  just a tad tight in the shoulders but not distracting.  no button placket chest gapping.
879	4	a	I love this cardigan! i ordered the pink and it's a really pretty color. i wish it didn't run so big but xs will be cozy all winter.
880	0	a	This is the first romper i have have purchased and is so cute! i am in between a small and a medium usually (5'7, 135 lbs and athletic). the medium fit okay, but with some extra fabric--the small fit better and was much more flattering. the romper feel well-made. can't wait to wear it!
881	0	a	I decided on these last minute for a date last night and let me say...i looked hot. :) they are super cute and flattering (im slender, but hey, im also 53) and could be dressed up or down easily. the but is because when i got home i realized that i had ruined my new gel manicure from the black die! it comes off so easily that you should be cautious of your car seats, sofa, etc. i made the mistake of not washing first, but do! hopefully thats enough to help because these are great leggings.
882	4	a	I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style, but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded, and the trim of the shirt curl over, so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.
883	0	a	Okay, so in terms of quality, i'm not sure these are really worth the price given i paid $18 for similar pants at a cheap 'teeny-bop' store, but i do love them. the legs are much wider than they look on the model but the shirring at the waist and the inverted tucks below the shirring make them hugely figure flattering. i found that they did run a little large but couldn't size down so i hope they don't stretch out. (bought xs, 5'7, 115lbs) the shirred waistband is a little loose but i like how t
884	1	a	I ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design. the blue was much more of a dark navy, not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture. the picture also shows it tying on the side. it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress. it was not at all flattering on me. one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer.
885	3	a	This cape is stunning! the perfect addition to any closet. it can be worn to a formal or out to dinner with jeans. the fur is so soft and the quality is superior. it has real fur hooks (four) to close it and the side pockets are adorable. definitely a buy and a bargain on sale!
886	4	a	I bought this blouse in both the cream and the blue. both are lovely. i would say that the size runs a bit large, i bought size 12 and the bodice hangs away from my back, arms fit well though, loose fit. hangs well. the lace is nice and stiff. the cream has some cafe au lait shading on some of the lace so it could almost look stained. i don't think that will be how it reads, though, but fair warning.
887	4	a	"One in every fifteen items of retailer clothing fits. this jacket is one. easy to grab and keep chill away. hood snuggles up as cozy collar when not worn up. model in photo must have orangutan arms, sleeves hit at wrist on this wearer with shortish arms.  boiled wool fabric is light, which is great for layering. lovely transition fall to winter transition piece. statement jacket that will live on next season and beyond.  thank you, rosie neira."
888	5	a	Medium is equivalent to eu size 40. the pants have the eu tag and i would have ordered differently if i had known this. great quality pant; just order according to your european equivalent.
889	4	a	Tried both colors....gorgeous, but kept the white as it offers more versatility in my wardrobe. happened to have an retailer cami that follows the lines of this top exactly to help conceal how transparent it is. [the black color will also need a cami -- strong sunlight or a camera flash will be revealing.] a lovely layering piece under sweaters, vests, jackets. so pleased!
890	0	a	Want to combine super comfort with super style and quality!! stop here and buy these!!!! you will not be disappointed!!!
891	0	a	"Beautiful skirt with a fun, graphic pattern and embroidered texture. i tried on my usual xs as well as a s to compare. they both fit but i decided to keep the xs since the skirt has a little bit of a stretch thanks to a hidden elastic panel in the back, plus it looks best at your natural waist. i'm 5'2"" and often need to wear petite, but this skirt is already quite short so i bought the regular size. looks great bare-legged or with tights. love the pockets too!"
892	5	a	I love this tunic! it's wool but the same kind of thin high quality wool you might find in a nicer scarf. colors are much nicer than they show up online. this is one you really need to see in person. the only drawback is that the material seems to snag easily. i returned the top at full price as it is just too much to spend for something i'll only wear a few times before no doubt ruining it. if you are not hard on your clothes like i am, this is a great find. i may repurchase it when/if it gets
893	4	a	I tried on the pink in xs in store. it was so big on me. i wanted to love it, the stylist did, but i felt meh... so did another costumer, didn&#39;t like it on me. the colors are really nice (and the blue seems really nice too), but the cut was a little wide. fabric is very soft. for reference, i am 115 lbs, 0dd, 26.5 in waist.
894	4	a	This over-sized sweater is light-weight and scratchy. i knew it would fit big, but the neck is overly bulky. the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture. fits a little larger (on me) than on the model. i'm petite so it overwhelmed me.
895	1	a	"I bought this dress in an xs, and am 5'4"", 115 lbs, and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug, but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side."
896	0	a	Noticed all the 5 star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets- so due to the past 2 years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans....i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula- thick denim, just the right amount of give and a flattering 10 inch rise. walked right in and found them- and i knew right when i touched them- they were still the thin denim that's nowhere near the quality they once were. consumers pay attention and t
897	1	a	Can easily be worn with boots or sandals - multi season dress. comfortable, flattering cut. slightly roomy, but pretty true to size.
898	3	a	"This coat is spectacular. it was love at first sight but it was only after trying it on in a store that i decided i really wanted it, even at the full price. the design is unique and gorgeous, you don't see coats like this on the street, not a cookie-cutter. it's very soft, yet warm, and has a gorgeous ochre colored lining making it very easy to put on and a standout when a bit of the lining is revealed. it seems the fit is what most reviewers complain about and i can see that. i tried size 2 ("
899	4	a	The sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy, too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body. i like the fabric (nice and thick) but it did not work for me.
900	1	a	Disappointed in the quality of the dress. love the style and especially the colors. the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made. the top bodice is more substantial. not worth the price tag of $148.00. dress does run short.
901	3	a	"This is a really beautiful kimono. soft and flattering. as well as eye catching. can be dressed up or down. absolutely recommend"
902	1	a	This dress has style and a delicate balance between design and the beauty of the material.
903	1	a	"The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.  dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to"
904	1	a	Very comfortable to wear. you can wear it any season.  it runs true to size.  nice fabric.  it&amp;#39;s a simple black dress.  love it!
905	2	a	These pants are comfortable and cozy. great for lounging around and cute enough to wear out of the house to coffee or running errands. i'll be wearing them a lot.
906	4	a	I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it, no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim
907	1	a	I loved this purchase. the dress is beautiful. it?s classy, very feminine and rich-looking. the colors and fabric are exactly as shown on a picture. it is tailored and non-stretch, so size has to be right. i am between 6 and 8 and my size m dress fits well. had to spend time shopping for a belt as the dress definitely needs one. gorgeous dress!
908	1	a	"Love the fabric that c s uses--so very soft and pliable.  fit is tts with room for draping over figure flaws and great for layering while open.  but the high-low hem is far more extreme than the new ""action shots"" show.  i'm kind of over this trend but at the same time love this shirt dress.  i'm 5'3"" 140# 36d and tried on m but will order mp online because of length."
909	4	a	At the beginning of the season i lusted over an ivory haute couture side-sliced tunic so much that i almost sprang for the $800 price tag. when i saw this at retailer, i realized it was similar, but had certain design elements that made it even more unique than the other. i just received it, and i was not disappointed! that cable neckline is beautiful, the 3/4 sleeves are perfect to show off a bracelet or two, and whether worn with skinny jeans, as shown, or wide leg trousers (as the haute
910	0	a	These are the best leggings i've ever worn. because they are structured and substantial, they are less casual than ordinary leggings. i bought them for a trip to paris, and i wore them many times. they're sleek, stylish, comfortable, and they go with everything!
911	2	a	"Bought this as ""transitional"" wear post baby #2 & i love them! will probably end up wearing them all winter long! i love that i'm 6 foot & they still are scrunchy at the bottom which i honestly wasn't expecting."
912	4	a	Oh yes. another sequin top to add to my collection. it is sparkly without being glittery- if you know what i mean. can definitely dress down as it is tee shirt- like. lots of options for this one. tts.  much better in person than the online pics.
913	1	a	The back of this dress is stunning. i am usually a petite but could get away with regular. tried on xs (115 lbs, 30dd chest) and it was good length and not too low cut. colors are really fun, the mango one has a tiny bit of sparkle in one of the lines. flory and airy.
914	1	a	This dress is great for hiding any insecurities. it's also very comfy.
915	4	a	This is that one special, whimsical beauty that you hope to open on christmas morning. super comfy, not at all itchy and the pattern and colors are super stunning. even more vivid in person. i've never seen anything quite like it! very eye catching and oozing for compliments. can be dressed up or down, quite easily. very warm, and surprisingly true to size, even with the m/l combo. i'd say definitely worth the price..it is expensive, but this heirloom worthy piece is worth the splurge.
916	1	a	Super cute dress for fall. detail is much more intricate than what you are able to see online. not too long and will look perfect with tights and boots.
917	0	a	I can't say enough about this pant! the fit is perfect, enough shape to hold you in but not so tight you think you're wearing leggings. this is my go to business casual. can't wait to get another color, my store had this in black
918	2	a	So nice. lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs. will look stylish on all heights. very impressed with the styling and construction. fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage.
919	4	a	This sweater is so much cuter in person than as pictured. i bought the lovely red one today. i got my usual size, xs. i plan to wear it more fitted as a top rather than as a jacket, although i can still layer it if i want. the color is divine. the weight is just right, not too heavy but not too light. sometimes peplums overwhelm me, but this one did not. it hits at just the right spots and is flattering all over, particularly making my waist look small.
920	0	a	This is my 4th pair of these printed cords and they are beautiful- the color says navy but these are definitely black with a grayish print. very stretchy all over except for the waist band which is a little uncomfortable but it might loosen up some. i wish the rise on these was a little higher. also worth noting is that the design on larger sizes won't look exactly like the picture- my size 33's have the floral scroll print up the front and the back, but also the cut has the scroll print running
921	1	a	Like some other reviewers, i, too, have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself, i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust, and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps, i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool, and i was rea
922	1	a	"I just got this tunic last night and was excited to try it on. i could barely get it over my shoulders and once i did, it was immediately apparent that it was very tight under the arms and in the shoulders. i usually wear a 12 but listened to all the other reviewers and sized down to a 10. the 10 shoulder seams were significantly narrower than i would have expected. i don't think even a 12 would have been large enough in the shoulders.  very bummed, but yet i wasn't drawn to the colors in pers"
923	1	a	I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8, went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type, but compared to the model, this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.
924	0	a	I cannot say enough about these chinos. i hope retailer will keep them around for a long time despite the news that says retailer is going the way of jcrew. these pants are more stylish and comfortable than any other chinos i have owned. i am a teacher and being comfortable and stylish at the same time is important. i am a 10 to 12 and a 30 fits me fine. please please retailer keep making these every season in fun colors!!!
925	0	a	Bummer, i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can't bare to wear them anymore.
926	1	a	"The online pictures do not do this dress justice. the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft, sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel. the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures. this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think ""oh my gosh, that's the one!"" but if you try it on, you will have this moment. it is comfortable, flattering, and slimming-a prefect everyday dress."
927	1	a	I ordered this online, and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head, therefore i couldn't even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress.
928	0	a	I got size 26 and they don't fit me as ankle, they fit me as long skinnies, but the quality is so good. they're smooth and stretchy, but they feel thick enough that when you pull them on you can tell it's quality denim. a great pant buy if you're looking for soft as butter grey jeans.
929	4	a	I've been waiting for this to go on sale, and just picked one up in store. the details and style of this blouse do not disappoint! since it's billowy in nature, a size smaller fits me perfectly.
930	4	a	"The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise, the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area. the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials."
931	1	a	"This dress is fantastic! it's super flattering and very versatile. for reference, i am 5'4"" and 155 lbs, and usually a size 8 - 10 in retailer dresses. the size medium fit perfectly. highly recommend this item!"
932	0	a	Love this color! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on! so pretty! if you love pilcro chinos--you will be happy with these! same great fit and an awesome color!
933	4	a	Lovely embroidery with a classic look, great addition to your wardrobe.
934	0	a	"I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however, after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6"", size 4, hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure."
935	1	a	"I think this is a really flattering dress. i like the length of the sleeves (they're not long like in retailer's very first navy photo but all the other pics are accurate in my opinion.) in my photo, i'm wearing an xs regular so i'd say it's shorter than 35"" because i'm only 5'3"" and it's above my knee. it may run slightly small because i'm a 34aa, with a 26"" waist, 34"" hips and usually wear xspetite in retailer but this xs fits me fine (although to get it to be fitted at the waist, xxs might be bet"
936	4	a	Love the top! it fits perfectly. i was a bit worried it would look like a pregnancy top on me as i'm a 34dd, but it doesn't. i've received many compliments on the top, its incredibly well made and has beautiful detailing. it is sheer so you'll need something under. the material is quite light as well which is nice.
937	4	a	Super cute but the fabric was so thin & flimsy i was afraid it would fall apart once it was washed so returned it.
938	2	a	These tights are comfortable and the material is great. i bought the gray and holly color and the colors are as shown online. similar to most nylon tights they snag easily. definitely not a legging and similar to other reviewers these won't keep you warm in the winter.
939	0	a	This is a gem. stretchy, graphic, easy to wear, lightweight and so fun! the best thing about this is it can be worn as a jumpsuit or as a higher waisted pant! i've seen it paired with a pilcro denim jacket and cute sandals, and then worn as pants with a black tank, jacket and silver belt. i love that this can be dressed up or down...you could even throw it on over your bathing suit as a coverup. i would go true to size on this one since there is some room and the top has great stretch.
940	4	a	I finally tried this on now that it went on sale, and it was surprisingly flattereing. love the blue color, and i assume the purple was equally nice. fit is true to size as in i tried on the regular xs and it was great, long but ok for me,
941	4	a	I am very into the lace tops! purchased this but it's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5'3, it feels almost like a tunic. lots of extra material in the back. love the look and if you're tall enough, it should work for you!
942	1	a	The cream color in this dress is divine. such a stunning dress that can be worn with a vest, jacket or alone. it looks very luxe and expensive in the cream color. because it's a knit, can go smaller in size. i tried on both the x-small and small. opted to go with the x-small. found it fit better.
943	4	a	I bought both colors thinking i might like one since i wasn't totally sold on colors looking online. well the cut is sooo flattering that i was sold and had to keep both. this shirts are great.
944	4	a	"I thought this was adorable on the model, but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan, but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs."
945	4	a	I had been looking for a new plaid shirt for fall. this one is perfect! the yellow is muted, but i really like it that way. other reviewers have commented on poor quality, but it doesn't seem that bad to me. definitely recommend!
946	5	a	"This is a unique blouse and well worth a try. it is pure wool, so dry clean only. though it is wool, it is actually very thin and lightweight. i didn't find it to be scratchy. . i am a size xl, but in this blouse the large fit fine. the narrowest part of this blouse is the width of the shoulders, everything else is very voluminous. for this reason, it doesn't flatter my full figure; it makes me look much heavier than i am. my only options are to return it, or bring it to a local seamstress who"
947	4	a	"Although this isn't a soft top, i didn't find it that scratchy or bothersome at all. it's 55% linen! and, for linen it's soft. it's also got tons of stretch which makes it very comfortable as far as movement.   i bought the black, and i do not find this sheer or see-thru. it's a light thickness which makes it perfect for layering under a jacket or sweater for a cool spring or warm fall day. i found it running tts, with the sleeves and length a little long (i'm petite) making perfect for the av"
948	0	a	"Lovely pants, incredibly comfy fabric, but too short for 5'11'' people. stated inseam of 31.5 is a bit understated, but it is clearly not 34"" that i need. had to take it back to the store."
949	0	a	Great pants! great fall colors. great for day or night. super fun and funky. love them!
950	1	a	"Great dress! wish it came it more colors, would like to buy another one. i am 5'5"",125, size small is perfect. unlike one of the previous reviewers, i do not think it is too clingy. maybe she needed to size up.very versital, cute with a jean jacket, or long lightweight scarf, booties, or sandals! ."
951	2	a	So cute, warm and fashionable. i ordered a size down and it fit like i was in a sausage casing. gave that size to my daughter and i will order my usual size. the arms are small and the rest is true to size. love the quality softness and style of this. with a hood, for the win!
952	2	a	"This is a beautiful swim suit! the overall look is lovely; the ruffle is sweet and the low-cut front keeps it just the right amount of sexy for a one piece. i didn't keep it only because i would have preferred the leg opening to be cut a little higher. otherwise, it fit very well. i'm 5'10"" and 150, with broad shoulders and a substantial rack (nursing a baby right now) and i didn't have any problems with support. great buy!"
953	4	a	Love the look. love the fit for both professional and casual looks!!
954	4	a	When i saw this top.... i had to have it.....runs very small... would size up especially if curvy on top.......sheer but not too sheer...... feels and looks delicate...... no problems so far
955	2	a	This is an exceptionally soft and high quality coverup. i always look for a coverup that could double as a dress so that i can walk into a restaurant without feeling underdressed. i bought the white -- i always buy white it seems, but loved it so much, i came back for the blue. get this and live effortlessly this summer.
956	4	a	This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit
957	1	a	If you're on the fence about this dress - go for it! i am a huge retailer shopper but haven't ever been compelled to write a review until now.  this dress fits beautifully.  the materials is so soft and comfortable and the design of the dress is very flattering, with or without a belt.  i am 5'2, 118 pounds and i purchased the pxs. it's perfect!  i wore this with booties and received a ton of compliments. the fringe and hemline make this dress really stand out.
958	4	a	Maternity like, and although the back is really cool, there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwear/pajama. returned.
959	4	a	I was looking for long vest to go with skinny jeans. this is exactly what i was looking for. the color is better than the pic to me. the style is flattering.. the size is just right. can't wait to wear it. i strongly recommend it.
960	4	a	I like this sweater but i'm not in love. the rib knit on the sleeves are too form fitting (not restrictive) on my chubby arms so it doesn't look flattering when i wear long sleeves. i do appreciate the mixed patterns and the soft moss colorway, it's very pretty together. i purchased the medium petite and the length looks good. maybe i need the large because of my body type. i'll give it another chance when my paquerette gets here
961	4	a	"The craftmanship & material (not itchy at all to me) are exquisite for this unique sweater/coat, but the shape is not for me. i have a slender build, 5'8"" 130 lbs, 34 b chest (i oredered my usual sm, which fit), and the silouette of this piece looked ridiculous on me. when buttoned, the top half was nicely fitted-- not snug; however, the lower half ballooned out to overemphasize the hips due to the pleating in back. the thing is, i have no hips, and having hips is a very good thing, though not i"
962	1	a	This dress is chick but funky! the material is knit but not the usual itchy knit. it's comfortable and cool. the colors of the stripes are cool - they're earthy and go well with black, brown, blue and gray. this is going to be a favorite for years.
963	2	a	"Just got these mara hoffman classic bikini bottoms in flight azure print.today and love them: high quality, fully lined and reversible. the pattern placement is perfectly symmetrical and the colors are just like the online photos. . i think the size chart on the mara hoffman site is correct for where the bottoms sit on my body, above the widest part. i have a a-shape with smaller waist and hips, full behind and thighs (currently 33-25-37ish, 38"" at the widest which is at my thighs). in these t"
964	1	a	Size up!!! this dress is great quality and so flattering but tight in the arms and chest. ordered in my usual xs and will regretfully need to return it.
965	1	a	"This is a beautiful dress (and my husband agrees). i'm 5'5"", 114lb and the xs was long on me and a bit baggy on top. i looked in to having it taken up, but i think that will be hard to do without damaging much of what's elegant about the dress. i hope that someone with more curves and a bit more height is able to enjoy this one."
966	4	a	"Cute top! the bright red crochet shoulders and back add the perfect pop of color to the light blue pinstriped front. it's a little loose and boxy around the bust area but overall i think it's a flattering shape. i got the regular s and don't find it too short. for reference i'm 5'2"", 134 lb, 34b. i often wear petite sizes but due to other reviews mentioning that the top is short i ordered the regular size and am happy with the length and fit."
967	4	a	This is a cute stylish sweater different from the typical. it doesn't itch which is key at least for me. i ordered an extra small but i am normally a small since it seems to run long. i think the neckline is unique :)
968	0	a	The colors and design of this skirt are beautiful. the fabric hangs nicely. the color i more burnt orange than red. i ordered my usual size (6), but it is too small.
969	5	a	So sad that this cardigan did not fit me. i listened to the review i read and tried a small, didn't come close to fitting. i tried a medium and it also did not fit. i think this item is designed for someone who has a small frame. i seem to be too tall for the item and too big in the chest. i usually always fit into a size medium.that being said the cardigan is very pretty and feminine, has an interesting design and is well made. so sad this item didn't work for me :-(
970	0	a	I was lucky enough to get these on sale with an additional 40% off, making them a fabulous deal. they are nicely made, and the shade of blue is very pretty. my only complaint, and the reason i'm on the fence is that they are so big. i usually buy a 31 in the ag stevie jeans, occasionally a 32, so i figured i'd be safe sizing down to a 30. wrong. i could have gone to a 29, and possibly even a 28....they're that big! i do like them though, and may just try shrinking them in the dryer.
971	1	a	I loved this dress before putting it on, but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type. it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for. sadly this will be going back. i loved the print and the feel of the material. just not a flattering cut for me.
972	1	a	"This sweater is gorgeous...it is of great quality and very warm. i was very excited and wanted it to look great. however....i have a large bust and am full figured...so it was not appealing and just kind of ""hung there"". i feel that it would look great on thinner women...and it is a gorgeous sweater...just not for me!"
973	4	a	"Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo). sadly, it's going back."
974	4	a	This is the softest shirt, super comfy, very baggy but i'd say true to size for the style. it is a bit thin and i'm worried how it will hold up, or would have given the full 5 stars. i'm not a usual fan of the turtle neck but this is so soft, i love it!
975	4	a	The tunic shown here (black and white) is the style i purchased, but not the color scheme. the one i got has a navy background with colorful large dots. the top is very cute, but has one drawback. it has covered buttons all the way down...and the top area gaps a bit so you can see your bra. i remedied the situation by sewing down the area on the placket around the top two buttons. worked like a charm! my new favorite top.
976	1	a	I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue, but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide, shapeless, and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite, i'm not sure it's worth the price, because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.
977	4	a	I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso, this would work great. if not, unfortunately, its not great - tear
978	4	a	"Looks nice and i did like the button detail on the collar. colors are nove and the feel is soft. i would probably have to get a petite smaller size."
979	4	a	I ordered the navy/gray version in size xl. it fits me true to size, matching the online photos. the colors matched too. the fabric is so soft. it's warm while being lighter in weight. very comfortable. the collar wasn't bulky either. it's made to last. one of my retailer favorites.
980	1	a	I don't have anything like it in my closet, really excited to wear it
981	0	a	I loved almost everything about this skirt. thick and lined and love the buttons. comfortable. the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom, presumably from the buttons. i was torn, but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back.
982	4	a	I bought this sweater to freshen up my fall wardrobe and just love it! adds texture and warmth to every outfit.
983	1	a	I love this dress! it is so comfortable. the material feels nice and the print is beautiful. the only reason i didn't give this a 5 overall rating is because this fits a little big. i bought a petite medium and the elastic around the top is not as tight as i'd like. it still fits and stays on but it would feel a little better if it was a little more snug at the top. i love this dress because it is casual enough to walk around in but still feels somewhat dressy. i will probably take this dress wi
984	4	a	What a cute swing sweater and so easy to layer. this jacket looks great snapped or left open and the collar and hood leave such a soft look around your neck. this has such great elements of cozy and warmth just in time for cool weather!
985	4	a	I absolutely love this blouse...i ordered it in peach..then waited for the raspberry to come back in my size...now i have 2 colors...it runs really large....but putting a tank or cami underneath is fun :-)
986	1	a	"Great dress in terms of material, quality, print...something about the weight with the lining made it not work for me. i ordered one size down as recommended by other reviewers, but that didn't work; there was too much fabric for the length and the lining made it look heavier. i ordered a medium and i""m 5'5"" on the curvy side. oh well. i've had so much luck with other retailer orders so i'm not too disappointed."
987	1	a	This dress is a new favorite! the cut is great for most figures and the fabric has a nice drape around the curves of the body so it sort of has a slimming effect - which i love! i'm petite and curvy and so the hem lands closer to top of my knees than it does on the model in the image. the color in person is slightly more purple and less brown/maroon, but it still works for a fall/winter wardrobe. if you are uneasy about the colors, i recommend looking at it in store before purchasing. i love thi
988	4	a	Just tried this on in store. the color in the photo is wayyyyy off. it's a hunter green and dark navy zigzag. for maeve it runs large. i am usually a medium or a 10 and a s worked best. i'm a 36d and there was no pull at the bust. will pick up when on sale (bc a hundo for rayon is laughable).
989	1	a	I didn't really pay this dress much attention online or even in store. an associate suggested i try it on. it's so much cuter on than it appears online. the button detail is great and i love the pockets. it does bunch up a little but not too bad. i tried on my normal size 2 or 4 and the 4 fit me perfectly. it was a tad long and maybe the petite will be better. i have fairly sensitive skin and the wool pieces were a bit itchy so i had to take it back. but if you aren't sensitive then this is for
990	2	a	Beautiful fabric, great quality, fits true to size. love them!
991	1	a	"I wasn't going to even try to see it this dress would fit.  it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model.  i'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it!  my outfit is a floppy straw hat, skinny leather belt and flat sandals.  there's a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out.  i ordered the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#."
992	0	a	I love how these jeans look on. tts, adorable. i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket. pair #2 -the stitching came out in the exact same place. this seems to be a problem with the quality/sewing. the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined. 2nd pair has to go back. too bad.
993	1	a	"Too thin at bottom where lace is.  couldn't sit in the dress without worrying i was ""hanging out"""
994	4	a	I have nothing but positive comments to say about this sweater. i'm 5'6, 130 pounds and i got a medium because my shoulders are a bit wide and my sweater fits me just as it does the model. it's not bulky but it is very warm, and the colors are out of this world! a very high quality and unusual piece that will be in my wardrobe for many years.
995	4	a	I really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy. i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same, boxy but shorter so i decided to pass.
996	1	a	Love this dress - haven't worn it yet but wow the design / artwork of the fabric is beautiful !! waiting for weather to cool off a bit so can wear with my off white suede gogo boots ....
997	4	a	The pattern and color of this top are beautiful. when i saw the pattern, i knew i had to have it. the fit is a bit strange, short (which is fine for me as i am petite) and boxy. i bought it on sale and think its good value for the price. its a good late summer/early fall piece.
998	0	a	"I finally broke down and went on a christmas shopping spree at retailer for myself with hubby in tow as they are gifts from him. the skirt is a beautiful dark navy, super soft knit. very long with a texture pattern. i am 5'9"" and have put on a few pounds lately but typical wear and 8/10 and bought the large because i didn't want to try it on. it works for me because i don't like skirts to cling to much. even my pencil skirts i like a more loose fit. normally id say a medium would probably f"
999	0	a	"I like the jeans a lot. they're definitely skinny fit and more like leggings -- very stretchy. i feel like they would fit all shapes and sizes because of that ""give,"" so the claim that they're flattering on everyone is probably valid. i also appreciate that there is no stonewashing, as grey jeans often seem to have -- they are all one hue from top to bottom, with a little bit of linear line texture to the fabric. the only flaw (at least i don't think it's intentional) is that the front pockets l"
1000	1	a	Overall, it's a beautiful dress, and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you'd expect for the price), and as other reviewers have mentioned, it's just a tad too short. for reference, i'm 5'5, 125 lbs and the 2 fit well, but hung well above my knees. there's no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned.
1001	1	a	Loving the ombrã© color combination, the smooth lining, the fuzzy felty warmth and the slimming effect when viewed from the front. if you are busty or hourglass, stay tts or size up. if you are straight and/or small busted, size down. if you have a round bottom but slender on top, i'm not sure this dress will fit the way you want, do try it on in person.
1002	0	a	Love these shorts! fit true to size and the material is so amazing.
1003	4	a	I actually found this blouse to be quite nice. i'm not sure that i'd wear it as a tunic, though. it looks great tucked in and the print is fun but nothing exhilarating. for the price, i expected more.
1004	0	a	"My first review and first full price designer denim purchase....  i recently lost weight and in need to replace all my pants and in search of a dark wash high rise jeans (preferably in black), finally decided to buy this at full price online coz of all the fab reviews. i decided to purchase the 25p, thinking that i may return after receiving it in the mail since i wasn't able to try at the store and not sure if i got the right size, also it's not the high rise denim that i was looking for. but t"

1007	4	a	"This is one of those ""very retailer"" tops that you can't find anywhere else. the feel is ""folkloric"", but the country is not specific. although listed as a ""tee"", the material is a knit with heft and is lined (from the bust seam down). the embroidery is combined with cut-work to give it a high-end finish (and justify the price). this is a dress-up tee for sure. i will most likely treat it as a blouse and wear it with cropped black culottes or a slim midi skirt. i wear either a 0 or 2 in mos"
1008	4	a	I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side, so the garment flows nicely, it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial, heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey, not whi

1010	1	a	I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper, looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit, lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a

1013	1	a	"I purchased a small in this dress. 5'6"" 34d. i could have gone with a medium if i wanted to wear a bra. this dress is not meant to be worn with one. it fit much better without. i liked the regular length as the dress is supposed to be a midi. this dress screams ""summer"" to me."
1014	4	a	I thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe, and while the color didn't disappoint, everything else did. it's a very loose slub so it's very see through and thin, i'd have to wear a cami under it. also the tie front has a very high slit! like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt. i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga/ gym wear, but definitely not at this price. pass for me sadly...
1015	1	a	I got size 2p. it comes down a little over my knee cap and i wish it was rather a little above it. i have a small chest about 32b and with a padded push up bra it was still bit loose on the top. i do have a shorter torso. i feel like i could've gone with the 0 petite. i'm a pear shape and more like a size 4 on the bottom and i weigh about 115lbs- there is tons of room to go smaller - it is not form fitting on the bottom at all. has that slight polyester feel but the fabric is beautiful and thick
1016	2	a	This top is cute, my kind of style, but it is really sheer. i would need to wear a white tank top underneath.
1017	3	a	Just purchased this on sale. will be perfect for summer on those days you wear dresses and don't want your skin to touch the subway bench! love it!
1018	4	a	Just picked this up at my retailer and i just love it. its totally different than your typical tee. the bottom is more of a blousy silk material and the top is a super soft knit. it lays really well and is long enough to wear with leggings! my favorite part is the t strap in the back. such a beautiful detail and so much fun. my only criticism with this top is where it hits on the bust. im a little more full figured, so the top looks better on me when the silk part isn't under my boobs. kinda have
1019	1	a	Ok, the material is great, light & airy. the thing they don't show you is the waist line is tucked in the photo, that's why you cant see the bi level hem line. the hem line is fantastic. the waist is the problem, the whole dress just hangs huge from bust down. the material is so light i would caution against darting the dress. i created a button loop cinch under the outside corer of the pockets, on the seem of the waist. this worked for me.
1020	4	a	I purchased the gray motif with the bright flower design. i have owned many blouses in my lifetime, but i must say this is one of the best fitting and most attractive of most any i have ever owned. it falls just right on my body and is smooth and luxurious with a silky feel. the cuffs fall on my wrists just perfectly. the color is just right for my fair skin and light hair. this was my first order from you and if this is any indication of the quality and fit i will receive i'll do a lot more ord
1021	1	a	"The cotton, the print, and the online presentation of this dress are beautiful, i ordered right away! but there are some discrepancies. the shoulders have a ""puff"" to them that i don't notice on the model, and that doesn't flatter athletic shoulders. the buttons are (cheap) difficult to button. the waist sits much lower on the model than it must on anyone else, it's nearly empire on me. and, there is a lot more volume in the skirt of the dress than is shown in any photo. because the dress is tig"
1022	4	a	I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. the shirt in our store was featured in all colors.  i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft!  i felt like i was wearing a t-shirt with an easy on and easy off feel. the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in.  i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit. love!!!
1023	1	a	"When i saw this online, i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw, the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it: ___________ pros: - the colors you see online are exactly the same in person. - the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh"
1024	4	a	This was my favorite piece in my order. it fit so well that i immediately went online to see if they had other colors. they don't. i voice the other reviewers opinion: get more colors in of this style. i would order in a heartbeat. i plan on wearing this to work (it's freezing in my office) but it is versatile enough to pair with jeans for a casual look. the material was soft, woven tightly (a good thing) and well made. good one retailer! definitely a keeper.
1025	1	a	This is a gorgeous dress. the print is beautiful and unique, however because it is baggy the dress does run big on smaller frames. i would definitely recommend sizing down.
1026	1	a	This dress is simply gorgeous. the slit is just right, the colors are great, and most of all the fabric is very comfy! i highly recommend!
1027	4	a	This sweater came in just as expected . . . adorable. as others have said, it is soft and comfy. i will wear it everywhere (including work). i love it! :)
1028	1	a	"Bought this dress for my daughter to wear to a rehearsal dinner and i couldn't believe how beautifully it fit. fitted through the top, falling to a gorgeous flare. hit her at knee (she's 5""6'). classic, elegant, femme fatale look that will work for a range of occasions."
1029	4	a	"I expected to love this, since i usually look good in this style of jacket. it's definitely comfortable and the fit was fine, but i really don't care for the wooden buttons and the overall look was just ""meh."" it's going back, unfortunately."
1030	4	a	I got the dark purple color of this top and it is perfect! i wear it all the time. it's comfortable and it's cute! plus if it gets cold i can throw a warm sweater on top of it.
1031	4	a	Just received this in the mail, and i love it! the fit is wide and flowy, but i wouldn't say it runs large... i don't think i could have sized down in the shoulders. perfect easy, breezy fall top. cannot wait to wear it!
1032	1	a	Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.
1033	4	a	I wish i could buy this is more colors! so easy to dress up or dress down
1034	1	a	When this piece arrived, i was surprised at how weightless it was. there are 2 layers to it, an underlayer and then a very fine silk toplayer together, the ensemble is incredibly light and it is almost as though i feel like i am not wearing anything at all. to take it home, i did have to kind of stuff it in my bag, and this caused some considerable wrinkles which are very difficult to get out (super stubborn( but i am pleased with the look of the garment. usually, i like the look of a dress that
1035	4	a	I bought this top in white. i wore it with black skinny crop jeans. it is very cute and flattering. the length is just so that it makes the swing top flattering without is bring too overwhelming. i received lots of compliments. the quality is great and the top washed up well too. love it. for reference. i'm 5'5' 125 lbs and bought the top in small.
1036	4	a	I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it'd work out based on all of the good reviews. when i got it, i was happy with the fit and fabric, but i was stumped as to what i'd wear it with. it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just didn't know if i could pull off the length. i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath. it's so stretchy, warm, and cozy! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k
1037	4	a	"The photos don't look it, but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3"" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall.   disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!"
1038	5	a	This gorgeous &amp;amp;amp; beautiful dress is hampered by a see-through unlined bodice and all viscose/polyester fabrication.  by the way, did you see the price tag?  at least the skirt is lined.  if you have deep pockets and don't mind the slightly rough fabric, go for it.  and wear a nice bra.  size up if you're busty.
1039	4	a	I bought this in both the navy (a more saturated blue in person - gorgeous!) and green, but both are going back. it fit everywhere but in the upper arms, even across my chest, and i usually encounter the opposite. i think it might just be the way it's cut across the shoulders that don't allow for much movement. so, while beautiful and so incredibly soft, it has to go back. (if you have slender arms, i think it would be a great fit.)
1040	0	a	"This skirt is wonderful! the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal, but the quality is impeccable. i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt. it can be dressed up, dressed down, worn during all seasons. the design/pattern is artsy and whimsical without being too ""out-there"" (unless you want it to be, of course!). the fit is true to size, and the delicate details are just lovely."
1041	2	a	"These are my favorite tights. i love how they are opaque. i love that they are thick but not so thick as to be only appropriate for winter. they are slimming without feeling too tight.  why don""t you sell these any more??? please bring them back!"
1042	4	a	This is a lightweight sweater...good for the office and summer evenings.  here in so. cal it's a good weight sweater year round.  love the lace trim.  runs a bit large but not too bad.  color is a light cornflower blue, not lavender.  this works for me but if you're looking for a lavender sweater, you might want to think twice.
1043	1	a	"It is a pretty dress but not what i had hoped for (i ordered it online.) i like slits on sleeves but the dress doesn't fit me well, so i plan to return it. p.s. it has pockets! :-)"
1044	4	a	"Button down shirts usually aren't my thing, but the soft fabric of this top makes it feminine and comfortable while still keeping that classic look. it's also easy to dress up or down, which is great! i am 5'4"" and small-framed, and the size 0 fits just right."
1045	1	a	"I love rompers and this one is really cute. i usually wear size 12 but should have got a 10, it runs big. it seems too long, and i'm 5'9"". the prints cute but a little blah. i paid $158 which is too much, since i haven't worn it yet, i should have waited for it to go on sale."
1046	4	a	"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large, xs fit however wasn't flattering"
1047	2	a	I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.
1048	3	a	After reading the reviews, i was hesitant to purchase, but glad i did. i'm usually an xs or s depending on the brand, but i got this in a xxs. it fits perfectly and is so cute. does not look like a bathrobe at all. i love it because it's almost like a cardigan blazer...looks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan!
1049	2	a	I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock, or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing, as i'm fairly skinny, but still curvy, and while i love my curves, i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this, however, is a godsend.
1050	1	a	Saw this dress in the retailer catalog and tried on in store. didn't need a dress but ended up purchasing as will be wearable for summer/early fall. seems like a print dress cut and style that will be used for many seasons. outer fabric is a bit delicate/may snag, and a bit wrinkly as another reviewer said, but works with the dress.
1051	4	a	This print is beautiful and the design is unique and great for work. my only complaint is that it runs huge and the torso fit is extremely boxy. i'm normally in between a size xs and s at retailer, bought the xs in this shirt and it still almost too big.
1052	3	a	"Failed to read website description that vest is polyester shearling-lined.that's on me.  beware: pockets decorative only.  runs a size small due to fact vest is polyester shearling-lined."
1053	4	a	Tried this on in the store and fell in love. it's such a simple shirt but the details are special. runs tts. will get a lot of use out of this.
1054	2	a	I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.
1055	5	a	I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price, but the design really spoke to me. i've been waiting for an off the shoulder piece that i love, and this was it. great, light fabric and beautiful design. i love it. worth every penny. can be worn on or off the shoulder like pictured.
1056	2	a	Cup size is really small for a medium. no way to adjust the back strap. ended up giving it to my daughter. cute but so poorly executed.
1057	0	a	So glad to see high waisted jeans again! very soft, very comfortable, and the raw edge hem makes them just edgy enough!
1058	4	a	I love this blouse. the lace panels are slightly sheer, but nothing inappropriate. the solid fabric is a lovely sort of heavy crepe. stunning bright cobalt blue color. i'm an xl in retailer and this top fit well in xl; ever so slightly snug at one part on the sleeve but nothing noticeable or uncomfortable. be aware, this did bleed blue when it was soaking and it did drip blue water while it was air drying on the hanger. while this blouse is still wet i would stretch out the sides and sleeves to ge
1059	3	a	This coat is just as nice as the russian one from a few years ago, and fits the same. it is stunning! i swear, life is way too short to wear only average coats. if you are a parks and recreation fan, think back to the treat yo self episode.....and you'll know what i mean! i can't say enough wonderful things about this one.
1060	4	a	I really wanted to like this shirt but it doesn't seem to be of that great of quality and is much more sheer than indicated in the photographs. the shirt is very clingy and doesn't hang well. i sent it back
1061	1	a	"This is the most beautiful dress ever! i'm very short and petite with an hourglass figure and a rather large chest. this dress feels like it was made for me. i often have a difficult time finding a dress that flatters my figure and is slimming. i was shocked that it was even a little roomy in the chest. the cut is so beautiful and it is very well made. while the lining might be too short for tall girls, being only 5""1, the lining is perfect. the length in the back is just a teeny bit too long so"
1062	4	a	I purchased this on sale, xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater, but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy, but i would say itchy and cozy!
1063	4	a	This will be my go-to shirt for fall! its a great layering piece with just enough detail to make it different than a plain crew neck long sleeve...the neckline is unique & the slit in the back of the shirt adds interest. fit is slim, nicely tailored which makes it perfect for layering. i will likely purchase more colors once on sale! i purchased the dark grey and color is just as expected. my only drawback is how thin the material is - i can see it getting snags or holes easily, but i will deal
1064	4	a	Just love sweatshirts & ponchos, so what an unusual twist of style! ordered my usual size s during the promo. looks pretty much as in the pic. oversized arm openings are created by a string attached to the sides of the garment. it's ok but may eventually break off. maybe i'll secure w/ snaps or just sew it on by hand. wore it yesterday w/ just a tank underneath to lounge around. later wore for casual dining. it turned cooler & changed to a grey t-shirt underneath along w/ dark blue denim skinnys
1065	4	a	This would be one of my favorite shirts if the neckline were straight across instead of cut, or if it at least had a button. it runs large so the low neck plus bagginess makes it feel too loose for my taste, even though i ordered the xs. the back of the sweater is also really long. it's a comfortable fabric and nice quality though.
1066	5	a	This is an adorably gorgeous swing dress. the fabric is soft and flowy, and everything a swing dress should be. i was concerned that it would be too short, but it's the perfect length-fun while still being classy. a nice, chunky, eccentric bib necklace and nude sandal wedges would complete this outfit beautifully. highly recommend!
1067	1	a	Love this dress. sooo comfortable and flattering. i typically wear a 4-6 in dresses or can be between small and medium depending on style and cut. i went with xs on this dress and it's still very comfortable and loose fitting. the small size fit fine but seemed like too much fabric on the skirt.
1068	0	a	These are super comfy and a great fitting everyday short. the embroidery gives them a nice touch. i am ordering another pair!
1069	4	a	This top is absolutely gorgeous in person. i am usually a size 12 in everything..pants and tops but this one i ended up getting a size 10. definitely size down otherwise the top will slide back on you and the arm holes will be crazy big. but it's a great top for summer. very cool and light. and the v-neck back and front is just so pretty. great buy!
1070	4	a	I was so happy to find this in extra small. it is such a cute loose fitting top.. very soft and flowy tank. the orange color is so pretty. i went down a size in this top
1071	1	a	Cute print got lots of compliments when i wore it. lightweight. looks great with boots
1072	5	a	I picked this dress up from the sales rack at retailer and immediately fell in love when i tried it on. the colors are prettier in person. the cut on the top is a little snug. my bust size is 32b and i got the size 2. i can see the top being an issue for bustier women. overall, wonderful quality and design! i'm wearing it today to combat the 90 degree+ weather.
1073	1	a	"Couldn't make it work, even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan, like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all, just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust), then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy, curvy waist, but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape. (5'3'' 127lb 34a, tried xs)"
1074	4	a	This top is really cute online, but that's about it.  it runs large, but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly.
1075	0	a	"Really like the quality, color, and overall design of these jeans. they ran a little long on me, but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties. i didn't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed. so, glad that was the case given the price tag on them. i am 5'7"", 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed. definitely recommend these jeans"
1076	0	a	I&#39;m 5&#39;3&quot; 118 lbs and the 26 navy fit great.  the gray i can hardly button and are less flattering.  i will order another size 26 in gray to see if it will fit better, but also try a 27.
1077	3	a	Love the fabric. comfortable to wear with jeans or a dress. good for those cool fall mornings.
1078	1	a	I'm an hourglass shape and on me this dress didn't give me any shape at all. and i felt the bell sleeves were a little much. the lining though is really soft and excellent for colder weather. and the print is very pretty, just as pictured.
1079	4	a	"Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once.  got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it's a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits."
1080	4	a	This blouse is so pretty! i love the neck tie which gives it interest and won't look boring on it's own. i'll wear this all-year round. i ordered an xxs which fits perfect.
1081	1	a	My v-shape figure (broad shoulder, narrow hips, waist not well defined) looked completely square in this. not flattering at all. perhaps better for other figures.
1082	1	a	I love this dress but when i put it on i was aghast! the chest was tight and the body was voluminous!! added the pounds which no wants! best left to the waify girls.
1083	0	a	Very cute and true to size if not just a little large up top.
1084	4	a	I'm not much for ponchos, but this one looked unique. it is thin, kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online,, and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.
1085	1	a	"This dress has a beautiful fabric, i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering, absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p, i'm 5'5"" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me."
1086	3	a	As other reviewers have pointed out, this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight, and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve, but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.
1087	2	a	"I'm 5'9"" and these run true to size for the fit but having long legs by the end of the day they start to sag down in the crotch and hit me about mid calf straight out is the package. they wash up perfectly and are cozy. if you're of average height these will probably be your favorite."
1088	1	a	This looks great on the model and is probably beat suited for someone that is tall and thin with small hips.
1089	4	a	"I had read a few reviews on this shirt before ordering that said it ran small and was shorter than it looks. i thought it was worth finding out because i really liked how this shirt looks in the pictures on the store site. unfortunately, when i got it in the mail and opened it up i found out that all the earlier review were right.  it is much shorter than the dimensions implied in the pictures of the model. i was expecting a tunic style shirt that could be worn over leggings or skinny jeans th"
1090	3	a	"Just, you know, in front of my mirror and around the house. i bought this piece because i found it to be a bit funky - so you can wear it with jeans for a night out - yet with classic elements so it could be worn to work with a skirt. also, i live in florida, where it is hot hot hot, but i still like to layer my look. it has an excellent weight to it without being to heavy, so it flows well and can be worn even on the warm days instead of a suit jacket.   i am usually between a small and mediu"
1091	2	a	Very cute and comfortable!does run big, i used the size chart and it's very generous-would order down a size next time.
1092	1	a	Oh i simply can't say enough about this dress... it's just so pretty! i've sometimes had trouble with beaded pieces from retailer but not this dress. it's a very flattering piece and the material is comfortable and soft. really flattering. you can dress it up or down as well - i'm glad i'll be able to wear this into fall with a leather jacket.
1093	1	a	I was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail. the fabric is so comfortable, but the print was overwhelming. it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom. i had to return it.
1094	4	a	I bought the grey t with the design around the yoke. it's cute, but the fabric is a little on the thin side. kind of cheap. i'm glad i didn't pay full price for it. runs true to size.
1095	0	a	These are nice and light weight and comfortable
1096	1	a	I really wanted to like this since i've purchased previous byron lars dresses and have never not been complimented on them. however, the picture on this one is misleading. the colors are extremely bright, which on my pale skin makes me look washed out. for example, the border on the collar is actually more hot pink where in the picture here it appears almost white. the brightness and business just didn't work on me. that being said it still fit like a glove. 5'11 and 145 pounds and the size 4 wa
1097	3	a	This jacket is really cute. i tried in in a large in the store and was too big so i took a chance and ordered medium on line. i have broad shoulders so i was a bit worried. it's perfect. very fitted and cropped. but will look great to throw on over a dress. for reference i'm 5 foot 6 inches and a 34 c. 132lbs. slender but athletic. medium was perfect.
1098	3	a	"When i was purchasing this i asked to myself ""do i really need another black jacket"". when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket. this jacket is special. it is light weight - but structured. it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing. this jacket is my new favorite."
1099	0	a	"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 143 lbs, and 38-32-40 and my normal size 10s fit me perfectly."
1100	4	a	As others have said, this is cropped, so will look funny with most pants that aren't high waisted. i'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it. the lining is adorable, so i don't want to have to send it back.
1101	4	a	Love this top, the lace detailing on it is gorgeous and fits tts. however, the length does run a bit short, not crop top short, but it is shorter than i expected, and i'm s short person.the color is listed as white and as pictured, it also looks white, but it's not. it's definitely an ivory color. i bought a white camisole to wear under it and when the top arrived, the tank didn't match the top.
1102	0	a	These are great jeans and worth every penny. they hug every curve and have just enough give in the places that you need them. i find them to be very figure-flattering and dressed them up with high heeled boots and a nice blouse. even though i'm petite, i ordered a regular in my size (26) because i wanted the length of regular jeans as opposed to ankle length.
1103	4	a	Really love this blouse for several reasons....it fits! pretty true to size depending on how fitted you want it. not too much of a difference between a 6 or 8. it is a bit sheer but i am not worried about it. now my favorite part is the tie in the middle.....finally not a boxy waist, it's up to you to pull it in or loosen. the length is perfect...not too long so it works over skirts too. it is soft. my only concern is how long will it last. will require careful washing and ironing. may end up pu
1104	5	a	The dress is pretty, i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran, i took both back the neck is too tight!
1105	1	a	First, i'm an 8/10 and tried the s and m. i could've worn either but the m looked too large in my opinion. i kept the small. the color- i think you could wear black or navy as the navy is very very dark. the only con- the sleeves. they stick right out to the sides and don't lay down as much as the online photo. it definitely looks best with a cardigan or jacket over it. material is super light.
1106	5	a	I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!
1107	0	a	I'm a huge skort fan from way back, but finding a cute skort is harder than finding a needle in a haystack, so when i saw this on line i was excited, and when i saw it in the store, my hopes were confirmed. this is truly a stylish, functional skort!! the diagnol hem is flattering along with the two buckle details. love the pockets. you even get a little bonus pocket. the fabric is a beautiful color (moss) and soft, so it hangs in a flattering manner, instead of bunching up. this skort looks grea
1108	0	a	"I'm 5'3"" and 160 pounds with short legs and got a large petite. it fits really well (a tiny bit too short but could just be my proportions) and the quality seems very high. definitely can be dressed up or down (good for a business casual work environment)."
1109	0	a	"Nice dark indigo with minimal fading. medium denim thickness, with stretch. i bought size 25 and it is snug, but doesn't squeeze. my hip is 34.5"" and 28"" waist. love these. i will be getting them hemmed up to ankle length. i am 5' 5"" and find the little kick out at the ankle (from getting them shortened) to be very cute and classy. if you keep them full length to your shoe, they will have a slightly baggier bootcut look. these remind me of my point sur hightower straight leg jeans, with maybe an"
1110	1	a	I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail, i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online, the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat, i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!
1111	0	a	Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper, trouser-like pant--this is not it!
1112	4	a	Great quality, i didn't expect the neck to be so wide but it still looks nice.
1113	1	a	"I have a shorter torso and so i usually love dresses that hit right at my waist- so this dress seemed perfect!  i ordered a size 2 petite, which fit very well. the regular two (in picture) was not as well made. the straps didn't fit as well. they were less of an ""x"" and way more fabric. petite fit great. i think this dress is really fun but not very mature. i returned it because it didn't feel adult enough for the event."
1114	4	a	I ordered this top on sale and so glad that i did. i am usually a small in tops, but had read that it runs small. i went with a medium and wish that i picked the small. it is definitely a swing top. it's best feature is the detailing; it's gorgeous. i paired it with jeans and a white denim jacket.
1115	4	a	I bought this top in slate. it is very nice, looks so flattering and good with a light pant. it runs large though and is loose fitting, like a swing top. i like the design at the top. i will try the mauve in the store. i really like this top and recommend it for casual wear. very comfortable and soft.
1116	4	a	I love this shirt. i wore it once and it is so cute on - the problem came from washing. i washed once and made sure i washed on gentle. i took it out of the washer and hung it to dry and noticed that there was now a tiny hole in the body of the shirt. i am planning to exchange this and hoping it doesn't happen again!
1117	4	a	This shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures. it is short and very wide. i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid.
1118	4	a	I like wearing leggings with this sweater with its blanket like proportions. so soft and comfy! have only experienced minor shedding, nothing problematic.
1119	4	a	Very cool top! i purchased this in the black, which is more of a very dark gray (imagine sanded silk). it's very figure flattering and accentuates curves. it also disguises any minor tummy issues. not to clingy, but follows your form. the fabric is well made with a perfect drape to match the style. definitely a winner!
1120	0	a	I recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shown--and is actually a nice touch to make these different!  the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips.  i wear a 10-12 and the l is fine but i wouldn't want them any smaller.  super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute!
1121	3	a	When i first tried it on, i was worried it would add 10-15 lbs to my hourglass frame, but if worn correctly, it actually has a flattering, slimming effect. i recommend wearing it open (like in the photo) with the same type of outfit underneath...looks very chic! or, to give yourself a defined waist, use the provided ribbon belt tied to the side or use your own large, statement belt. also looks great with vintage sunglasses! the fabric quality can't be beat. it's nice and heavy to the touch. i ca
1122	0	a	"I wanted to comment about the wash. yes, these jeans look really ?dirty? when you pull them out of the package. but after a few months of washing, the dirty color has really mellowed. also, i am a usual 26 in jeans, purchased these in 25 and could have fit into  the 24. i may purchase another pair, these jeans are really unique, comfortable, great  for the summer with sandals or converse."
1123	4	a	This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders
1124	5	a	This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem, loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it's really too bad, it's such a pretty combination of patterns.
1125	2	a	"I'm still on the fence about these. i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker. they just feel too flimsy and too much like i'm ready for bed. i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasn't wearing pjs. i just can't get past that. they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear.  i ordered the small which fit fine. i wear 4-6 in retailer pants. i got the p"
1126	0	a	These pants are very cute for spring/summer, and i enjoy having the option of a looser silhouette with a bit of length (nearly all of my pants are a cropped skinny these days!). i agree with the other reviews that have described the leg as being less straight-legged than they are pictured. on me, they have a subtle flare -- nothing major, but just enough to break perfectly over my shoe. they fit tts on me, but i did need to have the hem taken up. i'm 100 lbs, 5'0 and the 0p fits perfectly. i hav
1127	0	a	Despite being a knit, this skirt holds its shape and is absolutely perfect. it goes with everything and is extremely comfortable.
1128	1	a	"This dress has a nice soft fabric and pretty details in the stitching and there is a matching slip with adjustable straps that snaps onto the inside shoulders. i found the length in petite to be fine but the loose fit to be unflattering for me as a short person (5'1""). however, the photos here on the website with the model are quite accurate- you can see exactly how it fits loose through the waist. if that's what you are looking for, go for it, but personally i didn't find it to ""do anything"" fo"
1129	5	a	I got this dress for my younger sister who's in the process of losing weight. she's currently wearing a size 12 with comfort room but can occasionally squeeze into smaller sizes depending on the product. this dress is deceptively true to size. at first glance it looks like a roomy dress but the inner part of the dress zips up real tight. as a result, the boxy top part of the dress doesn't look too big and is in fact very flattering. the dress is very silky and looks as high quality as its price.
1130	0	a	Love these! they are my new favorite weekend pant. they are comfortable, versatile, and cute. the fit and cut are great too. a must have for your wardrobe.
1131	1	a	I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.
1132	0	a	"This jumpsuit is fabulous in person! it is elegant and easy and very figure flattering. i have a very curvy shape but a 34 ddd bust so i would say i am a top heavy hourglass. this jumpsuit does me right. the only thing i would say is i don't think it would be very comfortable on a person with a long torso. i am 5'3"" and bought this in 6 regular and the length is perfect with heels. but the whole top half fits me perfectly but shows alot of boob if i'm not careful. but i don't think it would be s"
1133	0	a	"Okay, these are seriously the cutest black jeans i've ever put on my body. i can't say enough positive things about them. sure, the color bleeds a little (like the previous review stated), but they're black jeans. i haven't encountered a single pair of designer black jeans that don't have some color transfer.   also, these jeans are really stretchy which makes them a dream to wear.   here is my one complaint -- i am normally a size 29-30 depending upon brand, cut etc. i had to size down to a"
1134	4	a	I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can't lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas.
1135	4	a	Love the look! it's a little tight but i still like it.
1136	4	a	I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin, and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material, but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric, with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex
1137	4	a	I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans, and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like, but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer, i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.
1138	0	a	"I tried on these pants and was instantly in love. they are very flattering and stylish, but also incredibly comfortable. i am 5' 6"", and the length is perfect to wear with 3"" heels. i highly recommend these!"
1139	3	a	I recently purchased this vest and unlike other reviews, i found it to be tts. with that being said, i am typically a medium in retailer tops or 8/10. i have broad shoulders (5'9, 145lbs). i purchased the medium and it fit perfect through the shoulders. it is meant to be flowy and gives some volume in a good way. if that's the look you are going for this is the top for you. had i gone down a size, i would not have been able to hook the top. i am going to be wearing this with blue jeans and white s
1140	4	a	This top is so lovely, i was worried of the color on my pale skin, but it is complementary, nice warm tones. yes, it is a tank, but i can see this as a transition piece into fall with a nice blazer, jeans, boots... the xs regular is perfect for me, length is adequate. if i were to go with petite, i might think it is too short. it is flowy, but still has shape, more than a swing top, so very flattering. the back is really cute too, definitely need a strapless for me, due to the thin straps...
1141	2	a	"Cute bright colored suit a little more orange than pink i prefer pink but the fit didn't quite work for me    the bottoms were a little too big and the top although was fairly well proportioned just didn't look right altogether    purchase the extra smalls in both  and have since returned    i do love the suits that retailer has been offering would just love to be able to try them on in the store  nice quality good colors"
1142	1	a	I wasn't overly impressed or drawn to this dress at first, even after i bought it, but after wearing it, i am sold! i paired the orange version with caramel colored sandals and gold jewelry. i thought it was necessary to wear a long necklace to bring some interest to the otherwise plain top. the dress is super comfortable - fabric, fit and length. it billows in such a pretty way when you walk! the color also made my skin look extra tan, which i loved! the waist is short and rides up now and then
1143	1	a	I ordered this after seeing the rave reviews. it is not for me. just like the culottes i ordered, this romper makes me feel like a grandma. i said i'd recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again, this was not for me. i also didn't like the back of the romper. no way i could even get away with a racerback bra b/c it's so low cut. the good though- it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric. tts also. i'm a med 8/10 and the medium was correct in this.
1144	4	a	Must wear tank under or i feel immodest due to eyelet holes. beautiful. i'm machine washing w delicates n hang dry. comes out great. easy breezy.
1145	4	a	This top is a lovely combination of rugged and refined and will be versatile wear for a party pared with nice pants and flats to casual with jeans and boots. it appears well made though i had to size up for my broad shoulders but other hh tops fit the same way.
1146	1	a	"I wanted to love this dress.....the reviews were great, the price was right and i needed a simple black dress. the fabric (jersey) is lovely and drapes nicely and the print was pretty. unfortunately, the armholes were way too long and low for me and even with a black bra, i was sharing more of my lingerie than i wanted. perhaps someone with a slightly smaller chest could size down and avoid oversharing! for reference, i am 5'5"", 145 and wear a 30gg bra. i ordered the m."
1147	4	a	The fabric is really gorgeous, and the lining is lovely and soft. unfortunately being on the petite (short) side, it just didn't look quite right on me. i felt a little swallowed up. i wish it had worked because it's so lovely!!
1148	4	a	"This sweater is very comfortable and soft. unlike other reviewer, i did not find the lace to be itchy. i'm 5'4"", usually size 6; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel. this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted. it's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy. not sure how it's going to handle the wash."
1149	4	a	This sweater is like a giant hug. i wore it today and received so many compliments.
1150	4	a	This top runs large... an entire size. i am on the fence about it.. it is quite *stylish* and well made. it is fairly heavy and seems like it would be very warm. the burgundy color is nice. the issue i am having with it is the way the lower black arms are sewn in the upper arms. it just seems somewhat *odd*. overall though, it is very *forgiving*,especially with the black border around the entire bottom. it is the perfect top to showcase a great long necklace and it would be great with leggings
1151	0	a	I ordered these leggings and loved them, for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant, leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.
1152	5	a	The print is unique and fun. however, the longer length and heavier weight of the fabric was not the piece i needed in my closet.
1153	4	a	This top is just adorable! so comfy and cute. i love the cut and how it goes a little longer in the back. i will be wearing this a lot!
1154	5	a	"Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4"", 110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green, the red is much more red than rust colored, etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm, but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store."
1155	4	a	"This is a really nice top, especially for the price. i am 5'6"", 34dd, 140 lbs and normally wear a medium in dolan tops. in this top i purchased size small since the gathered front provides ample room for my bust. some reviewers have found this top to be on the ""boxy"" side. i can see that if you don't size down as i did. i found the medium to have too much fabric and look very baggy whereas the small was perfect. i do wish this top was a tad bit longer and less sheer, though. white tops should be"
1156	1	a	Love this dress. the fabric is super soft and flowy. be aware that the model is a tall gal.... i'm usually a size 8/10 in dresses and purchased a large. returned it for a large petite as it went way past my knees. looks funny if it is below the knee. the petite is perfect.
1157	4	a	This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.
1158	1	a	This dress does fit small.. i am generally a size 10-12 in maeve but purchased this in a 14. i have a large chest (34g) which contributed to my need to size up. the green color is beautiful and the dress looks darling on. i have a little trouble with the zipper but nothing that required me to return the dress. my biggest complaint is that the straps are a tiny bit too long and don't lie flat on my shoulders. other than that i receive a ton of compliments every time i wear it!
1159	2	a	"The ruching on this suit is super flattering. i ordered the medium -- i am 5' 6"", 150 lbs, and usually a solid ""medium"" in most retailer items -- though i would definitely recommend sizing up with this guy. i was able to get it on (and it certainly held everything in place), but since it is a one piece, pulling it on was a bit of a struggle and i certainly could have used about an inch more fabric from top to bottom. i will be returning and exchanging for a large."
1160	1	a	The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality.
1161	1	a	"The fabric and its texture didn't meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric...  however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears."
1162	4	a	Love this crinkle cotton top for spring. the print is great and i can't wait to wear it!
1163	4	a	This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on, it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side, gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also, it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.
1164	1	a	I ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening. after seeing the other reviews i wasn't sure about it, but i was very pleased when it arrived. i find it is elegant and sexy, but also modest enough when i sized up by 1. i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly. it is form-fitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight. i'm excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace.
1165	2	a	"The wide strap style is very flattering. this tank is fitted in my normal size small, it fits like the model in the cobalt blue color. i'm 5'7"" 120lbs. if you want more room, i'd size up. it is low cut, but not inappropriately so. fits like the picture shows."
1166	1	a	This is a very beautiful summer dress with plenty of lightweight fabric. i loved the colors and the design. i know that some other reviewer complained that this is polyester, and it is, but it feels like chiffon. the only two complaints i have are- 1. the dress is large, so go a size smaller than you would normally, and 2. this is dry clean only! if this is polyester, why would they suggest that it should be dry cleaned only? that is going to take a chunk out of the budget to get it cleaned. oth
1167	0	a	I'm petite, but even if i weren't, i think this runs very large, isn't form flattering at all, and overall looks dull. it most definitely does not justify the price. material is thin.
1168	1	a	I really love this dress. it runs very true to size and is nice and long, but could be easily hemmed. i am 5'10' and have room for heels. the waist runs just slightly high and causes a slight flare out of the fabric at the hips but it is not a deal breaker. the cotton is super light weight and perfect for summer. some jersey fabric maxi 's can be super hot. i was surprised by the cost for the actual quality of the dress.
1169	4	a	When i walked into my local retailer, two of the saleswomen were wearing this stunning top in totally different ways, and i knew it would be the perfect gift for my mom. unfortunately the small was sold out, but they were able to order it online and have it sent. gorgeous medium-to-lightweight fabric that looks great out or tucked in.
1170	4	a	I first saw this sweater coat in the retailer catalog that i got in the mail. i thought it was beautiful. so ethereal! i never thought that i would own it, though because of the initial price. i never thought it would make it to clearance. to my surprise, it did, and then went the extra 30% off! i took the plunge. i followed the advice of the other reviewers, and ordered a size down, a small. i am glad that i did. i still feel like i get the oversized, wrapped in warmth feel. it is not a figure fl
1171	4	a	Awesome light shrug. goes with so many out fits, over tees and dresses. tts. get one! orange color is a pretty neutral.
1172	4	a	I am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me. sleeves were especially long.
1173	0	a	The fit, the length, the color, the fabric... cannot say anything negative at all! the sales associates at the store where i tried them on said they had just gotten them in, and she could not wait to see how they looked on. they were just as awed as i was! the pants can easily be dressed up or down.. the brown color is so, so, beautiful! i would expect these to be twice the price for such a high quality pant.  i consider it a timeless cut and can worn for seasons to come.
1174	4	a	This sweater is gorgeous! the color is a true periwinkle which really attracted me to it. the bell sleeves are a nice change. i have very long arms and they fit perfectly. i could wear this sweater out.
1175	4	a	"This top is very cute and appears in person just as it does in the picture. fits true to size and the item is made well. i had many complements and it was fun to wear!  unfortunately, i did have to iron it right out of the bag."
1176	1	a	I agree with the other two reviews. it is so disappointing that this adorable dress isn't lined. the fabric is paper thin! this is an a-line style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy. i sized down to a petite xs. i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it. i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size.
1177	4	a	"I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small. i have to totally disagree with the reviewer! i find that this top runs true to size or even generous! the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual! i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit (5""2"", broad shoulders, 120 lb)"
1178	4	a	"It's always sunny when i wear this sunshine yellow tee.  love the color and they way it was pieced together.  has a flattering feminine fit whole still feeling relaxed and casual.  it's slightly sheer but not obscene.  all linen and a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i purchased medium and i'm 39/28/35 140# 5'3"""
1179	3	a	Love this blazer. you can wear it with anything. fits well and lightweight. perfect for south florida.
1180	4	a	I've been stalking this top online and finally went into the store today to see it.  i'm so glad i did!  the colors are very vibrant and the material is soft and very lightweight.  the cut covers a regular bra pretty well (a big plus!) and makes my arms look good!  i can't wait to wear this, it will be a perfect dressy top for the higher heat days!
1181	4	a	I purchased this in the coral color and i am very happy with it. i find it to run true to size, has a nice stretch to it, but fits close to the body. the coral is gorgeous and looks very nice with my olive skin. the only odd thing i have found is the sweater seems to have random darker fibers. i looked at all of them in this color in store and they all had some dark fibers... strange. but, i have worn a few times already and i am very happy.
1182	1	a	I've admired the various iterations of this dress and finally found one in the sale room, much to my delight! i'm generally a sale shopper, so this doesn't mean i didn't think it was priced well. i have the oatmeal top with yellow/gold/orange pattern on the skirt in xs. the small fits comfortably up top, but on my petite frame, the top just looked too big, so i went with xs. i suppose the straps are a bit confusing, but their easy to figure out if you just look at them for a moment before puttin
1183	1	a	This dress is as stunning in person as it is in these pictures! i'm petite, and so it's longer on me than it is on the model. i got a 4p and the waist was perfect! i thought it might look matronly as it was longer, but it looks classic. i feel like i could dress it down just a bit with flats and a cardi, or wear it to an event with heals and a wrap. it's so comfortable and forgiving in the waist and belly area, which is icing on the cake! i had absolutely no reason to buy it, but once i tried it
1184	1	a	I am 5'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress, but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift, and she was right. not worth the price on sale.
1185	0	a	Cute romper, love the pattern but the material seems cheap and flimsy, and is staticky! for the price it should be better quality. also i'm fairly short and hits high on the leg. not sure how anyone taller could make it work.
1186	4	a	I love this tunic. i am 22 weeks pregnant and the large fit great. i wish it were a little longer but will be great with leggings and perfect for the fall/winter seasons.
1187	4	a	Remember those cable-knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties?! that's exactly what this sweater is. everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere. i'll pass on this!
1188	4	a	I bought this top last week and absolutely love it! it hides my muffin top and falls in all the right places. it does not cling, but is very flattering for my size 12-14 body.
1189	4	a	"Beautiful detail, soft drapey fabric. but it pulls funny from where they added stitching at the top of the v. for me it was also a little short but i have a long torso. i'm 5'7"" 155lbs and the size medium fit nicely with the exception of the length."
1190	1	a	The fabric is nice and could pass for silk even though it is viscose-rayon. the pattern is pretty and flattering. sadly, the fit was just off- big in the center but tight at the hips. if i size up the v-neck might be too wide. i'm disappointed that i'll have to return it. it probably would look great on a different body type. i would recommend it for apple body types but not for pear body types.
1191	0	a	"I just purchased these pants in red on sale. i am 5/5"", 143 pounds, and the 10 fit perfectly (i am either an 8 or a 10 in pants, depending upon brand). it is really hard for me to find pants that are cute, unique, work-appropriate, and flattering. these pants fit the bill in all aspects. i thought i would prefer the black, but am really glad i got the red."
1192	0	a	"I bought these shorts in my usual size small (4-6) 38"" around hips/butt. they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way, especially given the drapey fabric they're made out of. the print is gorgeous, especially at the waistband. you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off. the red is a true bright red but beautiful. the waistband has a functional drawstring. i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying. i would not put these in a dry"
1193	1	a	I ordered the large since the med wasn't available and it didn't complement my figure because it was too loose all over. i like the design detail with off-center buttons and the fabric is a nice quality.
1194	2	a	These leggings are so thick and soft! they feel like velvet on your skin. i am so, so happy with my purchase, and would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a unique, comfortable, and quality pair of leggings.
1195	0	a	I just received these jeans and the fit it good. but they smell like moth balls and i have washed them twice already. i hope it will go away, otherwise i wasted $100.
1196	4	a	This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger, a nice blue, and a good transition piece. but, the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin, but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it, but sadly, i just don't think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms, i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work, but for me at least, i think it
1197	1	a	"I loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives. the grey color is drab, yet leaves room for creativity. it's stylish yet wrinkles horribly. i am 5' 2"" so it hangs too low in the front and armpits. another reviewer mentioned the buttons, yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest. the pockets are a great space for hands, yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits, so will not hold much. i typically wear a 4 petite and the small fits"
1198	2	a	"I purchased these bottoms with the matching peplum top in romantic floral. i also purchased the higher waisted bottoms just in case.  i returned the higher bottoms and that's saying a lot.  i have two sons and now struggle with fit in regard to two piece bathing suits.  the higher bottoms just didn't fit right and i didn't need the extra coverage because these fit so well and the peplum gives extra coverage, though not really necessary.  the others cut in a bit in the seat and hips and these"
1199	0	a	Great chinos, but they run a size large. i ordered my normal pants size and had to return them for one size down. i actually like them so much after finding the right size, i bought a second pair in store. i have the grey and mustard yellow. love them! just order a size down!
1200	1	a	I got this when it went on sale (in navy and coral colors), awesome dress for any occasion! as far as complaints go about the straps, its meant to be low-cut! i really like the basket weave bodice although that does make it more difficult to zip up, but i found it was easier to just slip the dress on zipped up since the stretchy fabric gives quite a bit rather than deal with the zipper. i normally wear about a 0-2 in most retailer brands and have the dress in both sizes (didn't notice a big differ
1201	0	a	These are awesome! i have the pink which is a very light faded sort of color. they are beautiful and very nice quality. they are slimmer and stretchier then i imagined but very flattering.
1202	1	a	This dress is incredible soft and flattering. it sits higher on the waist than most other dresses i've received from retailer, which is actually great for me, as i have a short torso. i have been able to put it in with the regular wash cycle, which was a pleasant surprise. the only issue was with the overlapping fabric on the top; i ended up adding an extra stitch to avoid being totally exposed.
1203	4	a	I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8, and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight, but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d
1204	4	a	This is the perfect tank for everyday but it looks like you've dressed up a bit. i love the flow and the ruffles and it looks super cute with a pair of skinny pants. really comfortable and it is good quality.
1205	4	a	This top is really cute. the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it. the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top. i was afraid it might make it too stiff & bulky around the shoulders, but it doesn't. very cute. the armholes are cut on the bigger side, but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anything.(just comfortable) the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming. runs pretty tts. i ordered my usual medium and it's not quite as form fitting
1206	4	a	Went to the local store today for something else and left with this in the cream color. it is just simply awesome. i could have worn the s but felt that the m would be a little better. i'm between a s and m most of the time. can't say enough good things about the quality and versatility of this sweater. great piece for cooler summer nights and for a cover up for pilates/yoga. can't wait to wear it and now i'm tempted by the teal.
1207	1	a	As the other reviewers stated, it does run large, i sized down 1 size and it's perfect. great dress to wear so many ways.
1208	2	a	There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect, the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening, and the cut (length, wide straps, and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure, skin color, and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...
1209	1	a	I am kicking myself for listening to an earlier negative review and not ordering this dress months ago. i finally took a chance on clearance and i love it! the knit fabric is soft and beautiful! so is the design and construction. the fabric is very light and delicate. all the details on the dress are just top notch. the body of the dress is lined, but the sleeves are not - so there's a slight see-through effect on the sleeves, showing the lovely and delicate knit. it fits like a dream, and i've
1210	3	a	Super cute jacket .perfect for fall i can't stop wearing it
1211	3	a	I could seriously sleep in this--it's that soft! i dressed this with a white tee and holey jeans then i wore it to work today over a blue midi dress. love this jacket!!!
1212	0	a	Don't size down, as one reviewer recommended. you'll wind up trying to exchange. the colors are beautiful and the front panel has a lot of texture. it's a great find.
1213	4	a	This is a closet staple! loose fitting, but lovely. well made!
1214	4	a	"The retailer by me actually had this and i had to try it on. my thoughts below: ___________ pros: - well-constructed with lining underneath to avoid the need of a cami or tank. no see-through issues whatsoever. - the fabric is great quality and looks nicely sewn. no fraying or strays seen on the 2 sizes i tried. - there's a back zipper that goes from top to bottom at the back. unusual as i don't see why that's needed since you can just slip it over your head. - front ""v slit"" isn't too low or reve"
1215	1	a	"I loved this dress when i saw it. however the fit was way off. i am 5'7"" 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down. when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect. unfortunately the waist hit way too high, above my rib cage and the dress was too short. it was as if it was a petite size. i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty, easy dress to just throw on for school. unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both. the material is also not the s"
1216	0	a	"Rompers are usually tough for me. i am petite, especially on top (5'2"", 110 lbs, 34a), but have a healthy butt and hips, which can make sizing difficult. in this romper, i tried a regular xs, and found the fit very flattering. the top was blouse-y on me, but not overly so, and the arm holes didn't gape, which is usually an issue for me with non-petite sizing. the elastic waistband is also great, as you can adjust it to hit you in a flattering spot and keep the shorts from being too short (which"
1217	1	a	"I love this dress in the fact that it isn't low cut, isn't several inches above the knee - and bam it has sleeves! the length is gracious and the all over print flattering for a full figure. the skirt has a wonderful swing to it. i'm 5'4"" and 165, so i ordered the 12 regular. it does fit (and has stretch to the fabric), however it is too long in the torso on me. so much so that the low waist seam pops up and the zipper bumps out when i move around. i pulled up the top by an inch or two and the d"
1218	4	a	I loved the look of this shirt but full price was a little steep so i waited for it to go on sale and am glad i waited because only a l was left and it was perfect fit since i originally was thinkng of getting a small or medium which i usually do at retailer but this one was running really small compared to retailer other shirts. the fabric is great but when i looked at it carefully, the zipper construction is sewn poorly as well as the sewing at the buttons area...also, there were a lot of thread h
1219	0	a	These are great pants, have them in the green holly color
1220	1	a	"I purchased this dress on super sale and i'm so happy i did. it looks better on me than on the model and that's never the case. the material is soft corduroy with comfortable give. it moves with me. true to size (i ordered a size 8 and for reference, i'm 5'2"", 140lbs, 36c). love this staple fall/winter piece. i wore it to a conference for work with footless tights and a black cardigan. i can't say enough how comfortable it is on! it has a structured give if that makes any sense. love it!"
1221	4	a	"This is a great long sleeve, casual shirt for spring - soft and airy. pairs well with jeans. i found that it fit me just right. i'm not very tall, but my shoulders are a little broad for my height, which typically puts me in the ""small/medium"" range, so i got size 6 regular. this hits just below the hip and the shoulders are spot on. very flattering yolk that gives a little contour to the bust. gauzy fabric has wrinkled texture which gives it a casual look and feel. my only problem is there aren"
1222	2	a	I purchased this top in the oatmeal/beige color. i love it. the material is very soft and it fits true to size. i would have purchased the black color too if it was still available.
1223	1	a	This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.
1224	1	a	If you have a love for vintage, romantic, feminine attire, this is the dress for you. it evokes memory of days gone by. it isn't just beautiful, the quality is superb. make sure you check the measurements for this little beauty has so stretch to it.
1225	0	a	Cute colored jeans.  ordered the sky color & when it arrived,  the color was a medium moss green color.  the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them.
1226	1	a	Thank you retailer for a collection that includes dressy mid-length dresses suitable for special occasions! the simplistic beauty, quality of workmanship, and form fitting style of this dress is perfect. the fit and flare enhances curves and hides flaws. it pairs perfectly with the necklace shown and a cropped lace front cardigan that i found elsewhere. admittedly, i am not sure that younger clients would be happy with the tea length, but i am ecstatic!
1227	4	a	I bought this tank on a whim without trying it on in the store, in black. the detail on the front is cute and the peplum is really cute without being frumpy at all. i am usually a small, ocassionally a medium in retailer shirts and i bought this in small. it fits but i feel like i could have gone up to a medium, it's just a little tight across the chest, but i do have more broad shoulders than most so maybe it's just because of that. the fabric is nice and stretchy, so i might be able to get away
1228	0	a	I bought these in 'vintage sage' and i grab for them as often as my favorite skinny jeans. if you are just dipping your toe in colored pants i would reccomend the same color, it is undertsated and easily paired with so many other colors. the legs run a little big but the waist is tru to size, so for comfort i went with my usual size.
1229	1	a	The design of this dress is very cute, but if you have an average to large bust, don't even think about it. returned, unfortunately.
1230	4	a	"The black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful. the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color. it simply did not match. it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color. the fit was ""ok"". just didn't love it."
1231	0	a	"I was a little hesitant to buy these given that i am just 5'1"" - i didn't want to look like an extra from the set of ""newsies."" but these are very well made and tailored for a woman's body...the trousers actually accentuate the waist and the cropped leg works well for a petite frame. they are nicely lined and the wool blend is soft and not scratchy. i love them!"
1232	2	a	I wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm. they get the job done and for an incredible price. they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside. i'm not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but it's subtle and i don't mind it. they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots, the length not a problem. my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg. retailer kindly sent me a new pair for
1233	4	a	This top runs larger so size down. i love it besides that. it's adorable!
1234	4	a	Love this top! i just purchased this shirt from my local retailer store. i noticed it when i walked in and saw it on display. it's stylish, comfortable, and subtle. it runs large so size down. normally, i wear a medium in retailer tops but needed a small. the flower print is small and the colors are muted against the black. pairs well with several colors: black (like model), dark denim, olive green, and mauve. the display had it tucked into a soft khaki colored pair of pants that worked as well.
1235	0	a	The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip, it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it wasn't see through i would keep it.
1236	4	a	This shirt feels amazing. it also drapes nicely and is very feminine and flattering. great versatile piece.
1237	4	a	This top looks great with a long straight skirt (the grey with a black skirt....) and skinny jeans. i can understand why the style might not work for everyone but for me it's a perfect blend of elegant and funky. i'm sometimes a medium sometimes a large and the medium work well for me, so if in doubt size down
1238	1	a	I just got this dress in the beige color and i absolutely love it. the fit is perfect and i feel that it is just the right length. i got a small and i am 5'9''. the pockets are a great touch and really are the key for tunic style dresses for me. i love the soft material and could live in this dress. such a great staple for my closet!
1239	4	a	I was a little  hesitant to order it.  i am glad i did, it is a great top.
1240	4	a	"Wow... i'm in love!!! when i first saw this i put it in my cart... when i went back to purchase it, it was sold out in my size... i was so bummed. i kept checking back and saw it was restocked so i quickly ordered it... thank heavens!!! when i first took it out of the box i thought it might be too ""grandma-y"" of a design... but i was wrong. it's just gorgeous! can totally be dressed up or down. so flattering. love love love it!!!"
1241	4	a	I ordered the orange color online and was very happy with the product when it arrived. it's a soft orange color, perfect for fall. the shirt is thin and probably will need a cami underneath, but it's longer in the back than the front and will go great with leggings or skinny jeans.
1242	4	a	"The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction."
1243	4	a	Great mock neck fits well and looks great with pants and skirts!! also love the dark grey color!!
1244	4	a	Love this top! tried it on in store...so glad i did since it runs large and i had to size down to a medium. the color is a beautiful camel and the material is soft...very grateful the fabric content did not contain dreaded wool, lol! therefore leaving it soft and comfortable to wear...the price tag was a bit much considering it is only a sweater vest but with retailer price equals quality so i don't mind spending the extra $!
1245	1	a	Cute dress that is perfect for a casual summer wedding or brunch with friends. i love the material and that the dress is lined. it is very comfortable and it has pockets. this is definitely more of a ?golden? yellow vs. a soft yellow. my only complaint is that i wish it were cinched more right below the bust. it would give the dress (and me) more shape. i would say this dress is true to size but if you have a larger chest, you will likely want to size up. if you have a small chest, i would proba
1246	0	a	"This is a lot shinier in person, and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size. there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side. due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band, it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy."
1247	4	a	I love this shirt!  it's super comfy and i love the design and detail.  it does run large, so order a size down.
1248	1	a	"I wore this dress for christmas and agree that it is beautiful (i received many compliments), while i agree that this sweater dress is beautiful, i'm a little worried about the quality. after just a day of wearing it, it seemed to have lost it's shape. the bottom hem of the dress looked stretched out and it sagged slightly all over. i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and my typical size is a m/4 and the dress fit perfectly initially, but not so much by christmas dinner. i'm not giving up on it because i was still"
1249	0	a	"I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more ""denim"" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser, less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie."
1250	0	a	"I tried on the grey version in store, and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee, which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5'4"" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however, the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable."
1251	0	a	"I was so surprised to find this in the sale. it is beautiful. light and airy while lined. the color is bright and fun. it is so comfortable. i ordered an xs based on reviews (this is my typical size in this type of style) and it fit great. i ordered the regular length even though i am only 5'4"". i am about 120#. will be an easy ""go to"" skirt to throw on for a casual look or can be dressed up. did i mention comfortable?"
1252	1	a	Great dress - fits tts (i am a 6p and purchased a sp). looks good with boots or ballet flats.
1253	1	a	I purchased this in london, early april, and i wore it to a summer wedding. it was perfect and hangs very nicely. the colors are rich and the deep blue flowers have texture. the front slit goes up to about the knee but doesn't split apart when walking which i appreciated. the only thing that i felt was a little off was the circumference of the sleeves. i have to keep them unbuttoned but thankfully it looks like just an interesting detail and not so much like an unbuttoned sleeve. a definite keep
1254	2	a	I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.
1255	2	a	I wish there were 100 colors, i'd buy them all. the white is super sheer, but i'll use it as a bottom layer for something.
1256	4	a	"I was pleasantly surprised by this beautiful sweater! being that it's a wool blend, i thought it would be itchy against my skin. to my surprise, it is quite the opposite. very cozy and soft, with plenty of ""wiggle room"". i'm very tall and having enough length for my arms is always a concern. the sleeves are long and comfortable. this sweater is quickly becoming one of my new favorite ""go to"" pieces!"
1257	0	a	"I love skorts! so when i saw this online i ordered my usual size 6. arrived today & really cute. fit is good w/ some room to spare. almost too big but i'll stick w/ the 6. looks as in the pic except the lower front part & the back has a metallic sparkly fiber in the fabric. not shown in the pic though. it's understated but attractive. the fabric patches give this skort a special uniqueness. casual or a little dressy, just love... 5'3"", 117#."
1258	4	a	I have discovered that i'm really picky about t-shirts. it's hard to find a cute, flattering one that you can wear with whatever. this one is perfect. the neckline is different, the sleeves are short -- almost cap sleeves. it fits nicely everywhere. i am an 8/10 and the medium fit well. i love that it's a dark enough color and not sheer (why are so many of your clothes see through, retailer?!!!) , so i don't have to layer something under it just to wear it. it's thin enough that you can wear it in
1259	0	a	These jeans are amazing! i just got them from retailer the other day and i have worn them almost every day since! i have washed them once. the tag says to turn inside out, wash in cold, and hang dry. i was a little skeptical that they'd still be soft without the dryer/dryer sheets, but they are wonderful and do not stretch out. i will get lots of use out of them and i just wish they made them in more colors. they're very comfortable: i totally love the high rise. they're a little long but i
1260	4	a	I was excited to receive this top. it looked great online, vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves. when i tried it on, the fabric looked and felt cheap. it is not a flowy top. do not recommend it.
1261	4	a	Absolutely love this sweater! it is a tad bit large. i bought it in a medium but because i like the loose fit i will keep it. it is very light and great for the summer. i've only worn it once so far and received many compliments on it. great quality as well!
1262	1	a	This dress looks so plain on this model you'd never guess it looks so adorable on. i saw it as i walked into my local retailer and tried it on quickly over skinny jeans i was wearing with grey suede boots and it looked amazing! it's a perfect teacher dress. wear it over tights or jeans during colder weather, chunky sandals during warmer weather. it has side pockets i absolutely love. you must try it on to believe it. the fabric is soft and of great quality.
1263	0	a	I loved this but couldn't believe how small it was.
1264	1	a	I got this for a special event and while i had to special order due to it not being in my local store yet, the minute i tried it on was very happy with the fit, feel and overall look. at the event i got so many compliments and love the way it fits - attractive, sturdy and very comfortable to wear, even with kicking up my heels on the dance floor. am so happy i got this and plan to wear it to other events coming up (weddings, parties, etc.)
1265	4	a	I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua, but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it's pretty boxy and it's hard to tell from the photo, but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it), but that's based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size, but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide).
1266	0	a	I love the feminine feel and look of this skirt. it is unique and matches many different shirts and looks great with a jacket. the only thing is it does run large. i ordered a 6 (my usual size) and it is very loose, not form fitting like the photo, but still cute and wearable. downsizing would've been better.
1267	0	a	Great boyfriend style jeans. run large, though - i had to order a size down.
1268	4	a	"As other reviewers have noted, this is a pretty top. i really love the design. alas, however, it is too big for my frame. for reference i am barely 5'1"" and about 105 lbs. i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me. it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place. the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits. i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp. i am going to have to part with it, sadly."
1269	0	a	I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim and bought it immediately. finding a jumpsuit for my body type is hard (small chest, rounder in the middle and hips like whoa) but i have to say this one is ridiculously flattering. love the quality and feel of the fabric. i've worn it both braless and with a bandeau and have not needed to wear a shirt underneath, but then again it isn't a piece i plan to wear to work. i'm usually a sz 8/10 and got the medium regular which is perfect. i'm 5'5 and the bottom hit
1270	4	a	"I have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer, and this is not it. like others, it's just so thin and sheer. i live in the south. i don't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything. this is fine to layer in cooler temps, but now in our horrible summers where that's the last thing i wish to do.  - the only plus i can tell you is it's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin. however,"
1271	2	a	$78 for a pair of sweats seems like a lot of money, but not when you consider the amount of wear you will get out of these pants. they are thin and a little on the long side, but very flattering. plus, the thin material makes them perfect for summer nights. i love the pockets. not a big fan of the tie on the front, but that's just a personal preference. i won't just be wearing these on the weekend. i found lots of fun tops and jackets in my closet that will turn these pants into something i'll b
1272	1	a	Color, style, adjustability, easy fit, flattering!  yes on so many levels!  oh wait it's on sale!  fantastic, magnificent and pretty!  i bought medium and in 39-28-35
1273	0	a	This romper checks off all the boxes! it's beautiful and the fit is perfect!
1274	3	a	I really like this jacket! it runs big, so you may want to size down. the fabric was softer than i was expecting, but i really like it. very cute fall jacket!
1275	0	a	"Whoa! these are very high-waisted. but i think i like it! this is a very 70s style with the high waist and wide legs. the brown motif is kinda funky! i am a 70s/vintage lover though, so i was pleasantly surprised. the tall length is more than adequately long for my 6'2"" frame. i may need to take them up a little bit, in fact."
1276	4	a	Love the color, weight and styling on this sweater. it is soft and comfortable and i will wear it a lot. the only downfall is that it sheds, so it can not be worn with leggings or you will end up with fuzz everywhere.
1277	0	a	I got this before the winter. so i could wear it for summer and fall. it is light wave material for summer and fall. i think it would be good for spring time too.the color of this pants is more natural so it is easy to march any color of tops.i really enjoy it.
1278	4	a	"I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm, no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b, weigh 110 pounds, 5'3"" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!"
1279	1	a	I love the way this dress feels and falls. . if you like a form-fitting bodice this is not the dress for you, but the drape and cut is flattering and comfortable.
1280	1	a	I did not notice this dress on the website. it was not until i saw it in store (was an online purchase & returned) - i was immediately in love. i love the color, texture and rosettes. i feel like a million bucks wearing it and have received so many compliments on it. before buying it, i actually ran home to gather a previous purchase and return it so i could buy this dress and not feel guilty! i am usually a 2 or 4 and the 6 fits perfect through and through. so happy with this lovely dress!
1281	4	a	"At last, in a world of loose, billowy silhouettes, a draped top that falls a little closer to the body! the fabric is of good weight and has the right amount of stretch.  i also love the retro/vintage pattern of the fabric itself. the fit is feminine and comfortable.  you will have to wear a camisole with this top, but i do not consider that a negative. it is the way of the deep v neck."
1282	0	a	I was really lucky to pick up these shorts during the tag sale, and they are great! lightweight, roomy in the legs (way more my speed, i prefer shorts that don't cling) and really soft. they also weren't too short. i am usually between two sizes at retailer, depending on the brand, and ended up going with the smaller size. they're not really a size too big, but would've been a little too roomy/baggy in the waist, had i not purchased the smaller.
1283	4	a	"I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately, i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise, the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model, it looks like it skims the body, when in reality, it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt, but there was just too much fabric.  though the neck worked for me, i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also, it"
1284	0	a	"I'd say these are exactly as-pictured and i'm happy with them. they run a little big in the waist; i most often wear xspetite in retailer sizes, and can often wear xs regular but these are a bit loose (i have a 26"" waist, 34"" hips). the drawstring tie solves that of course but it's only in the front, it doesn't go all the way around the waist, the rest is elastic. i'd also say these are high-rise, or long in the crotch (but i'm only 5'3"" so they're probably mid-rise on tall people). i have them hi"
1285	1	a	"I ordered this in my usual retailer size, xspetite and it was too baggy in the bust. granted, i'm only a 34aa, but i would still expect it to be a little smaller in the bust at that size. the elastic waist was a little loose too (i have a 26"" waist, 34"" hips) and the inner slip showed a tiny bit like another reviewer said but it's the same fabric as the dress. the slip is adjustable but it's attached to the dress at the waist. it wasn't flattering on me in the hips either. this was a miss for me b"
1286	3	a	Love marrakech for their jackets! this piece is wonderful! i usually wear an xs or s in this brand in jackets. i went with an xs as the sleeve are a little loose. the body still fits buttoned up- nice and tailored. the stretch keeps in comfy with the tailored fit in the trunk. looks great worn open too. i think the best part is the cut and material. i am 5 '4 and 125 lbs, curvy.
1287	1	a	I'm glad i discovered this super easy to wear, flattering summer dress on a recent store visit. if i had only seen it online, i'm not sure i would have ordered it. i prefer it styled with flat sandals for an effortless boho look. i'm 5'5, slim and small chested and xs fit perfectly.
1288	3	a	I'd been looking for a replacement for my faux leather jacket and this has surpassed my expectations. well-made, lovely color, very soft, flattering cut. it runs small so i sized up from my usual petite xs to a petite s. it's warm and the lining is very pretty. hopefully it'll hold up to daily wear. i'd definitely recommend it as a great jacket to take you from fall - spring. i got the plum color.
1289	0	a	Love the material -- it is a thick cotton, but it is structured enough and thick enough so that it doesn't cling to me (in a bad way). its like wearing a sweater. my only beef with it is that the seam where the black material is stitched to the gray material creates a bump in the silhouette. (the black material is the same as the gray and it also has a herringbone pattern thats not really visible in the pictures) i would have preferred a uniform material rather than a panel sewn in. not a huge d
1290	1	a	Dress is pretty, i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer. i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings. nice but not nice enough to keep, i am returning. :(
1291	0	a	I really love the look of this jumpsuit, casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and, similar to another reviewer, proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture, but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows, and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.
1292	3	a	I wanted to fall in love with this jacket! i'm an xs or s in retailer brands so i ordered this online in both sizes. when i received it i felt the fabric and immediately loved the color and texture. creamy white (not too stark) and so incredibly soft! the length was the same as on the model which is what i wanted because being 5'2 113# many jackets swallow me. i have narrow shoulders and unfortunately this jacket was too broad and puffy for my frame, and i looked like a marshmallow. the xs was the
1293	4	a	Great long cardigan! i wear this with a simple tank
1294	0	a	"I have three pairs of these, so i must like them. the fabric is soft and comfy right from the start. i think they might run just a bit large or small depending on the color you get. i tried on a pair of pink ones in a 29 in the store. i wanted the moss color, so i had to order that and decided to order my usual size (30). they fit pretty much like the 29's in the pink. but this fabric stretches, so i'm happy with them. they're not too ""boyfriend-y"""", so not sloppy, and you could dress them up wi"
1295	4	a	The longer back makes this one of my favorite pieces for fall. the navy blue pairs well with the floral accents on the back. this blouse is a little too sheer for my liking, but nothing a cami cannot fix.
1296	1	a	This dress is the perfect combination of bohemian chic. however, the slip below the dress runs a tad bit small. i have a wide rib cage and normally wear between a 04-06. the dress would have been just perfect if the slip was a bit larger.
1297	2	a	I came to retailer just to browse and came across this dress. i almost didn't get it because it looked very big. however, i tried it on, and fell in love with it. it does run a little wide, but the length is good, and it is very comfortable. it is perfect for the summer months.
1298	3	a	"I ordered the sapphire.............it is simply beautiful! love love love. superior hunter style and quality which never disappoints!"
1299	2	a	Although not the highest quality of clothing i've ever received from retailer they are still comfy.
1300	4	a	Fit is boxy yet flattering and material is sheer but not overly delicate. took my usual size four, i am moderately short waisted.
1301	0	a	I paid full price for these gladly (the olive ones) and was delighted when i was able to purchase the black on sale. they are midweight, soft, flattering and stylish. they stretch a little (belt needed) but not much. pilcro are my go-to pants and these hit it out of the park. i wish they would come in a lighter weight version for warmer weather !
1302	4	a	I really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly can't now. i was attracted to the softness, simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it. wrinkles, pills and loses shape quickly. if you still want to get it, consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you. this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size. the styling is excellent--very versatile. but the yarn is too delicate and fussy.
1303	0	a	I love these pants! i got the blue ones. i got a petite 25 and i am 115lbs 5.1.5' - they sit low on waste and hug curves just right. they are little bit long, maybe 1 inch too long. will wear with platform or thick squared heel.
1304	0	a	Very comfy and flattering. cool on a hot day. slightly difficult to use the restroom, though.
1305	4	a	I love the bright floral print flanking the solid white middle in this top. with its swing style and large arm holes i think i could have sized down and been ok, but i usually wear a cami with my tanks so the arm holes are not an issue. also, it has a touch of spandex in it which make it extra comfy. overall, a darling top!
1306	5	a	I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it, but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children's book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it.
1307	0	a	These pants run small by two sizes or so. nice material, color true to picture.
1308	3	a	The colors on this jacket are a murky blue with a pale mauve tone for the lighter color. size is a bit on the large size. i did not feel that the jacket was that well-made and would hold up to much wear. i was looking for a jacket to dress up jeans, black pants etc and this did not fit that need. it would be a warm jacket if that is a need.
1309	4	a	It does run large. i got it on sale and it is a great sweater / coat for $200.00. i would not have paid the full price of 450.00 but i do love it. every time i wear it someone complements me.
1310	0	a	"I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably won't look good on a shorter person if it is still available when the price comes down, i might buy it."
1311	4	a	This is my favorite find of the fall. i got the mustard color and it is wonderful.   very soft, nice shape, unique design. i am usually between a medium and large in tops, but i found that the medium was a little too short for my liking.  (i am  5 ft 8 in tall).  even sizing up, it's far too short for me to wear as a dress as some others had mentioned, but looks great with jeans and boots. the large is perfect!!
1312	4	a	This is a great piece, it fits really well and the fabric is nice and soft. it is a good thickness so you don't have to wear a shirt underneath.
1313	1	a	I was looking for a dress that was short sleeved but not sleeveless. this fit my needs--not too short, nice v neck (but not deep), pretty embroidery overall i like the dress. here are a couple of downsides--i wore the dress with tights--and due to the nature of the fabric (cotton) there was no 'glide' and therefore it rode up with the tights. also, it's a bit wide int he mid section. i wanted an 'easy' and not tight/form fitting dress, but this does have almost too much fabric in the mid section
1314	1	a	The dress i received has a blue lining under the patterned chiffon, unlike the white lining that is pictured. the back of the dress is more open than it appears in the pictures so the blue lining and the large exposed zipper is a significant portion of the dress design. also, the arm holes are cut short which makes the dress feel awkward on. the quality of the dress is very high.
1315	5	a	My first complaint is, this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way), you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top, or the fabr
1316	4	a	The print is beautiful and the detail on the chest is so pretty. th fabric is a soft t-shirt martial. i ordered a medium and it fits like a large. it is supposed to be flowy and loose though. overall i feel beautiful in it. great for our hot humid charleston summers!
1317	3	a	First of all i love retailer, i am 67 yrs old and my whole closet comes from the store. this jacket is way cute. the color is very nice and the fabric is nice. only complaint is i wish the cuffs were just a bit tighter/smaller.
1318	0	a	Loved these pants when i tried them on they looked great and felt so comfortable. when i washed according to the directions on the tag the bottom of one leg lost so much color that i can't wear them anymore..so disappointed!
1319	4	a	This cardigan is very similar to the c keer wrapped asters cardigan from a few years ago....i have this cardigan and have loved wearing it; i think it only came in cream color. unfortunately, i caught the cutouts a few times, and the cutouts are slightly ripped in 2 spots...not very noticeable, but i know they're there! so i was delighted to see that retailer brought back this cardigan, this time from meadow rue. i purchased both the cream and gray colors in a size small....i am usually a s
1320	4	a	This top has really beautiful lace detail. the color is much deeper pink than the picture online. i ordered the xs petite and it fits fine but i like my tops longer so i wish i had gotten the regular xs instead. it is very pretty!
1321	4	a	The blouse is gorgeous. the detail to the blouse is outstanding and it is very feminine. from the pictures, front and back, there appears to be flow to it and room. however, my general size m was absolutely gigantic. it was like a tent. i was speechless when i looked in the mirror. i debated tapering it and then thought that's just too much effort. i'm going to return and see if i can order in 2 sizes smaller. i'm 5'1 and a 36c, if this helps.
1322	4	a	I recently bought this blouse, the soft fabric drapes nicely and the stitching is wonderful. love it!
1323	2	a	I bought these pants for my girlfriend for christmas. she really loved them! the material the pants are made of is very comfortable. the animals are super cute too.
1324	4	a	Great fit, looks excellent with jeans as well as tucked in with a pencil skirt.
1325	5	a	"This dress did not disappoint. it fits great. i'm 5'3"" and weigh 114 and i got a petite xs. length was perfect, i have a longer torso, so the waist was a bit higher than mine, but it didn't sit strangely and hung well. i am small chested, and the top fit me very well, i think if you have been blessed in that area, you may want to size up.  overall, it really is beautiful, the pattern and the unexpected transition from one pattern to the next is just what i hoped for and why i buy from retailer. i"
1326	0	a	"Just so i'm clear, the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion, but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online, it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it ""gaps"" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.  also b/c i'm 5'8, the small was just a tad too short, definitely no bending !  i'm 5'8 tall, 127lbs with an average size chest #34c# i ordered a small and the bottom"
1327	4	a	I love the desi blouse! i got it in white and it's a little more off white than pure white, but it is a great flowy top. the touch of lace across the bust is a nice accent. the only down fall is that the sleeves are a bit puffy, but the rest of the top makes up for that.
1328	1	a	This dress is soft and hits all the right spots. the neckline makes it a little alternative which i like.
1329	2	a	I like having lightweight summer pajamas, and these are perfect. the print is so much cuter in person and the fabric is wonderfully silky. the pants themselves seemed to run a little bit small. i ordered them in xs and s and ended up keeping the small. overall a great purchase.
1330	4	a	I love this top. it looks exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. i ordered the black and it is somewhat sheer. the material has a slight burnout effect. the black can be worn without a cami but if i wear it to work, i will need to add one.
1331	1	a	I fell in love with the color scheme and knew this would be perfect for vacations and weddings.  colors are slightly muted in reality, seems the retailer filter adds more contrast, but it's still gorgeous!   lining is full length, there's a zipper going up the back, fitted at the waist, and ribbon ties at the back of the neck that are long enough to style at the throat if wanted.  i wasn't sure of my size so i picked my larger range and i'm glad i did.  my weight fluctuates so when it goes down, t
1332	4	a	The sweater is cute, but scratchy.
1333	4	a	Beautiful top... the print is really unique and already received compliments on it when running my daughter in for school. it's a little fuller on the bottom and flows out so i think i may pin it but it's beautiful. definitely worth getting!
1334	0	a	"These were great pants that fit well, had good rise, perfect stretch for my curves, and i was really happy to get them on sale. (i'm 5'10"", 165lbs, with a pear shape).   after only three months of occasional wear (about once a week, at most), and following wash instructions perfectly, they started deteriorating. the pockets are becoming unsewn, the fabric has over-stretched in little sections that bunch, and the bottom hem is coming unraveled. these are the most low-quality horrible pants i've"
1335	1	a	Really cute dress and i cannot wait to wear it for my wedding rehearsal dinner. the buttons on the back are my favorite part about the dress since they add something different. it fits tts, but it is more fitted than a regular shift dress, which is nice. i am 5'9, 145 pounds, and the size 6 fit me perfectly.
1336	4	a	"Loved everything about this top except two things: the price (there is a lot of pretty detail though) and the shoulders. what is not depicted in the stock photos is how wide the shoulder ruffles are...i have an athletic build at 5'7"", 140 lbs and 32dd and this top unfortunately made me look like a football player. i ordered a small and the fit was perfect. beware that this top is on the shorter side. it really is very pretty but i would steer away if you have athletic or broad shoulders."
1337	4	a	This vest is well made and a very flattering cropped silhouette. i typically wear a 0p and ordered an xxs--it fits perfectly. it looks awesome with the shirt pictured underneath.
1338	0	a	I tried these on at the store and thought the color, texture and style was very nice, but i needed the petite length. so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite! darn. the regular length hits me just above the ankle, so i suppose it is still do-able, but i hate to pay full price for something that doesn't fit quite right. maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it.
1339	1	a	This dress is so beautiful in person. it is not overly flowy, well made and extremely feminine. i really have not a bad word to say about it. and on sale, it's a steal. i plan to wear mine with tall boots as shown and with my cowboy boots.
1340	4	a	The blue has three colors of stripes: blue, white and black 9between white and blue). the black stripe made it too busy for me. the material is soft and clingy. i followed the advice of previous reviewer and sized up to a m (normally wear s). the shirt fit as pictured on the model, not tight but form fitting.
1341	0	a	Unlike other reviewers, i found these pants to run true to size (in my case, my usual 6) or even a tad roomy. the red pattern is just festive enough for informal holiday parties. i appreciate the belt loops!
1342	4	a	This top is really beautiful. the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch. and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a m/l and it was just too big. i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if i'd been able to snag a smaller size. but the m/l looked like a teal sack, so it's going back.
1343	2	a	This is a great fit and super cute, price not bad either!!
1344	1	a	"This dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice. it does have an a-line fit in the skirt. the stitching is beautiful. honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me. some may like that, but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted. the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress. the fabric is cotton and it is not lined. i am 5'9"" and it does hit right about where it does on the model. i am sending it back, because i didn't say ""wow, i love this"" w"
1345	1	a	I saw this online, and liked it but then tried it on in a store a few weeks later, and the pictures truly do not do this gem of a dress justice. the fit is flowy but tts as the cotton lining underneath fits closer to the body. it's an incredibly comfortable and easy piece to wear. the first day i wore this i received so many compliments! the colors are vibrant and it's really just a unique piece with beautiful detailing from the embroidery on the top of the dress to the beads on the ties on the
1346	1	a	This dress is casual enough to throw on as a cover up and dressy enough for a night out. it so comfy and versatile. will never go out of style. it does run large, but that is just the style of the dress. it really is the perfect summer dress.
1347	1	a	After missing out on last year's similar dress, i am so glad i finally purchased this one! it is beautiful in person. i bought to wear to a wedding, but i am curious if others think it might be too white? i bought the peach color. i will keep this dress no matter what. hope they come out with more next season!
1348	4	a	This sweater is super cute. it has nice weight to it and is just a nice casual but attractive piece to wear with jeans or white pants. love that it zips and just a really cute pattern of marigold, mint/teal and grey/dark gray.
1349	1	a	I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful, both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees, not like shown in the picture here. on that note, i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.
1350	0	a	"These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter, but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight, but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back!   for reference ( if you decide to try your luck), i am 5'7"", 128# and my normal size s was perfect."
1351	4	a	Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don't know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain, not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn't even the same material as the front. it's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand, this was just a quality control oversight i guess.
1352	4	a	This top is really cute- the plum is a lovely color and the top fits true to size. love the back detailing. and it is really good t-shirt quality.
1353	1	a	Beautiful dress but i had to returned because the size large was a little big
1354	4	a	This top is so much better in person. i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy. it is not and i have sensitive skin. i love this top and have got lots of compliments.
1355	0	a	Love these. wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots. nice subtle print. i think they run about 1 size small. i'm normally a size 0/25. the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled. size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough. incidentally, i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too. love love
1356	4	a	The shirt is mostly a thick sweatshirt material and is very short when trying on - undershirt required to make up for length and the see through mesh in the pattern.  felt about 1 size too small as well
1357	4	a	Very flattering on. fitted on top with a loose swingy bottom. like most retailer tops it does run a little big. i would size down if between sizes. the material does seem a little fragile so i'm not sure how it will hold up. i like the look/fit enough that i may get a 2nd color.
1358	4	a	This vest is the best!! even though it has no sleeves it truly keeps you warm. it feels like you're wearing a soft blanket around you. it is my favorite!
1359	4	a	A great sweater to throw over just about anything. i love it, but the only reason i couldn't give it 5 stars is because you must be very carful with it, as it can snag on anything. the fabric is similar to intertwined ribbons. the first time i put it on i got a snag right away, but it was easily pulled trough to the inside. now i am just super cautious. i do love it though. very comfortable and super casual. not heavy at all, but just enough to be happy to have to throw on when the cool spring/s
1360	0	a	They are very comfortable and have kept their shape after a couple of wearings. the pants can be used for informal or on the dressier side. the spandex in them is contributes to the comfort.
1361	4	a	I love this t-shirt, i wish it came in tons of other prints! very soft, almost feels lived in, and high quality all the same.
1362	1	a	This dress was my absolute favorite recent retailer purchase. the fit is so flattering. i think this dress runs true to size-i usually wear a size 6 in hd in paris, and that's what size i ordered. i expect i could have fit in a 4 but the 6 is comfortable. i am 5'4'' but i ordered the regular length and it hit just above the knee. i agree that it could use pockets but no need for lining. however-- i just laundered this dress for the first time-hand wash, lay flat to dry (as recommended) and this dr
1363	3	a	Love this piece. can be worn casual or fancy. runs slightly big, but that seems to be the style. size down if you are in between sizes. the color is unique and organic. really comfortable and fun fabric.
1364	2	a	This is a lovely little nightie. i am a size 8 and i bought the medium and it fits perfect. it's soft and lightweight and not as see thru as i thought it would be. very light and airy and the sale price was great!!!
1365	4	a	Wore this poncho and received 5 compliments before the school day even began! love the pockets and hood. bought three at the sale price - one for me, a friend, and my niece - different ages and sizes but everyone of us love this poncho.
1366	4	a	I'm happy i bought this top. it's very cute and almost a little immature/childish, but with the right bottoms it looks classy. i found it to run large so i sized down one size and it fits good, though the straps can feel a little tight if it rides up. it washes beautifully. will probably not work on large chested women.
1367	4	a	Love this top! it is almost universally flattering, and washes beautifully. it is as easy as throwing on a sweatshirt with leggings, but soooo much better! if you are on the fence on this one, i highly recommend you give it a try.
1368	0	a	These shorts work well for shopping, running errands, or spending hours on dirty baseball bleachers. they are not too short and are true to size.
1369	1	a	If you have an hourglass figure this dress accentuates your curves. i do need to wear a tank underneath as dress is low cut.
1370	4	a	I eyed this for so long hoping it would go on sale. i finally bought it during the 20% off retailer members day. sized up from my usual size 4 to avoid the buttons on the bust looking like they were about to burst free. the rest still fits way. i absolutely cannot wait for the next rainy day to wear this!
1371	0	a	This jumpsuit is so so comfy i can't wait to wear it! def runs on the large size.
1372	4	a	I purchased this top in the taupe color, and it is much prettier in person than it photographs online. it runs about a half size too large, and sits slightly off the shoulders. fun casual top for the fall.
1373	0	a	I loved these shorts; however, they seemed to be doomed! i received these on july 2nd & wore them at for a party we had on july 3rd, with the top shown. the fit was true to size, style & quality were nice. during the day i first ripped them on a low arbor gate latch, then later they were splashed with red wine when my husband startled me & i threw my red wine in the air. typically, i am very careful and do no have an issue with ruining my clothes. he felt so bad he asked me to get a new pair. i
1374	4	a	I really love this top, great colors, comfortable, long enough (always a problem for me), light but feels quality fabric and nice details.
1375	0	a	"I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it! the fabric is a great weight- flowy, but still substantial enough. with nude undergarments, i can't see anything. in fact, that is one of the things i love; no special undergarments are required, so it is very comfortable and still very flattering. i typically wear a medium- 135 pounds, 5'4"", 34b, 28 waist, 40 hip. i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big. i would have bought it, but the salesperson suggested i try"
1376	1	a	The perfect dress for dinner date or summer weddings. or traveling. love this dress. not sure on washing yet since it is a silk dress. extremely comfortably and beautiful. i can't recall the last time i bought a new dress.
1377	4	a	The shirt is beautifully made and very comfortable. i'm a medium though, and i ordered as such- but it's way too big for me.
1378	0	a	Absolutely love these pants! i have had these pilcos for about two months now and it has been a staple in my fall wardrobe. i have worn them at least once a week. the only downfall is the button has already fallen off and the seam in the knee has recently torn apart. given the leather, i'm not sure if they can be fixed. these are fabulous, but the quality is just not there. very disappointing.
1379	0	a	This jumpsuit is very comfortable. the material is soft the waist is elasticised, it is not drawstring as it seems in the photos.
1380	5	a	This lovely skirt absolutely hits the mark for quality. it is a substantial weight for fall, a deep vivid blue color, and just the right length to wear with boots.  it was a trifle snug in the waist. i would have kept it anyway, but the oversized pockets stuck out on either side in an awkward way.  at this price, it just wasn't right for me.
1381	0	a	"I love hess overalls. they are true to size and have a great vintage look to them but done in a classic way. i am 5'6"" 125lbs and a 34b. i bought the xs and it fit great! they are fitted and not sloppy like a lot of overalls. you can easily dress them up or down. soft and stretchy material is a plus"
1382	4	a	Received this shirt yesterday and loved it. doesn't look that great online in pics, but it is a unique and beautiful top. the material is a substantial woven cotton so it lays nicely and keeps its shape . i am 5'5 and 128lbs and a small bust size 34a , i usually wear small in shirts but since it is a longer length i didn't want it to tight around my butt.... i am curvy in that area size 6 pants....i ordered the medium and i am so glad i did .. it lifts just like on the model...the only downfall
1383	4	a	Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.
1384	4	a	I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.
1385	2	a	I tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer.
1386	0	a	"Love these pants! thank you retailer for making ""tall"" really tall! i am 6 feet and have to wear heals keep the pants from dragging- love it! i got the black- not 'shear.' they run just a tad small. i am a 4/6 in pants and the 6t just fit me.  i wear with a tank for casual, beach look; colorful silk top for a dressier look- very versatile.   i just may have to buy this in the green. (i would get the white, but some reviews say they are pretty shear."
1387	1	a	This dress' style and color is very flattering. i think i will wear it in the spring and fall as well as the winter.the m fits me and i'm 5'8' and 140 pounds.
1388	4	a	This is such a lovely top. it is a bit sheer but i wear a cami under it. i wish it came in more colors because it is just so pretty!
1389	4	a	I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i'm concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked!
1390	5	a	"This dress is just my style. i have been waiting for it to go on sale since it hit new arrivals. when the sale hit the extra 30% off, i pulled the trigger. unfortunately for me, it was a little snug in the bust and as a tall lady, the waist hit me at slightly the wrong spot. i am 5' 9"" and am a 36d. so if you are tall and busty, this will not be the dress for you just from the way it is cut and manufactured. the skirt section of the dress has a hook underneath the vest section that it is pretty"
1391	4	a	This top is super versatile--i wear it with jeans on the weekend but it's also work appropriate. it's light and perfect for warm weather!
1392	4	a	The color and fabric are really soft and lovely. it runs big so you can get away with a size smaller of even 2 sizes smaller. it would look great paired with leggings and boots and a long sweater coat or with skinny jeans and sandals. this is going to be my new favorite.
1393	4	a	Love this! it's loose and easy for summer, fabric is not too sheer. the asymmetrical ruffle is such a cute feature. washes well. i got the pink for myself (though it's a deep coral color - perfect for me) and the gray for my daughter. wish they'd had the powder blue when i bought ours; i'd have bought that color for her instead.
1394	4	a	I was excited to try this on in the store today. the zipper details on the shoulder are really cute and the ribbing pattern is flattering. i was disappointed when i put it on though because it fits like a baby-doll / pregnancy top. it's snug around the bust, and then flares out pretty widely through the lower half. you can't really see that on the model. i was hoping it was more of a fitted tee, but sadly, that wasn't the case.
1395	3	a	I typically wear either a 2 or 4 and had to size up with this coat. the 6 fit, but i decided to go with an 8 to ensure it'd fit with layers. the sleeves aren't lined, so it's a little itchy against bare arms. it's really flattering and i love the pattern!
1396	4	a	This sweater is much prettier in person than in the picture. the colors are soft and feminine. medium fit me perfectly. this is the soft, cuddly sweater i have been looking for.
1397	1	a	This arrived today and i am thrilled with it. the material is soft but not at all clingy. it drapes perfectly, falling just above the knee. there is a matching slip that is as nicely made as the dress itself. what a find!
1398	3	a	I found this in your store and had to have it! i wore it on a date night and received more compliments than i can count!!!! the attention to detail makes this jacket special. i am 5 ft 5 inches 124lbs and a 4fits but a 6 is perfect for a sweater underneath. i actually went back a bought the other color. worth every penny.
1399	4	a	"This blouse is beautiful and true to size. i was so happy it fit after ordering it online. i'm a bit busty and broad but generally wear a m in most retailer tops and the m fit perfectly. length was perfect on me...not too long and not short. i'm 5'1"" for reference. definitely a top that can be worn dressed up with slacks and heels or skinny jeans and flats. love it!"
1400	4	a	I bought this because i loved it online but in person there is another level to the shirt that i did notice in another picture. i didn't like the second level on me since i am a shorter person. just didn't fit my body quite right.
1401	4	a	I was hesitant to get this piece but for the price i couldn't resist and i'm so glad i got it !! it is beautiful in person and can be worn so many  different ways.  it really makes you look slim too ! i got the size small and i am 5'4 and 130 lbs and it's a perfect fit !!
1402	2	a	I love this as a lounge-at-home top. the colors and pattern are really pretty, it's soft and warm. very comfy and cozy. but it's also boxy and thick so not a flattering cut.
1403	4	a	I just got this in the mail today. it's really cute when i put it on, but it's definitely meant to be worn slightly off the shoulders like the model is showing. i was hoping i could wear it both ways, but then the v-neck becomes way too low. i would recommend sizing down unless you're bigger busted. however, the torso is cut very true to size which might make it hard for some to size down without it becoming too small. a larger bust might help to keep this from falling off the shoulders. i'm not
1404	4	a	I love this tee!!! i bought the red, and it is just so cute. the background is a light pink - and there are accents of deeper rose and mint green. i also bought the angel of the north cascade cardigan in rose, which looks great over this tee. buy it!
1405	4	a	I definitely recommend this shirt. it's lights and airy, something you can wear everyday.
1406	4	a	This has a very nice hang to it- combination of the cut and linen- like fabric. i liked it so much that i bought two different colors. so many tees are blousy and full now;i am short so they look like maternity tops. this one is much more flattering.
1407	0	a	This is beautiful fabric and a good fit, but it's such a pain to get on and off, that i just don't want to hassle with it. the button is in the back, and very tricky to reach. too bad, because otherwise it's darling!
1408	4	a	As far as t-shirts go, this one is fun, i love the lace up detail in the back. the xs regular fit nicely (115 lbs, 30dd), the shirt flares out (swing), so it can be a little much on the smaller gals, but it was ok enough on me that the stylist decided to try it on too. the orange color was pretty, but i decided to pass as i have a lot of orange tops... and that is the color that was most flattering on my skin. amterial is on the thinner side and a little tiny sheer, must be the trend...
1409	0	a	"These pants have a really cute design. however, they are a bit short (and i'm only 5'4""). i'm still happy i purchased them, but i thought i was purchasing full length pants (as shown on the model) and not capris."
1410	0	a	"I purchased for my daughter who is mid 30's and she loved the romper. i'm going to list her size since that is appropriate for who is wearing the item."
1411	0	a	Tried it on a whim and could not leave it behind. 5/4', 135, size 4-6, took a 6. something about the pocket placement, fabric weight, cut, and color make this one a real winner for me. plan to wear it with a creme windowpane coat.
1412	1	a	"Received this dress yesterday, love it! my initial hesitation in ordering this dress, even though it is my fav color....was rather bright for sept.. but loved it and decided to order and wear it next spring. delighted to open the package and see that the dress is much darker than in the pics...more of a jade green. it is still a summer fabric/style, however the darker color will be perfect for the warmer fall days ahead. this dress is beautifully made, superior workmanship, and the fabric i"
1413	4	a	Quirky tunic length top. has a windowpane print on the inside and the grey plaid looks like flannel but is cotton. the red burgandy embroidery adds punch and it has a boho flair. size down one size runs big.
1414	3	a	"I love the design and color of this jacket. when i saw it pictured, i thought it was a vest. the sleeves and collar are made of a contrasting type of fabric; the sleeves are a knit but fit in very well with the design of the jacket. i ordered a small because i had ordered a small in a vest made by the same manufacturer.  this jacket runs smaller, the sleeves were very tight , and overall it was just too small. had to return it."
1415	4	a	I read the mixed reviews on this tee but i think the fit is flattering and comfortable. i sized down as i do in many retailer tops and it is fitted in the shoulder and chest and then widens away at the waist. the length hits me at the hip--i have worn it layered with a longer tank underneath.
1416	1	a	I really wanted to love this dress, but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless, but it didn't work for this short,
1417	1	a	"This dress is super soft and really flattering. i'm 5'2"" and i tried a regular size m in the store and hated it on me, but decided to order a petite m and give it a try and i love it. it's one i've been wearing a lot with ankle boots and all sorts of jackets. it's great for these fall days that are still warm-ish. would be really cute with tights."
1418	4	a	I don't normally try on tops like this but i liked the product shot so much that i wanted to repeat the outfit. i grabbed a large because it wasa shorter blouse. it was huge. i sized down to the medium and it was still loose but if i were to purchase, it would be that size. the red against the blue was very pretty but i didn't know if felt like a little kid in a uniform. the back did not lie flat, not sure if it was because of my 36d chest or because of the shirt design. it is well made and i th
1419	4	a	I have a number of sweaters from moth, and they never disappoint. the ones made with this ultra soft and warm yarn are my favorite. i bought both colors :) i wear it with jeans or dressier clothes-- i'd say it's very versatile.
1420	0	a	This skirt was placed next to the gallery skirt (corduroy skirt) and i thought it was the same until i touched the fabric and realized it was denim. the material is not the average stiff jean type but much thinner cotton material. i am surprised that this skirt is now released because i feel that it should have belonged to the summer collection. i think it is a nice basic casual skirt if you need one. kudos for the unique buttons, the first button is decorative which stands out from the rest of
1421	4	a	I am usually a medium/large and was pleased to fit in the small/medium that i ordered after reading some of the reviews. lovely piece, great to wear over a short sleeve t-shirt, 3/4 of a sleeve shirt or even a long sleeve shirt when weather permits here in florida. very happy i ordered this!!
1422	4	a	Perfect way to add warmth in transition weather
1423	4	a	I loved the color of this shirt but it does run big. i even sized down and it was still large on me and the ruffles flare out a bit which was not flattering one me. it looks pretty on the hangar.
1424	4	a	Hi, this top is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. very feminine. it has a small amount of swing without a large amount of fabric. love it.
1425	1	a	Thin for this late in the season, but the colors are so pretty. i'm going to layer it over a long sleeve t, top with a cardi and pair with leggings. runs large. love the the unconnected slip. 5 stars.
1426	4	a	This shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line. the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft. the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it. no spare buttons included, but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it. not big enough of an issue to return,
1427	1	a	I had mixed feelings about this dress. the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd. it has two slips, one that fits close and a second that's a bit too puffy. so the skirt didn't sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger. the odd length made it unflattering. it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i didn't want to risk it.
1428	4	a	Love sundry. great quality. if you want a looser more comfy fit size up!
1429	0	a	I love the cut of these pants! kind of a flare, kind of a boot cut and super flattering. they are long so really need heels to keep a nice leg. they have tons of stretch so i could wear two different size. i choose the smaller for a little less length in the leg. i consider them more pants then denim.
1430	4	a	"I purchased this in white my normal size being a 2, a size 4 fit better on me. i love the crisp white top with jeans and sandals, so much that i just ordered the same top in the raspberry color.   would definitely recommend."
1431	0	a	Really cute romper that can be dressed up or down. super comfortable and flattering. i ordered the xs and it fit perfect.
1432	2	a	I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool, soft, not itchy, light weight, lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th
1433	0	a	"I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact, two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however, as we were looking at the items, we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality, as the previous reviewer noted. therefore, none of us purchased the pants.  the staff at the store were very helpful"
1434	1	a	"I ordered a size xl in the mango. the fit on me matches the model for the most part so i think it's true-to-size. it looks like it's intended to have a loose, flowier fit throughout the dress. the only confusing part to me is the model is listed as being 5' 9"" and i'm under 5' 6"" yet the length is the same. it fits me at knee-length too. i thought it would hit a little longer based on the model's info for the photos and getting the regular sizing. the one thing i wish was different is to have it"
1435	1	a	I really wanted to like this dress. the material, design, length and fit all over was perfect, except for the armholes- too big and the ruffles came right upto the nipple line. not comfortable with that. sadly, had to return.
1436	3	a	"I initially bought the red and blue sweater in a medium. i usually wear a large and the medium fits perfectly and is still a bit baggy. i'm tall (5'9"") and so i love the length of the sleeves when they are unrolled. it's a very versatile piece. with sleeves rolled down you can fold the collar so the red is out of sight and just have a navy blue sweater. either look is nice. i loved it so much i bought the black and brown version. also, the fabric doesn't feel thick but it is very insulating and"
1437	4	a	"I am 5' 7"" with an athletic build (small chest, small waist, muscular hips/thighs). this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am. i purchased a small, an extra small would be way too short. i could see how it works for fuller figured girls."
1438	0	a	So glad i was able to snag these killer 70's-ish flares. they are super cool at a nice length. love the button detail. i ordered these in my current size and they fit right out of the box. love them so much.
1439	1	a	I was nervous about this purchase, but it turned out to be a new favorite. the blue color is stunning on and i can easily see this taking me from work to dinner. i am normally a size 2 or 4 in dresses. after reading reviews about how this dress runs large, i ordered a 2 and hoped i didn't have to return it. the 2 is perfect and roomy. the drawstring can be let out or in for more figure definition. this really is a beautiful and modest dress.
1440	5	a	Swing dresses are the holy grail of comfort. whatever's going on underneath doesn't matter because you're all arms and legs and billowy fun and this dress doesn't disappoint. beautiful, light and silky fabric with a pattern and color palate that can easily work all spring, summer and into the fall with some layers. a great, unique dress!
1441	4	a	Love the detailing around the neck of this top looks great under cardigan or by itself. i sized down to an xs. seems to be of good quality although to lengthen its life i don't plan on putting it in the dryer :)
1442	4	a	I ordered this sweater and it is beautiful.... i am returning though because it fits snug through chest, shoulders and upper arms. i am an xs - and that is what i ordered and it was tight through these areas. if you are busty it would be a definite problem.
1443	1	a	This is my new favorite dress! it's super soft, comfortable, and flattering! i have worn it twice and each time have received multiple compliments. i love, love, love it!
1444	0	a	These pants are amazing. they are so comfortable and fit true to size. i typically wear a 28 or 29 depending on the pants and the 28s fit me perfectly. i bought the olive green pair and they are everything i have ever wanted in a pair of olive pants. i love that they are tighter in the butt area and loose in the knees and calves so they are not restrictive. i want every color!
1445	4	a	I was on the fence about this top, because i don't typically do longer tunic styles. however, it really is quite lovely. i paired it with long jeans, wedge sandals, and a delicate necklace - so pretty! it fits very nicely and i was surprised at how much i liked the length.
1446	1	a	I ordered the black and white version online, and the dress fit perfectly. it was very well-made with a nicely textured, heavier cloth, and the overall appearance is very classy. it is a versatile dress, and i would highly recommend it!
1447	2	a	I absolutely adore this top!!! i got it in the blue and went back a few days later and got the gray as well. it's super soft and casual but still really cute. it's a little long (i'm 5'4) but i tuck in the front or tie a knot on the side and it looks good. i wish they had more colors so i could have a few more of these!
1448	4	a	The pattern attracted me to this top in store and when i tried it on, i was pleasantly surprised it has a slight swing shape to it which i love. i'm a 36c/d and normally wear an 8 or 10 and bought this in a large. the front buttons don't peek open and actually lays flat which is unusual for me with button up tops. i'm actually wearing it today with some printed green shorts. the stripes on this top make it easy to mix patterns, too :)
1449	4	a	So, i want to start off by saying, the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern, unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom, it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have
1450	4	a	I originally purchased this sweater in a size small (5'4 125lbs) and i was swimming in it! i went into the store and exchanged it for a size xs and it still runs a little big. i do love the quality though and its so soft! it's made of a sweatshirt like material which gives it a lazy sunday feel. it is definitely more casual than your typical cardigan but is so cozy! this is quickly becoming a go to for after yoga or just lazy sundays at home. great product!
1451	4	a	Since there isn't one where i live, i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up. saw this and bought it off the rack w/out trying on. had to get a m as they were out of s, and yes, it's a tad large on me, but still glad i got it. i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas. love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee. the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch.
1452	4	a	I love this black turtleneck. arms are a little long, so should have gotten small. i wore it and love it! you can play with collar and snaps; up or down.
1453	1	a	I really love the feel of the fabric on this dress. when you first take it from the package it resembles a tent, but once you figure out how to scrunch the front and back around the straps, it resembles the photo. the fabric is very soft and the indigo colors are amazing. this dress is perfect over a swimsuit or for casual gatherings. you can even dress it up with a belt. it is somewhat sheer, but does look cute with a cropped jacked over it.
1454	2	a	This is s very comfortable cami with comfortable and nicely designed straps in back.
1455	2	a	My new favorite socks! has a grip and doesn't slip off like some of my other liner socks have because this one covers more of your feet. perfect for my low boots.
1456	4	a	This top is beautiful.  at the present price, grab it.  the fit was tts for me, a bit loose if anything.  the blue green color, which is not pictured, is shown in my uploaded photos.
1457	4	a	"Color, fabric blend, and pattern are even more beautiful in person! unfortunately, i wont be keeping this due to length. i am only 5'3"" and this top dropped only to about 2 inches below my navel. if you have a short torso, or like the short look, i would recommend this!"
1458	1	a	"This dress is beautiful, and the a line shape is very flattering. i'm 5'10"" and it hits just above my knees. i'm small on top, so the keyhole slit isn't an issue for me, but it does gap more than it does on the model. this dress has lots of versatility.  like another reviewer said, you can dress it up with heels, or dress it down with boots."
1459	0	a	"I love a jumpsuit for its ease of dressing. this is the 3rd i've purchased from retailer. material is thin and gauzy as described. with a sweater or jacket it will be plenty warm for so cal winters and great the rest of the year. if you are all tall, the waist might fall a bit short. i am 5'6"" and the waist just barely hits my waistline. doubt i would have purchased this item full price, but on sale it's a great deal."
1460	4	a	"It was a little on the thinner side (fabric), a little more sheer that i would have liked. i actually prefer that it doesn't have the straps in the back, i didn't order it before until i read the reviews. fit loosely. the shirt is comfortable, and the back is beautiful (love bows), tbu the front was just ordinary. for the price, even on sale, i didn't feel i absolutely needed it, but if you are looking for a hite tank, it is pretty cute. (ivory, not pure white).  xs: 115 lbs, 60 dd."
1461	4	a	"This fits tts.  it is body-hugging as shown on the model.  the knit is thin, soft with tons of stretch.  i bought the ""navy"" which is the color shown in the photo.  as you can see, it's not really navy.  it's a strange blue that's more like a faded dark mallard blue.  but, it's still blue.  the sleeves are long on me. so you taller girls won't have issues.  the ruffles move and are so fun.  the fabric, however, is not finished off.  it's raw cut material, which is why i gave it 4 stars."
1462	2	a	Like other reviewers, i did find that this jacket runs big. i am usually a size 2p or an xs and found an xxs in store and fits well. it'll be a great everyday-jacket!
1463	5	a	I was on the fence about ordering this jacket, but i'm so glad i did. i got my birthday discount to help afford it. as the first reviewer said, the weight is substantial, but not too heavy, and the embroidery is beautiful! i have not worn this jacket yet, but i expect to get many compliments when i do! i usually don't wear jackets in this style, so it's a fresh, new approach for me....the embroidery takes it to the next level! it fits true to size. i usually take a medium, and the medium fits pe
1464	4	a	I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large, as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also, the layering looks nothing like it does on the model, it looks sloppy, unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist, otherwise it just doesn't wor
1465	1	a	I waited patiently for this dress to arrive in my local retailer store and loved the design immediately (the green motif). as others noted, it is on the flowly side. for this reason, i went with a size s. i wore it on easter and can't wait to wear it again. i did not have any issues with wrinkling or putting on the dress. it is a simple over the head, no fuss kind of dress. you get to be supremely comfortable and look like a goddess. this is one of those retailer pieces that you will have for years
1466	1	a	I wanted to love this dress..and it did not disappoint! true to size, not too snug but doesn't make you look shapeless. the material is soft and has great movement. looks great with boots and booties. i know i will be wearing this one often!
1467	1	a	I was not expecting to like this. i tried it on in the store on a whim. it happened to drape beautifully. this will be a great work dress for the summer with something underneath the bring up the neckline. the blue color is soft and pretty.
1468	2	a	"My new favorite cozy and stylish ""go-to"" piece for everything from park with the kiddos to mat class to impromptu financial meetings."
1469	4	a	I'm a power-walker. i bought this tank in 3 colors and rotate through them. they're great for working out with a nice sports bra underneath. i also wear them with leggings. so cute! love the colors, the fit. yes, they're thin. i don't think they'll last for years and years, but with the sale price they are such a great deal.
1470	1	a	On the hanger, this dress looks a bit boxy, however once on, it has a beautiful flow and elegance to it. it's super feminine and cinches in at the waist perfectly. my one (major) complaint that prevented me from purchasing the dress? there's no give to the dress. i wasn't able to lift my arms up past 90 degrees and that's sort of a problem. it's a shame though because the outside shell is gorgeous and so structured, and it would have been a nice contrast to the shape of the dress on a body.
1471	1	a	This is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesn't look anything like that in reality. it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over. i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive.
1472	1	a	"Loved the dress on-line. ordered a petite small. fits perfectly. i am barely 5'5"" and carry my weight in hips and thighs. this fits perfectly without being too snug on the butt!! so, if you are a pear shape, get this dress!!"
1473	4	a	This is a gorgeous top; however, it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?
1474	1	a	"Runs true to size for brand/retailer clothes (xs for 5'5"", ~120lbs), but a little tight in the shoulders/biceps if you have fairly developed muscles or just wide shoulders. watch out for the skirt riding up when you reach for something or bend over."
1475	1	a	Ordered this dress in an xs, that is the size i usually wear. this runs small, but not only that it is the way it is cut, very small through the hips, thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model, but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!
1476	4	a	"I ordered the ""london, paris, milan"" print red top in a size 4. i go back and forth with ordering 2's and 4's but i figured that with long sleeves, i'd rather have a little room than it be fitted. my boyfriend asked if i bought it for valentine's day- the red print and the cities struck him as romantic. anyway, lovely top. lightweight material will be nice for layering during winter, and wearing on it's own in spring and next fall."
1477	4	a	I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this shirt. it's comfortable, the fit is excellent and flattering, and it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. i bought it in the brown and the black and have no regrets.
1478	2	a	The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however, the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :(
1479	4	a	"I was unsure about this top at first because of reviews saying ""maternity""and this shirt can have that feel if you look at it from that point. i tried it again and the arm holes fit perfectly. it has a swing cut and a peplum style which brings lots of fabric and swing. it's not that it runs big it's supposed to swing/flow from body like many styles but the peplum adds bulk because it's a little thicker fabric. so i can see how some may think maternity because of all the fabric and cut, but i lov"
1480	0	a	I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice,  but if it sits at my natural waist,  the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad,  i love the print and ease of this design.
1481	3	a	This is a beautiful piece that can be paired with multiple ways.. the color is rich and classy
1482	1	a	The dress was great! the zipper was just a little tough but over all a very classic, feminine piece.
1483	2	a	These t-shirts by pure + good are buttery soft and so flattering. they are just loose enough to drape beautifully and the detailing at the neckline takes them just a step above basic tee. i have 2 from last year, machine washed many many times (on delicate cycle) and they still look almost new. i was hoping to pick up a couple more but they're gone! please retailer, bring these tees back!! i would kill for that beautiful dark blue...
1484	4	a	"I really like this top. bought it in ""purple"" but i would not call it that. it is more maroon or burgundy. color is exactly what it shows in the online photo. really like the green also. crocheted arms are super. i found it ran slightly small, so if you are between sizes, order up. one slight personal problem for me is that there is cashmere in it and i live in florida. even though we do get cooler weather here, i am not sure i will have that much chance to wear it; it will be too warm for me. t"
1485	0	a	"I am 5'0"", 109lbs, and the 00 petite fit perfectly. the length was great too. as one reader noted, the zipper can be a little tricky  but dont let that deter you from getting a pair of these sweet duds. it stretchs out a little as the day goes by but that is bearable.  it has a hint of pink to it too. can be dressed up for the office or dressed down."
1486	0	a	Okay, i am not that tall and don't have legs for miles, but i loving wearing a wide-legged cropped pant with heels for a change from the everyday. these pants are great because they are 99% cotton. the cotton is a nice weight (not too light) and the barely there fringe bottom is a nice detail. i usually wear a 28 in pilcro and that's what i bought! i would describe the color as leaning more toward khaki than green, though it did look little green under the lights in the store.
1487	1	a	Buy it. buy it right now! this dress is gorgeous, and would be on anyone. i don't care what size you are, it's so pretty, that you feel pretty in it! i loved wearing it, and since i am in florida, i can wear it all year long. so it's worth it. happy, very happy, with this purchase!
1488	5	a	"This dress is so light and twirly and the fabric is as airy as it is pretty. sadly the fit was a bit off. i am 5'7"", 128. i tried on my usual sz 2 and found the top to be saggy at the armpits but too tight at the waist seam; going up to a 4 only made for a saggier top. most likely a great dress for lean or long-torsoed ladies, which sadly i'm not!"
1489	1	a	"Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist, creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress.  why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo."
1490	4	a	Ordered this online and thought it was more of a red than the true orange that it is
1491	1	a	"I'm 60+, in relatively decent shape, 135 lbs, and size 6 is perfect. i went for the regular rather than petite sizing, which came well below my knees, and although i would usually have a sheath dress like this hemmed up to that slim part right at the bottom of the knee, the slim silhouette shape served to lengthen the profile as a longer dress, so i left it about 3"" below the knee. the stretch allows it to hug the body, and with the right undergarments, it is super comfortable and attractive. go"
1492	0	a	This skirt is lovely and fits perfectly. the print on the front provides a great contrast to the back of the skirt and stands out. the material is thick enough to take you from fall to winter easily. and the fabric is structured enough to highlight all the right curves. a great purchase.
1493	0	a	These pants are so comfy i'm getting a second pair. i ordered the olive color in a small/reg, im thinking of ordering the xs next time since they do stretch out a great deal as the day goes on. would definitely recommend these for sure. hope this review is helpful as i struggled with ordering petite or not. glad i didn't!
1494	1	a	I bought this unique beauty in a size 0. the fit was superb and without compromise. the ascetics are incomparable, as well as the quality. the most stunning dress i have purchased from retailer in quite a while!
1495	1	a	Very comfortable dress and cool for our hot summers. i ordered in my normal size medium. neckline is cut a little low, but not enough to change my mind on the purchase.
1496	0	a	This is a really cute skirt, and it seems well-made (good stitch-work and enough weight to the fabric that i'm not worried about underwear show-through but not too heavy for a summer skirt). i sized up from an 8 to a 10 because it was difficult to get the skirt over my bum. also, the zipper doesn't lay flat when i have it in the back of the skirt so i just shifted it to the side--still looks great imo. i think if you have hips or a booty you might want to size up on this skirt. color is true to
1497	4	a	I purchased this tee last week in white and love it! as soon as i saw that it was on sale i ran to get a price adjustment and to pick up a few more colors! i had every intention to grab up the blue today however i tried on four larges and all were cut way shorter than the other colors. i ended up purchasing the red which fits exactly as my white one does. perfect light weight, easy, but adorable tee for summer!
1498	4	a	"I love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended. not so. for starters the top is much more of a beige in person. a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully. secondly there is just so. much. fabric. it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like i've tried to hard to make it ""work"", lastly the"
1499	0	a	"I picked this up this weekend. so gorgeous! i usually don't do maxi length. at 5'3"" it can be overwhelming. but this is so flattering! this is floor length on me. i picked up a couple tops at another store because the suggested sweaters were just too baggy for my frame. i'll pair it with a cream blouse (pictured) to dress up and a pink crepe blouse and denim jacket for a more casual look. i'm usually a 4 and the small fits perfectly."
1500	1	a	I wasn't expecting to love to this dress as much as i do.  the length and horizontal stripes (petite was sold out and my torso is square) are automatically two strikes but the sale-on-sale price was begging me to give it a go.  so glad i did!  the cut and flare are flattering.  the self to tie is slimming and can be styled different ways.  the regular length is doable when i wear platform wedges.  the colors scream summer and vacation fun.  my only problem is the feel of the fabric--liner is fin
1501	1	a	This dress is everything i love about retailer. a never-could-have-guessed-it, feminine, textured twist on a classic. it's beautiful, it's comfortable. the cut is true to size (for me) and figure flattering.
1502	1	a	Gorgeous pattern and colors for autumn. maeve does me good when it comes to maxi dresses. i have to say that the sizing is all over the place! i am generally a medium, but the small and xs (?!) fit me well also. the stretchiness of the jersey is very comfortable and forgiving, except at the ruched waistband, which took longer to stretch out, but it did eventually. i do need to hem if i want to wear flats, but the length works for my higher heels. there are pockets and a lining to my knees. i am
1503	4	a	I saw this top and loved the pattern. meadow rue is one of my favorite brands for tops at retailer. the pattern is lovely and the fit it tts. this top is comfortable for running errands and can be dressed up too. very versatile for spring.
1504	4	a	I like this top. it went well with my olive pant. i tried in l and xl. l was a tad fitted around my tummy. xl armholes were too big and neckline was too low. i really wanted to keep this top but the low neckline just didn't work. i am busty, perhaps it may work better for a slender frame. i recommend this top because it is pretty, but the fit is selective, so its best to try out a couple of sizes first.
1505	4	a	This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin, and this style of top is usually quite flattering, but this one missed the mark big time.
1506	4	a	From unique shape to feminine design, this cropped summer sweater is the kind of item that attracted me to retailer thirteen years ago.  it's also flattering, especially for this petite, who doesn't like to show her upper arms.
1507	0	a	"Oh my god - i love this skirt. i first order the size 4 and immediately called customer service and had them send me a 2. i found it be be both plenty stretchy (great for moving, sitting, etc) but runs on the large size. but the fit is amazing. i love the length - a perfect knee-skimmer for me (5'9""). i love the color (green) and the pockets and button fly are so fun without being too much! i've tried it on with several tops and sweaters in my closet and this skirt is going to be one that i can"
1508	4	a	"I ordered this top in the pink in a medium (i usually wear a small or medium in retailer shirts). it fit tts with not being too short. the embrodiery is very pretty, better in person than online. my only complaint is it's a bit blousey, so you would need to either tuck it in or wear with skinny jeans/shorts. for reference, i am 5"" 4.5""' 135 lbs and a 32c."
1509	1	a	The dress is well made with a great material. it is extremely long and unless you are tall it would overpower many petite women. i returned it.
1510	4	a	I got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it. it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great. however, after i washed it the first time, it became clingy and stuck to me and doesn't lie right. it's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe!
1511	4	a	"The quality of this sweater is excellent. it is well work the money. i am 34d 5'4"" and purchased a medium. fits perfectly for a fitted look and hits right at my natural waistline."
1512	1	a	This dress is super sweet, but also unique with the reversed fabric on the skirt. it is true to size, unlike a lot of retailer clothes that seem to be boxy/run big. the fabric bunches a little bit at the waist though -- that's my only complaint.
1513	4	a	Better than a regular boring cardigan. goes with short sleeves and dresses!!
1514	1	a	I stumbled upon the blue version in the store. i immediately liked that it was easy, chic, and just different-enough. after wearing it for a birthday dinner, i saw it online and realized that i had styled it almost exactly the same way the blue one is shown. black sandal wedges, silver cuff, silver earrings. it is flattering in an unexpected way, which may be partially because i am really small-chested. the front v is deep compared to what i usually wear, but double-sided tape easily kept my bra
1515	0	a	I love these pilcro cropped chinos. i ordered them in the sand and will be ordering them in the grey. they are very soft and comfortable
1516	1	a	"Wow the mixed reviews on this dress would make someone not get it at all. it is true to size. i'm a 6 and the six fit as a glove on me. the material is not at all stiff. i actually wished it was a bit more structured. but that didn't bother me. i was able to close the zipper by myself. i'm 5'7"" 144lb 36a. the top feels confortable to me as well. i don't considered myself curve like jlo but i have hips. the dress does not make me feel bigger at all. the only down side is that it looks more expens"
1517	4	a	"The beautiful bold print drew me to this top and it did not disappoint upon receipt. however, the bottom ruffle belled so far out on each side that it was laughable! the actual fit is nothing like the picture; clearly the model's arms are placed in front of all the extra fabric to hold the ruffle back. however, the fabric is beautiful, the fit was perfect (size 2, 5'4"", 106 lbs.), the quality is great and i love the print so i decided to take it to my tailor to ""sew away"" the ""wings"" on both si"
1518	1	a	"I tried a size x small on in the store and i am 5'4"" 120 lbs. i had trouble getting my head through the dress, and once i did it felt so tight at the neck, as if it was chocking me. the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no. i would not recommend this dress for those reasons."
1519	4	a	I do like this top. i bought the cream color and it is flattering, but it is a little shear. i need to wear a cami underneath it. it also seems to be a little on the large side.
1520	4	a	This is a cute, fun addition to my wardrobe, especially since i am a polka dot fan! it is alittle short for me and i think it runs just a bit small, particularly if you want to wear like the model with longer shirt under it. overall, it was worth the sale price and will look good with casual pants, jeans and with dressier black pants for work.
1521	1	a	"I ordered this online in red. i would definitely say this color is more of an orange-red. i like the weight and the cut. i keep wishing the material was a soft modal vs what it is. the ribbing up top does not bother me but it definitely does make it a casual dress. (which is what i wanted so i'm happy with it)   it fits me nicely, the straps (for me) could be a hare shorter to fit perfectly. that being said, i'm 5'5"" and have a thin build. small bust. i would say there is a some leeway for 1 s"
1522	4	a	Love the print and loose fit. doesn't look to wide on my top heavy torso and the sleeves don't cling to my chubby upper arms or tummy. wore all day today, first with shorts then with cropped jeans.
1523	5	a	I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.
1524	4	a	"After reading all the reviews i figured at 40% off i could at least try it. i'm 5' 3"" and typically wear a m or size 10. i ordered the m, but as other reviews stated the arms were tight. since i'm expecting it to shrink, and want it to cover my booty, i ordered 2 colors in the l. it's exactly the oversized, slouchy look i wanted, without the neckline being too low, but will still be ok if it shrinks. i'll have these dry cleaned to minimize shrinkage. it's a wardrobe staple that looks great with"
1525	4	a	I bought the umbrella print in the petite length. i'm pleased with the whimsical print and crisp colors. the fit is just right for me, although the style runs a bit wide at the waist. it's a casual loose fit, more fitted on top at the bust, shoulders and sleeves, and flaring out below the waist. i would wear it untucked over jeans or a narrow skirt. the only thing i'm not crazy about is the rayon fabric, though it is a substantial weight and machine washable.
1526	2	a	I have these in grey and i love them! they are so comfy. i got them in m/l even though i am a s/m because i like the loose fit. they are very soft.
1527	0	a	Based on other reviews, i ordered these trousers in my regular size 8 (dark grey) and up one size10 (black motif). the size 8 fit perfectly; and the size 10 are too big (returning). i am not sure what the other reviewers experienced, but size 8 in this brand fits, regardless of style. i also prefer the solid grey, but that is just a personal choice. i felt the black motif trousers looked like pajama bottoms.
1528	1	a	"This beautiful, soft, swingy, dress is oversized on me.  usually when someone reviews that a dress runs large but their body type is opposite mine, i pick tts and 90% of the time i'm right.  not so in this case. the outer dress is very wide and the amazing super stretchy under slip is too large also.  debating on sizing down because of potential shrinkage after laundering.  i bought m and my stats are 5'3"" 140# 39/28/35.  dress ends just above my knees.   agreeing with the previous reviews th"
1529	4	a	Love this top! love that it ia jersey knit which makes it comfortable. love the print which makes it stand out. love the design of a side bow. i did not have an issue with the banded hem, in fact i like how it makes the top more structured.
1530	4	a	Gorgeous colors, great neckline (can be worn off one shoulder), the slits on the side allow for wear as tunic or as half tucked. very cute.
1531	4	a	"I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to"
1532	1	a	Such a beautiful pattern on a lovely fabric. soft to the touch and flows beautifully. i love the lacing and even the butterfly sleeves - which i'm usually not a fan or. i have a feeling i'm going to wear this to death once the weather warms up! my only complaint is the slip, which is a scratchy material that is also completely see through. it's also very short, at least for my comfort. i have a plain black slip i'll be using instead, which is fine with me as i bought the dress for the outer shel
1533	4	a	Very soft material, length is great, a little more loose than i would have liked.
1534	4	a	I liked this top so much that i purchased it in two colors: green and wine. the top and colors are exactly as pictured online, the material feels great, and they fit nicely. the fit was true to size.
1535	4	a	"This top takes every other tee and blows it out of the water! it appears subtle on the hanger, but it looks so lady like on! the flutter sleeve are darling. the top does have a lot of volume, but the drape is so lovely, it adds some shape. it is perfect to wear everyday and dress up! i bought to wear with the bryden skirt. for reference, i purchased ordered the xs (though i am wearing a s in the photo) and i am 34c, 26"" waist. the shoulder fit okay with easter size, but there was a little less v"
1536	1	a	I bought this dress to wear to work in my second trimester. the shape is perfect to accommodate a baby bump while still flattering the top. definitely recommend for any pregnant women trying to avoid true maternity clothes!
1537	4	a	I ordered the teal color - it is a beautiful color. the fit is a bit odd like one other person commented, but the pros outweigh the cons. i am thinking of ordering the other colors too.
1538	4	a	I love love this top. i was on the fence about it since it runs large and is loose fitting, very loose. i tried m, l, and xl. i usually wear xl but bought an l in this. i tried m, it was loose around the mid-section but fitted at the top. i wore them with fitted skinny pants and the top looks amazing. perfect for summer. the armholes also look flattering - not too big. i like turquoise. i didn't find yellow in the store, so bought green and white. it does need some ironing.
1539	4	a	"Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint. i ordered a xxs in black, and it was perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs. it definitely has a lot of volume to it, but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer, so you can ""see"" through it to your thinner figure underneath. it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it, which makes it flattering. another reviewer mentioned the beading turning. i have not seen that on mine, but now i will be looking for i"
1540	1	a	"I am 5'2"" and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p. lately i've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress. it fits well and it's flattering. my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy. yes, linen is a wrinkly look and that's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me. more importantly, while wearing for the first time, i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there"
1541	0	a	"These pants are simply darling! i purchased them with my birthday discount (thank you, retailer!) and even without a discount i think they are worth every penny. flattering, and the most important feature of any pant, makes my butt look good. don't hesitate, buy these today before they are out of stock.   the fit is true to size and the material is of excellent quality."
1542	4	a	I think this shawl is much more stunning on than on the hanger. i think it will be a great piece to transition into fall, wearing it over a black or white tee. it can be dressed up or down. especially for the sale price, a great piece!
1543	1	a	The stitching on this dress is absolutely beautiful and very detailed.
1544	1	a	"I am on the fence about this dress, as you'll see the reasons below, but it is really breathable fabric and extremely comfortable! _________ pros: - tons of stretch to the top part. i'm a 36c, so a lot of retailer tops are too snug for women with some bust. however, i fit into a medium here without it being too snug. you could actually go down or up depending on how loose or tight you'd like it to be on you. - the bottom half, the skirt, feels so nice on the skin. very breezy. it is layered an"
1545	2	a	I love this suit. the color is stunning and the quality of the material is excellent. a one piece never looked so good!
1546	4	a	Flowing top that looks great with skinny slacks... makes a great and comfortable work outfit.
1547	0	a	I absolutely loooove this skirt! its just as depicted. super comfy and warm. got tons of compliments wearing it. its just adorable. the colors are really rich and the design if the skirt made it avery flexible to wear with different styles of tops and sweaters. highly recommend!!
1548	4	a	I ordered xs/petite but i think i better ordered xxs which was already sold out at the time i purchased. i recommend one size smaller for this sweater. this sweater is designed very wide for your shoulder which could be fallen down for people who usually prefer petite size but it's really adorable!!
1549	1	a	I didn't think i'd like this due to the high neck, but i was in the store and it was so soft that i tried it on in the black motif. this dress is so comfortable and flattering. it's definitely a versatile piece: dress down with a denim jacket or dress up with heels. and it has pockets!
1550	5	a	I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately, some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost, this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.
1551	0	a	I absolutely love these shorts and have them in 3 colors. they are a great price point and comfortable fit. be careful with washing as the darker colors seem to bleed.
1552	4	a	I agree with previous review...looks so much better in person than online! i really do not need another poncho style sweater, but i could not resist. they colors and style are great!
1553	4	a	"I was so excited to get this top! i love the bow at the neck and the frill sleeves, so current. unfortunately, it was difficult for me to pull it over my head! the neck opening is too small, and there are no buttons. i have a pretty small head and very fine straight hair, so i can imagine that others will have a similar issue getting it on!  i am keeping it because i love the style, but will need to alter the neck myself. the rest of the top fits just a bit loose. i got the x-small and am a 3"
1554	1	a	This dress is beautiful on, is thin enough to be extremely comfortable. being curvy, it feels a little more narrow than i would prefer, but i kept it anyway because it is so beautiful as well as functional.
1555	5	a	"When i unwrapped this a chemical ""stink"" hit me that amost knocked me over. it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells. second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut. the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner. i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here. with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out. i do not recommend this fo"
1556	4	a	This is a bit pricey, but i think the akemi and kin quality is worth the price. this photo is quite inadequate to let you see the gorgeous dye color and floral detail. the sleeves are upturned and tacked; the curvy hem is very flattering, and the designer added a small triangle of cloth at the top of the curvy side, just to add to the careful, custom detail. the 60% cotton/40% modal is deliciously soft. the fine detail in cut, fit, artistic design will make this not simple tee a divine pleasure
1557	4	a	I love the cut and fit of this t. it's soft and has just enough flow to be comfortable without being unflattering. the gray floral print is very pretty. it's perfect with jeans or shorts in the summer.
1558	1	a	This is a lovely dress, but much more casual than i thought from the picture. the material is very thin and casual. i needed a dressier dress, and i didn't need another casual dress, so i sent it back, but it would be fine if you want something casual.
1559	4	a	The color is great. the fit is accurate and it is a great transitional piece.
1560	0	a	"This super cute skirt has a beautiful drape and overall fit. i was afraid the tie at the front would emphasize my slight tummy, but to the contrary, the skirt is flattering and slimming. at 5'3"", the front of the skirt hits at my upper to mid knee. 118 lbs., 26"" waist, 36"" hips, size 2 regular is a perfect fit."
1561	0	a	"I really love this piece. it's so different from anything else i own! the material has a lot of fine details to it that are hard to see in the photos. easy to dress up with a bit of jewelry and heels. the only downside is the upper body fit. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs with more of an hourglass shape. i did not fill out the top at all, although the shorts fit fine around my waist."
1562	1	a	"Just tried this dress on in the store and ordered a petite because i'm 5'. if you are even 5'2"" or taller i wouldn't recommend a petite fit unless you prefer the tunic length. this dress and material has a flattering drape for those of us with trouble belly regions."
1563	4	a	Yes, this top runs large and it doesn't show your curves, but it's still really cute and fun to wear. i first purchased the beautiful sage color, and after getting compliments, i also ordered the navy version. these tops are easy to wear, have an interesting detail at the neck, and could be layered. cozy, comfortable, stylish. love mine!
1564	0	a	I just got a pair of these in petite 28. and really like them. i am short though so even the petite length is too long for me- i wish it was the height of the cuff shorter than it is so i end up folding the cuff up. it still looks cute though. the stitching details are nice and quality seems good. hoping they hold up. the fabric seems durable if not a little too thick for hot summer weather but great for indoor a/c office temperatures. i am not going to buy another pair at full price but would c
1565	4	a	"The quality and design of this top is great and it goes well with my skinny jeans and wide-leg linen trousers. only thing is that it does need to air dry or i imagine it will shrink up which would not be good for taller frames. i'm slim, 5'8"" and got an xs and it fits just right. the carbon color appears to have hints of blue/purple on screen, but it's actually a plain dark gray."
1566	4	a	In retailer's defense, silk chiffon in general is super fragile. got the top in turquoise and the color and design are beautiful!! i'm 5'3 117 lbs and took an xs, fits true to size. i'm able to wear a nude strapless bra with the top and looks great. i have worn the top a couple of times and by the end of the day i had a few snags. i was able to pull the thread back inside the top, never ever cut silk chiffon. i love the top so much, i bought a second one in the same color and size as a back up. un
1567	1	a	I'm so impressed with the beautiful color combinations and embroidery but disappointed in the rayon fabric used, especially at this price point.  the sleeveless sheer blue outer dress is a flowy swing silhouette that retains many wrinkles.  i have thick shoulders and upper arms, so the armholes cut into my armpits.  the silky rayon liner is a blush rose color with adjustable spaghetti straps.  the slip has no stretch and feels a bit tight on my chest.  i ordered size medium petite and my stats a
1568	1	a	"I was so in love with this dress when i saw it in the store but so disappointed when i put it on. i am 5'10"" with curves and usually buy a large in dresses. this dress looked like a sack on me. the top was way too big and loose making the dress a boxy cut rather than a maxi cut like i was expecting. the dress is lovely to look at on the hanger and feels good on but i don't think it flatters hourglass figures. it was the right length for me unlike many other reviewers.  obviously, based off the"
1569	0	a	These are by far the sexiest fitting overalls ever! they are lengthening and flattering and comfy at the same time!
1570	0	a	These jeans are so adorable and so soft--i really wish they fit! unfortunately, even the next size up was too snug for me.
1571	2	a	The pictures are not showing how absolutely spectacular this caftan is. it is very delicate (even says so on the tag) and lightweight so that you won't dread wearing it in the heat of the day. by what doesn't show up is that this caftan shimmers-there is gold string woven throughout the entire garment which gives it a slight sheen. it adds significantly to the impact of the garment, and i love this detail. i love the way this caftan drapes, and i love that it is longer than a normal caftan. the
1572	1	a	This dress is so easy to wear! the neck line is not too low! can wear a regular bra!! it flows beautifully! i love it!!
1573	4	a	Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference, i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs, it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight, not trying to look pregnant!
1574	4	a	Got this today and am really pleased. beautiful detail and i love how the cowl neck hangs. it's not itchy at all. overall, a great find for the colder months ahead. i got a small and probably should have ordered xs  instead. runs a little big on my petite frame.
1575	1	a	This is a great dress from moving to summer into fall. it's great right now with the warm temps, but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit. it's very comfortable also. there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front. i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through. maybe, you can adjust it at the straps some. at any rate, it's a nice dress and i'm keeping it.
1576	4	a	This is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made! this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter. i am 5'9, a size 6/8 and the medium was perfect! buy this now!!
1577	1	a	It was a little shorter than i expected i am 5'8 and 125 pounds. i ordered the extra small and it was a perfect fit aside from length. at 42 yrs old, i can't wear mid thigh dresses to work. hit hit me at the same length it hit the model in the picture.... even though she is 5'10. if you are 5'6 and below this is a beautiful dress
1578	4	a	I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back, it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept, just didn't work for me.
1579	4	a	I just saw this in the store and loved it! it is shorter than pictured on the model, but it's not short. with a long shirt underneath, i'll wear it with leggings. the color is beautiful!! the size does run large - i normally wear a large at retailer, and i got this in a medium. i can't wait to wear it all fall and winter long!
1580	1	a	"I didn't have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress, i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy, itchy polyester-like fabric, not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black, not the plum color in 4/5 photos. but most importantly, i am 5'8"" and the dress is very short on me. it'"
1581	1	a	"I was thinking this was another maeve winner but this is actually plenty by tracy reese dress. i love the flowy fabric, the soft but vibrant colors and the gorgeous print. i wanted a size mp but that sold out so i purchased a regular m (with the intention to hem) and i find it too large in the bust. i'm going to order the sp instead too see if that fits better. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#."
1582	4	a	Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like i'm pregnant (not that there's anything wrong with that) very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf.
1583	1	a	This is one of my absolute favorite dresses of the season! fun, flirty and fashionable! i wore it with a chunky necklace, floppy hat and sandals one time and with wedges and dangly earrings the other time. it is a must own dress!
1584	0	a	I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!
1585	2	a	This piece fits true to size and is very flattering on. sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat, but this wasn't an issue at all, probably because of the intricate lace details. the fabric is substantial enough that i don't feel like it'll get a hole in it after multiple wears.
1586	4	a	Love this layering piece! a little low cut for my personal comfort, but a tank underneath works great.
1587	2	a	I ordered  flora nikrooz for my daughter for her wedding.  it is beautiful. the delivery was quick!!! very happy.
1588	4	a	I was drawn to this sweater for its vibrant colours and unique pattern. i tried it on and immediately fell in love with the comfort, quality, and design. it is a little short, but this minor issue is easily fixed with by wearing a neutral colored undershirt/camisole. the cuffed sleeves reveal a matching pattern and can be rolled down or up. i usually wear a xs or s in retailer's clothes, but i sized up to a m on this one. definitely worth it. this is a festive winter piece that can be dressed up o
1589	4	a	If you like a slightly heavier, non/clingy basic tee, this is it. i wore the long sleeved version all fall and winter, rotating colors, and i've been wearing these with shorts and leggings since i got them. the colors are great, fabric is quality, and the ribbon detail in the back gives these a little flare.
1590	4	a	Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.
1591	5	a	So different than anything in my closet. it's wide with a beautiful drape. fabric is soft but substantial. it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves. i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size. so cute on.
1592	1	a	I tried this in my normal sp. i found it to run a little snug, but the neckline was way too low for every-day wear.
1593	4	a	This top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure. i have 36ddd boobs and a muscular, curvy frame. this top adds about 20lbs.
1594	1	a	This dress is perfection! great, quality fabric. bright vibrant color. the design and texture allow it to be dressed up or dressed down. i sized up a size because my normal wasn't available and it fits perfectly!
1595	2	a	"These socks feel amazing-i have them in both colors.  you would be surprised at the softness of these socks, yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks. i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me. i feel like these would last a long time, with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spa-these socks are soft?  these socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li"
1596	0	a	These were not tts, imo. i am a 10 and ordered the m. they did not look bad, but b/c these have no stretch, they were not comfy, like joggers are supposed to be. i ordered the lg when they went on sale and while they are baggy, the comfort is spot on in the larger size. i got the navy after seeing the irl pics. happy with this sale purchase !
1597	1	a	I got the blue with polka dots. it fits more like a midi dress. it is a bit large, i'm usually a size 10 and got a size 8. it's gorgeous on. i don't think i'll be needing a bra underneath this. it's got a supportive band and the ribbon also helps. i might order the other bold print too, it just looks so good on.
1598	1	a	I am in lust with this fabulous dress. it's a feast for the eyes. it's so busy and detailed, yet it all works. fit on me is perfect. i did not have to size down or up. my upper torso is larger (m/l) than my bottom half (m/s). i also have a square waist. this dress makes me look like i have an hourglass figure. i love it as much as the mona dress. another point goes to ease of putting it on. i own six byron lars dresses and this is the *easiest* one to put on! just zip up and go.
1599	4	a	I liked this top, i really did. i also liked the subtle shimmer. the fabric didn't seem as soft, but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back. you can see it on the model here, but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just didn't look right. asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large, but here it is. the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader. i am sending it back.
1600	4	a	I really like this top, the material is thicker than i thought which is a good thing! it fits me very well and is very comfortable. i definitely recommend this shirt!
1601	2	a	The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.
1602	4	a	"I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod"
1603	1	a	"I literally bought this dress 2 days ago and now it is listed as ""no longer available"" on the retailer site. i am a size 12 with about a 36b-c bust. the thing i love about this dress is that it looks really nice without a bra. i was really surprised at how well constructed it was."
1604	1	a	I splurged on this dress when it was first in stock a year ago and haven't regretted it for a minute. it is my go to dress for work, cocktails, and once, two weddings in one day! the print is gorgeous and the fabric is super comfortable. i love twirling in it as the dress has just enough stretch with a little flounce. the length is ladylike and the sleeves provide perfect coverage for my arms. the seam between the bodice and the skirt hits right at your natural waist and the look really flatters
1605	5	a	I saw this online yesterday and i was in the store today to try it on. i assumed it would look average or below average on me and i could just walk away no problem. by no means am i in the financial bracket to be spending this much money on a jumpsuit, yet here i am at home wearing it as i write this review. it is surprisingly flattering. i am 5 feet tall and have a petite frame so wide leg pants never work on me, but this somehow did without making me look bulky. given my height, it comes to ab
1606	1	a	I love the cut of this dress! i have to be honest and say that i initially bought the blue color at the store and after falling in love i decided that i deserved to have the mango colored one as well after seeing my sister in it! the sizing is just a tab big but it works for the design. so i would say stick with your usual size. amazing pop of color especially for summer. the back design is gorgeous and the gold streaks running through it  are wonderful. do yourselves a favor and just try it on!
1607	4	a	I love this tank. i got it in the turquoise and just ordered the blue. this tank is indeed linen and does not wrinkle. it's fitted without being too tight. i have a somewhat shorter torso and narrow waist and athletic build and this looks great! i'm not a fan of flowy tops in general so thrilled to find this easy, casual piece. i ordered an xs but am usually either xs or s in retailer.
1608	1	a	This dress is lovely in person- light rose color and quality fabric. i'm a 32c and had to go down from my usual 2 to a 00 to get a proper fit in the bust and bodice. the full skirt leaves plenty of room to size down if necessary. this would work best on someone with a larger bust and small waist, but because of the cut i recommend trying on before buying. if you are smaller busted, the front tie can be adjusted slightly to get a better fit. the skirt portion is unlined, though, the fabric is thi
1609	1	a	This is the perfect holiday dress. my best purchase of the season!
1610	5	a	This dress is so beautiful! i ordered it online and when i received it i was so pleased with how it was even better in person. the fit, the embroidery, the lovely fall colors - makes this a perfect dress all the way around!
1611	0	a	"Great fit. love the mid rise! my usual size 28 in these leggings hug in all the right places. they look on me as in the model pic except the length falls abt 1"" below my ankles. i may have them hemmed after they're washed. just wait & see... 5'3"" 117#"
1612	0	a	I found these jeans on the sale rack at my local retailer. they were the very last pair and in my size. i couldn't believe my luck.  i tried them on and was very impressed with the fit and feel of the jeans. thyre soft yet substantial. they retain thier shape. . love the worn in look to them.  .. .. so adorable.  nice slouchy skinny jean.. i stayed true to size
1613	4	a	"This is a such a cute top. can be dressed up for work or worn more casually. very flattering. i'm 5'6"" and 125lb. i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more 'tunic-y.' bought two colors!"
1614	3	a	This jacket is perfect! the crop length is just right! not to short and the way it is cut longer in the back it really paints a beautiful silhouette on my larger frame. i'm a a 12 typically but broad in the shoulders and larger in the bust 36dd. this jacket is loose fitting and roomy. i could probably have gone with a large, but i'm really happy with the xl as i can layer underneath and it's just super roomy and comfy. the quality of this jacket is great. it will be a staple for years to come. i
1615	0	a	I knew i had to have these when i saw them on one of the retailer store instagrams. i bought them in the blue color combo and they are very comfortable and can be dressed up for work or paired with more casual clothing because of the material. they run a little large and have a lot of stretch so i would size down.
1616	0	a	Great jeans!!! i'm over 60 & it's difficult finding jeans. these fit like a glove, with just enough stretch & the twisted hem adds a bit of unexpected style. i liked them so much, i ordered another pair!
1617	4	a	This is a great little top. the tie sits right at the waist and loose enough to slide over top of pants or shorts. the detailing at neck and shoulders is very eye catching. i received several compliments when i wore it.
1618	1	a	Just as the others have reviewed, i agree! this dress is flowy and so feminine. i got it today and i am wearing it now! so light! i usually wear a large or a 12 in dresses. i am pear shaped. 36b bust and large hips. it is flattering and feels great on. the slip underneath fits perfect on me. grab this before it becomes iso!
1619	2	a	"These are really stunning. they look exactly like the picture with the pattern matching up perfectly at the seams. i love the mirror image pattern. they're just a bit snug where at first i thought i might not be able to get them on, but once on, they actually fit perfectly. so, i think that's actually how yoga pants are supposed to fit. i'm 115, 5'6"" and i got the xs."
1620	1	a	I've never owned a romper, and never had any desire to. but the classy design in black, soft, flowy fabric reeled me in, prompting me to push my boundaries a bit. i'm so glad i did. i don't think i have any other piece of clothing that makes me feel so classy or so fun, and certainly not at the same time. i wear it to work in an office environment with a cardigan, and the cardigan goes off after work as i run errands or play with the kids. i love it!! (and it even has pockets - i'm a sucker for
1621	1	a	Gorgeous dress but fits really large. ordered a petite large. going to send it back and try the petite medium. wish it was available at my store to try on and not have to wait for it to be reshipped.
1622	3	a	"Love the coat. style and fit are a perfect fit. true to size. thanks for the previous reviews about the button. i am extra careful taking it on and off. versatile. take the collar off and wear on a sweater or whatever inspires you."
1623	0	a	Super cute and more fitted than the baggy overalls of yesteryear. i love them.
1624	1	a	This dress has special written all over it. the poms at the hem and bodice, as well as the rows of black seed beads push are the kind of details that stand out. i like all the varying textures. it looks great with sandals or short boots. fits true to size. a nice sassy length.
1625	0	a	Love the wash and fit of this jean. the perfect summer go to for me.
1626	2	a	Very cozy lounge tee, but runs large. i ordered a small rather than my usual medium and could of probably went down two sizes.
1627	4	a	"I love the fit and the color. i would buy this t-shirt again in other patterns and colors. the fabric is thin and lightweight, but i knew that when i bought it. ( apparently, nothing this is a problem for some others.) i do choose to wear a camisole or a tank top underneath it. to preserve the fabric, i hang dry after laundering. the colors have not faded, and the fabric is holding up well. i am 5'4"", weigh 134 lbs, and do typically wear size medium."
1628	0	a	"Love me some pilcro jeans! these fit like the stet jeans.  i got my usual size 27p and the fit is good but not too tight. i am not crazy about the hem but they feel so good that they are worth it. they don't come above my ankle like on the model but come slightly below which i really like. i will say that if you want a true black, you may not like this color. they are more of a faded black."
1629	4	a	I ordered this shirt to wear with a pair of pants that i had to return - which is one reason the top went back as well. it really is cute and i like the exaggerated key hole in the back. i certainly could have found other things to pair with this top, but it came down to the price. i just didn't think it said $118. hopefully its still around when it goes on sale. its very cute. fits true to size.
1630	4	a	"This top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased. i really love it. it is different than i thought it would be. i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow. definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large.  definitely recommend."
1631	4	a	Great shirt. i couldn't picture the material but it's washable and great for hot days when you want to look styling.
1632	1	a	"I love this dress so much that i bought it in 2 colors: one in blue and one in orange. great style, comfortable and quality material. however, the cut is much, much deeper than it appears in the pictures. women with bust should be conscious of that.   the blue is the better color. the orange looks more like a fluorescent, red-orange. still cute, but not as subtly muted as it appears in the pics.   overall, great dress. even better with the sale price."
1633	4	a	I'm not in love with this, but the husband thinks it looks cute and the sale price isn't bad so i'm keeping it. i got it in s, and am usually an xs or s in retailer tops (34b, 26 inch waist, 120lbs). if i had gone with xs it probably would've been too tight in the shoulders. however i could be 6 months pregnant and you wouldn't know it. it is very boxy in the torso, and i realize the design is for it to be flowy, as the back is partially split. but it looks relatively fitted on the model, which is
1634	4	a	I bought this to use over the holidays. it is extremely comfortable and i've received multiple complements. you can dress it up or wear it casual.
1635	1	a	"Let me preface this by saying, im totally keeping this dress!  it is kind of a weird design, but intriguing. i received it in the mail yesterday, i am 5'6"", 125 lbs and have hips. as a previous reviewer mentioned, this dress is more fitted than a swing dress as it appears. fortunately the xs fit me just right - but i cannot gain another lb.  my husband said that i looked like i was in a choir because of the higher neck design and bell sleeves, but he too found the dress somewhat alluring."
1636	1	a	I'm bought this dress at 16 weeks pregnant and am loving it! the top drapes, but is still form-fitting enough to show off a little bump. i've received so many compliments. the skirt is short, but i love it, makes legs look great with tights! i sized up a little to allow for room to grow.
1637	1	a	I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it's a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass.  had to send it back.
1638	4	a	I totally disagree with previous reviewer on sizing. i am usually a medium (sometimes small) in various retailer tops and i purchased this top in a small. i could barely get it over my head. i then ordered the medium and large. i tried the large on first and it fits perfectly. (like the model shot). so i would say this definitely runs small. i never wear a large. for reference, i am 36c, broad shoulder. the gold beading on the top is very pretty and the gold embroidery thread really pops. t
1639	2	a	The floral print and colors are so pretty for summer that it's tempting to layer this over a seamless tank and wear it out!
1640	4	a	It's a rather boring tank. i thought it'd be perfect under a cardigan for work, but decided against it. the fit is boxy, and does not look good on a girl with curves.
1641	1	a	I love this dress! it is comfortable and pretty, well made and classic. it edges toward the larger size however it is supposed to be big. i got a small and at first it looked too big but the shoulders are perfect. i feel like sissy spacek in this gown and you will also!
1642	1	a	"This is a beautiful dress with unfortunate design flaws at the bodice of the dress. the fit at hips and length is perfect, falling just to my knee (i'm 5'5"" 142 lbs.) and grazing my hips. in that regard the fit is spectacular. but the bodice seems cut very oddly, which would require tayloring to correct. the armholes are large and flared at the bottom which leaves 'wings' just under the arms that stick out. since this dress has a side zip, to correct that would seem a major undertaking. the stra"
1643	1	a	"I am between a xs and s but figured i would order down based on the reviews. well, it's still huge. i have about 5 inches that i can take in from the side. i have ordered the xxs and am hoping it will look more flattering. i love the colors and design, but as it is it does not do anything for me. for reference i am 124 lbs, 32d, 5'5""."
1644	1	a	This dress is just lovely--i love the pattern and the cut, and it's very comfortable to wear. i like it because i can wear it just about anywhere, and it's appropriate. you can dress it up or down. i get lots of compliments when i wear it!
1645	4	a	I loved the criss cross part of this tank. however, it looked so frumpy on. the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent. i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on. i returned it. the material felt nice too.
1646	4	a	"Drapes very nicely and runs true to size. easy to wear alone or layer a jacket/cardigan over. i purchased this on sale, and it was a good buy. i am 5'8"" and purchased the size m, as i am a pretty true size 6."
1647	1	a	"I really love the colors of this dress - very unique and classy combo. little bit of a retro look to it. even though there is no zipper it's somehow fitted and flattering. i plan to wear it to a wedding this summer in the mountains where it gets chilly in the evening so i'm thrilled to find a summer dress with sleeves. it will work well for plenty of other occasions too. only problem is the buttons on the sleeves are nearly impossible to button. just too tight. for reference i'm 5'9"", 140 lbs an"
1648	4	a	I had been eyeing this top for awhile and decided to get it when it went on sale. it is a very nice top. i'm going to pair it with jeans and boots for our florida fall but could see it working with a nice pair of pants. it is roomy so if you're looking for something more fitted than i would pass on this top.
1649	4	a	I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic,that will be in my closet for a long time.
1650	3	a	I tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it. the picture does not do it justice. it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality. fabric is very soft and light weight. highly recommend!
1651	1	a	"So much to love about this dress! the color is exactly as pictured in the video, not photos. the fabric is substantial, beautiful colors. the dress is well constructed , back zipper and is easy to put on and take off. it is not only lined but has a crinoline built in to the liner! it's not super puffy, just enough to give it some flare. i am 36b, 5'8"", 155 lbs and bought a 10. it fits me perfectly! the shoulders are a smidge too big but not enough for me to have them taken up just yet. oh, and i"
1652	4	a	Fits really nicely and i'm picky about sleeves but these are just right. a little see through but i don't have to wear anything under it because the seams and piecing cover well. love the fit not too blousy in the waist and the assymetrical hem is nice.
1653	4	a	I saw this shirt in store a while ago, but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it. however, when it went on sale and there was an extra 40%, i decided to get it. i like the top, it's cute and fun. however, it does poof out a little in the midline. this top goes great with jeans or shorts, and it is cute, but definitely not worth full price for this.
1654	5	a	This dress runs so large, why did they not make an extra small. the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering. i wish wish that they made this in the extra small, i was swimming in it, there was no way to fix it so it went back
1655	0	a	I love ag jeans to begin with but even still sometimes certain styles miss the mark (at least on my body type). i was pleasantly surprised with this pair and even though they are pricey, i couldn't pass them up. they miraculously stay on my hips and i don't find myself pulling them up every few minutes. hallelujah! other than that they are  stretchy and soft with out losing their shape. they hit right at the ankle for me (5'2). the hem is frayed which i'm hoping doesn't unravel too much with was
1656	1	a	I took everyone's advice and purchased a size small instead if medium.  i wish i had gotten my usual size as the neckline and bodice is very tight.  i'm top heavy with a wide rib cage and 36dd's.   other than that, the skirt of this mango hued beauty is large loose and flowing which i can see why people suggest sizing down.  i think my fit problem would be solved if petite was available.
1657	4	a	I love this top, the beading and detail is wonderful, i actually liked it even more when i saw it in person. but when i tried it on it is really small in the neck and arm openings and seems short, definitely a different fit than how it appears on the model. i'm trading in for a size up and hoping that does the trick!
1658	4	a	Great fabric, great fit, great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!
1659	1	a	Someone returned my size so i got to try it on in store. the cut is very flattering, the material is stretchy. the lace part is nicely made too. overall great piece. the petite waist did hit me a little higher than on model, i have a regular torso and short legs (and overall usually need petite)
1660	4	a	I do love this shirt, but when it arrived, it had makeup around the collar, apparently from someone else who had tried it on. i was able to clean it up with just soap and water so no big problem, but it did make for a poor first impression!
1661	1	a	"This dress was so lovely in person, but when i put it on...ooh la la! it is short! i am 5' 3"" and i would not walk outside in this dress without something underneath. it just needed one more tier and i would have kept it for sure. too bad!"
1662	0	a	Fits just like on the model, even though im 5'4''. really happy with this casual summer find.
1663	1	a	"This is the second dress i buy at retailer this year and this one is spot on!! exactly what i was looking for: feminine, dressy yet can be dressed up or down depending on the circumstance. the fabric in this dress is particularly gorgeous, very comfortable on the skin, very flowy so it doesn't have a ""heavy"" quality to it and the design is amazing with the navy ribbon on the front. i completely fell in love with this dress! this is a little number to keep for many years."
1664	0	a	I love j brand, however the fit of these jeans was all wrong for me. they were perfect from the knee up, however they stuck out too much at the bottom. a slight taper from the knee down would have made them perfect. i had to return them.
1665	1	a	This dress was absolutely beautiful in person, but it didn't end up working out for me. i wear a 10, the 10 fit, but i have a 34g chest and because of that the waistline didn't sit low enough - it was just below my bust instead of at my natural waist. i really wanted this to work and think it would be great for the right person. seemed tts. love the detailing!
1666	4	a	"This top is adorable on. the online picture doesn't do it justice. a sales girl in my store had it on and i loved it and had to try it on. i got it in xs - black. i am 5'2"" and 115 lbs. it has the perfect drape to it. it might be too cool for winter but will be perfect when it warms up a little. this was my favorite thing i found in the store in months. love it."
1667	1	a	Perfect summer dress: feminine, cool, with just the right flow. hides the bad, and has a nice shape.
1668	1	a	This dress is very versatile. it is comfortable and very flattering. the armholes were not too big. you do need to wear a bra that crosses in the back if you do not want the straps to show. i purchased the red/pink color and it is very vibrant and not see through at all. the length is great as it is above the knee by a few inches, it accentuates the best part of the leg. it also can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or more casual with flatter shoes. it is a classic style, not trendy so it wi
1669	0	a	This is the 4th pair of current/elliot jeans i've bought.  i'm 5'4 so the length is perfect for flats.  they are so soft and cozy. wish they had a design on the pockets but love them none the less!
1670	0	a	"The fox print is super cute and the reason i ordered the skirt.  sizing was true to me, i'm usually an 8 and the 8 fit fine.  the waist is high and if you try to wear it low the side zipper puckers  out in a weird way.  skirt length is above knee (i'm 5' 6"").  skirt is lined but the lining is dark brown/black same as the waist band in the photo of the model wearing it.  the lining does not show at the hem, it's concealed.  overall a fun a-line swingy skirt for late summer that will go into fall"
1671	2	a	It's so hard to tell exactly what this sweatshirt looks like from the online photos. it has a white and pale sky blue tie dye look all over with a sea foam green floral print. runs tts. the floral print isn't centered on the one i received, but for $11 i'll be keeping it.
1672	1	a	I really wanted to love this dress. the cut out design is beautiful and it is very feminine. however, it does not really cut in at the waist and it left me feeling a bit boxy. i think if it cinched at the waist, it would be perfect. it didn't work out for me, but i think on the right girl, it would be very cute.
1673	0	a	I read the other reviews on this skirt and tried the 4 and the 6 (i'm between the two sizes, typically) in case it ran small. technically it does. the 4 is tighter, but it looks better sitting higher on my waist. the 6 is looser, but doesn't look as good. likely sticking with the 4. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light and high quality. it can be dressed up or down.
1674	0	a	"Love the cut and the way they drape. size 26 and 5'6"" 135lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour. all of a sudden my 26s became 28s. they were practically falling off. i plan to wash them to see if they shrink. i wish they held their shape since they are so cute."
1675	4	a	I love these t.la tees, and i buy them often. i find them to be very versatile and super soft. i have several colors and they hold up well if you wash and hang dry. i am a small in most retailer tops and these are no exception. they wear well under jean jackets or even a long-sleeve button-down shirt.
1676	2	a	This twist front top fits true to size, it is perfect! i really love the ruched sides, i like a longer tankini but most of them the stomach area is too wide and flowy. this one is perfect, it hugs your sides and looks great to wear with my kids but still flirty with my husband! i got the navy top and the side tie bottoms in navy/periwinkle and they are so cute together, can't wait to hit the beach!!
1677	4	a	I like this top and agree that it does run large. i find the fabric to be somewhat heavy which i consider a good thing as it will hang nicely and do a good job of hiding *imperfections*. it does have a pleat in the back which is not so apparent in the photo here. i love the neckline... a slight bit of a *v* neck.
1678	1	a	Looks so beautiful.... on a hanger. does not really do anything on a person. beautiful beading but the dress on is very sack-like. i will be returning it
1679	4	a	"I got this top in navy and i love it. it's loose and flowy and comfortable, yet dressy enough to wear for work (or dress down with jeans). i'm 5'4"", 125lbs and the 6 was a bit large on me. i could've sized down a little but i actually liked the loose fit, and the length was long enough to tuck in if i wanted to. definitely recommend."
1680	4	a	I put this runs small but it's a little more tts, except the arms are very slim! if you like to push your sleeves up like this model, you will have to wait for a while to see if the sweater loosens up. length wise it fit me a bit longer than this model and i'm a petite. the color is also darker and not as red as in this sweaters, which i actually prefer. the sweater is much thicker than my other cashmere sweaters. some of the stitching seems stick out as if the sweater is worn inside out, but th
1681	0	a	An excellent going out to dinner, to a lounge, etc. piece. super flattering, sexy, feminine and trendy! can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories. i'm only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits, but this was excellent!
1682	0	a	"I ordered a pair online, they came today and i am in love! the fit is great, i love the high rise waist. i will have to hem the bottom, i am a tad short (5'3"") and it is rare that i don't have to hem my jeans. they make my legs look longer and are a very flattering fit. i am very pleased with my purchase."
1683	1	a	This dress might be the most comfortable article of clothing i own, especially for the hot summers. it is attractively loose, and so light that you barely feel like you are wearing it. love it!
1684	0	a	"I'm 5'6"" about 120 and usually a 0/2 in retailer... the size 2 in this skirt fit at my natural waist perfectly with enough room to move comfortably. on the hanger and from the photo i didn't think i'd like it, but once on it's really pretty and the fabric looks so nice, it has great movement, and is really flattering."
1685	4	a	Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.
1686	1	a	"I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however, the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else.   sadly, dress had to be returned."
1687	4	a	I love cashmere, love the length, cowl-neck and colors, however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person, which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price.
1688	1	a	This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.
1689	4	a	I bought this top for work and going out.  it is a beautiful top that goes with many items in my closet like my red blazer, grey blazer, red cardigan etc.  it is very flattering.  the arm holes weren't too big.  fit tts.
1690	4	a	This sweater is wonderful for late summer/early fall or cooler weather over long sleeves. the sleeves taper just below the elbow, which seems slightly odd when first putting it on - as though they should be a tad longer (hence the 4 stars), but i quickly forget about this while wearing the sweater and it does look great!
1691	1	a	I loved this dress so much i got it in 2 colors. i had to send it back twice to get the size right. i ended up with a medium. the fabric was pretty wrinkly on arrival. it is dryclean only. overall it is an easy and relaxed dress appropriate for work but still very cute.
1692	4	a	The melon color is soft and flattering. it is a little on the long side in the back, but i paired it with a lightweight, flowy sweater, and received compliments.
1693	0	a	These pants are my favorite! not only is the fit slimming and perfect, but i get compliments on the design every single time i wear them. i absolutely love these, well worth the money.
1694	3	a	I've had this jacket for a few weeks and it has been a terrific transition piece for the spring. this is a lightweight layering piece without any lining. it works well as a topper for cooler morning temps and you can still wear it later in the day without perspiring through it. i bought it in the olive color, which works with just about everything and the xs was tts (for reference-5'4,116 lbs.). the fit is slightly boxy with a nice swing and drape in the back. for those concerned about the back
1695	0	a	"Loved these culottes! flattering fit and nice drape. the fabric, though poly, is of a nice weight and swishes nicely as you walk. the length (just below knee length) works for me too. the color is lovely for the fall - rich copper and easy to pair . i'd say these are tts but if in doubt, size down. i""m between a size 8-10 and the 8 works best for me."
1696	4	a	This sweater looks great with chambray colored denim. i wear it with jeans, shift dresses and even leggings. definitely one of my go to sweaters for the fall.
1697	4	a	"Love this blouse--looks like a fp blouse yet a bit cheaper and well made! looks feminine and edgy on. may size out for taller gals b/c it is a bit on the shorter length. i am 5'5"" and the length is just right on me untucked. the lace on the sleeves are gorgeous and neckline is not too high!"
1698	1	a	"This dress runs large! i tried on a large, then a medium and then a small! couldn't believe i fit a small! this is a cool, breezy summer ensemble that you can wear anywhere! dress it up or down, it's comfy and makes you feel like you can breathe under its baggy motif. love it!!"
1699	4	a	I purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking. though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust. and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy. for a looser fit you may want to size up. for a more fitted look it is true to size.
1700	4	a	This t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything. my only concern is the fabric is super light. not enough to be see through, but just enough to make me question the quality. i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though. the drape is nice and not super revealing; discreet enough for work. i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile.
1701	4	a	This sweater is beautiful! not only is the lace front gorgeous, but it is incredibly comfortable and so well crafted. definitely my favorite cardigan now.
1702	4	a	I tried this on when i saw it hanging in the dressing room. i was pleasantly surprised by this piece. the color is beautiful - not too yellow - not too brown. i have not worn it yet so i'm assuming it will hold up pretty well considering my other pieces from this designer are still looking good with several wears. i bought this in a small size so it does not hang down like it does on the model. perhaps that's why i don't need a cami underneath.
1703	4	a	I had high hopes for this cool top. i ordered it in xxs because no petites were available at the time, and i think the size is just right (i'm +/- 105 lbs, 34aa). i just suspect it looks better on people with broad shoulders, like the models'; mine are kind of narrow. plus, crew necks aren't the most flattering neckline on me. i would say it's fairly short, just barely covering my belt, so on taller people it may be cropped, and the waist is kind of fitted, as shown. i love that it's cotton, mad
1704	1	a	This dress is absolutely like a layered cloud! the material is amazingly soft and comfy.
1705	0	a	"This jumpsuit is all the things other reviewers have stated: roomy, flattering, has give. however, note: the way in and out of this outfit is a single button with a loop at the top of the back. if you need to run to the restroom - plan. it can be an absolute pain to get out of this outfit to go to the restroom. let's not talk about the possibilities of the outfit dropping on a public restroom floor...yes, i went there...  i would have preferred separates to a single piece. you could achieve th"
1706	2	a	I love the design of these. the laser cut outs are solid and hold up in the wash. they are great for work-outs and cute enough to wear as leggings out. i wore them to my bar method class, came home and just changed my top and continued wearing them the rest of the day as a cute outfit. they have a great snug fit and the fabric is thick and durable.
1707	3	a	But tight around the chest, i ordered xs petite after trying on xxs petite and both are a tad tight on the chest area, kept xs petites as bigger would be too much fabric everywhere else. green color is classic, and the back is longer than the front. overall flattering if with the right outfit. i'm 30 dd and 115 lbs for reference.
1708	0	a	I love these. the color and the style. but they are once again too short. they are not 33 inches. i need 32 inches to go to the floor. these are above the floor so they are not 33 inches. very disappointing.
1709	0	a	The blue on this jumpsuit is actually a little darker than pictured. it's very cute on but i would order a size down for a more fitted look. my usual 0 petite had some extra fabric that layed awkwardly on my body.
1710	1	a	I love this dress. the fabric is butter soft, the strapless top stays in place and it hangs beautifully. it is such a wonderfully comfortable summer dress. as previously stated, i'm in love.
1711	4	a	Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.
1712	0	a	I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then, because i loved the cut of these pants, bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again, nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur
1713	4	a	"Very cute adorable shape tank top but extremely huge   does not come in petite and is not even close to fitting me   extra small is like a medium   not a sky color , like the picture it is a black-and-white type of the shirt which needs a thin camisole underneath  shirt is definitely white but would look great with the black or gray camisole underneath   better for taller larger sized people"
1714	4	a	"I bought the tiny brand ""cassia"" tank last week in a small, and it fits beautifully. i ordered this ""sorcha"" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another."
1715	4	a	This blouse is made out of a high-quality material, flows beautifully, and the neutral flower pattern makes its yellow/green base pop. i played with a bow and decided that it looks the best tied lower than on the model to form v shaped neckline. this piece will transition easily from one season to the next and from causal to dressy. for the reference, size 12 was the best fit form my curvy 36dd frame.
1716	1	a	I tried this on in a different retailer a couple of weeks ago... ....tried on a different one last night..same size and it looked baggy, sleeves way too long, etc.  let me add that i am usually a xs/s petite but some regular extra smalls will work also.  this was a xs reg.  even the sa could see that one looked like it fit smaller ( i showed her the photo in my phone) while this one swallowed me.  bottom line, you will need to try this one on as the sizes seem to vary.
1717	1	a	I thought this dress looked really cute and many people gave it great reviews. for me, there were a few key things off for it to work. i thought the material was soft, although not thick as you might expect with a turtleneck style dress. i ordered a small and the top fit ok, the arms were a little tight. then the larger problem was the body, it hides everything which is great but the way it fell and just sort of hung there, it didn't do anything for my figure and was not flattering around the wa
1718	2	a	Such a beautiful pattern - i think you could wear it with a skirt and it wouldn't even read as a bathing suit. love the lacy pattern in front. great fit. i bought a medium, when i usually wear a small in retailer. it fits a little loose, so i'd probably buy a small if i bought another one, but it all depends on how you like your suits to fit.
1719	2	a	I absolutely love these sleep pants. they are very comfortable and the cute tea cups print makes them fun. i have washed them and put them in the dryer and they didn't fade or shrink. grab a pair while you still can you won't regret it.
1720	1	a	I had this dress in my basket for a long tiem waiting for free shipping. i liekd how it looked on the model. read the reviews, and wasn't sure, so waited... then my usual size sold out, so i decided ot try the smaller size (in petites, otherwsie i would have gotten it in the store :_)) i needed pettie and the smaller size is perfect! the color says black, but it looks more mifnight (aka blue), my friend even said (when i tried it on), you know i laways love anything blue... so don't expect dark
1721	5	a	It's like a work of art, but sadly, not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look, and even considered taking it to a tailor, but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips, you might love it. very sad to return this.
1722	4	a	I tend to size up when ordering tops online as i find a lot of retailer stuff to be inconsistent. a little big is better than something way to small. well that was a mistake with this top. i sized up and it was much too large everywhere, more so than i thought it would be. but the neck, there's no button or hook and i could barely get the top over my head! if i had gotten a size smaller i wonder if it would have ripped as i pulled it on. cute top, material is so-so.
1723	1	a	I loved this dress when i tried it on. the plaid is darling and the plunge is sexy. i so wish it would work for my body type. the waist came a bit too high on me (almost a line) and it made me look kind of frumpy in the midline.
1724	4	a	I ordered this top in the pretty, sea glass green color. it is adorable on! it's constructed from a nice thick cotton and has a billowy swing look if you are into that, which i am. the cut of the neckline gives it a cool 60's vibe. my only issue is that the arm holes are cut small. also note that because of the wider neckline, i found putting a necklace on squashed it in a strange way. i'm still keeping it because it is awesome in every other aspect. most likely i will just jazz it up with fun e
1725	4	a	"The picture is not a good representation of the cut and the fabric. the cut is a-line, trapezoid-shaped. the shirt is smallest in the shoulders and chest and then it flairs out to the sides. the cut works with pants mostly, you have to tuck the shirt in if wearing with skirts. the lace back drapes beautifully and is a little longer than the front, which again lend to wearing with skinny pants and such. the fabric has a quality of freshly starched. pleasant surprise. it lacks softness of leisure"
1726	1	a	Very comfortable to wear, love the overall look of this dress.
1727	2	a	I saw this in the store and had to try it on. luckily i grabbed a couple sizes before heading to the dressing room since i thought it looked large but wanted to get the best look. i normally wear a large in most retailer items and if you want a really roomy look you could go for your normal size but i liked it a little more fitted and ended up getting a small. i plan to wear it over jeans or leggings. the delicate embroidery and details are so pretty. the stick out sides look a little funny but if
1728	3	a	Absolutely love the jacket! wore it out in nyc at a rooftop bar and many people complimented on it. the faux fur is soft and pink color is beautiful. it is trendy but classy and can be worn dressy or dressed down with boyfriend jeans and booties. perfect transitional jacket from day to night =-)
1729	4	a	I love this shirt! it's such a beautiful striking color, yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight. the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute. i bought another one of these when it went on sale. so now i have two just in case;) haha
1730	1	a	Beautiful dress. i just wore this dress for my wedding. it was a beautiful wedding dress and i got many compliments on the uniqueness and the beading detail. there was one really big problem. the beads and the flowers kept falling off. i sat down and stood up leaving a pile of little flowers and beads. i could be standing still and they would periodically drop off. it was kind of embarrassing and everyone remarked that i was my own flower girl. i am still finding pieces of the dress everywhere.
1731	3	a	I loved this vest from the moment i saw it. sadly, though, it runs way too large. i first ordered it in a small and then an xs when it popped back. even the xs was too large around my shoulders and waist. the color was also a bit more beige than in the photos, which was ok, but i had to return it because of the size.
1732	0	a	I ordered these jeans to wear to work since they are very dark and tailored. my usual size 26 fit perfectly, but they did have to go to the tailors since they were incredibly long, which is nice for those of you that need more length.given that i usually am in skinnies, i like how they fit singly on the hips and slightly flare out towards the bottom, but not too much. these will work well with a variety of looks, making the price tag well worth it.
1733	4	a	"I loved the material's texture and drape, but it was too sheer for me. i am 100% against having to wear a tank under white tees. (which means i have a lot of trouble finding any white tees, but...)   other than the see-through nature, i loved this shirt!"
1734	1	a	This is a cute dress, but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on. i can't risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it. especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup, anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle.
1735	0	a	"Not what i was expecting, but pleasantly surprised.  was envisioning a more structured/tailored trouser, but these are closer to leggings, albeit very substantial ones with ""real pant"" touches like a zip/button front and (faux) pockets.  they're form fitting, soft yet supportive, stretchy, incredibly comfortable, and tts.  i'm a pretty legit 10 in pants (30/31), and the 10's near perfect, with the rise coming right to my belly button.  think i'll grab another pair now while they're available."
1736	4	a	I just purchased this at my local retailer..the online pix does not do it justice! so pretty & delicate..casual, comfortable fitting..hits right at the hips...
1737	4	a	Love! received so many compliments! it can be dressed up or down and is so comfortable.  i did order a l  based on the reviews, but found it to be big.  i would've returned for a m, but it was sold out and i didn't want to risk not having it at all so i kept.
1738	4	a	"I wear ddd so i do wear a strapless with this and it looks great. the plan looks fantastic with any color wash of jeans. i love it"
1739	0	a	These ran very small compared to other charlie pants i've bought in the past. even sizing up, the stripes were not flattering. the lady in the next dressing room over tried them on, too, and had the same feeling i did. the less curvy you are, the better stripes look. they more curvy you are, the less flattering stripes on pants look. the way the stripes come together at the seams just isn't flattering.
1740	5	a	"My skirt arrived this week and its beautiful! i'm so happy i splurged on it. i'm usually a size 6 and the medium fits perfect, although it is quite long (i'm 5'2"" though;). i will probably get it hemmed, but went ahead and wore it anyway and actually found i like it a bit long and its very comfortable. the fabric is very high quality and the color is stunning."
1741	4	a	"I love this top! i ordered it in a medium, and it's perfect. i'm 47 years old, 5'2"", 125 lbs, for reference. the detail on this top is beautiful. can be paired with so many things. love it!!!"
1742	4	a	This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!
1743	4	a	Really fantastic shirt. ordered multiple colors and will keep them all. the gray especially looks a bit boring online, but is gorgeous in real life. it has different shades mixed together and is really pretty. neckline is interesting. wish the front was a tad shorter, (i'm 5'4) but don't think petite will work. really, really great shirt.
1744	0	a	These pants are super funky. the colors have a 70's vibe. retailer do the pants a disservice styling them like the image on the website. they are playfully chic. besides the look, they are super comfy and have a nice stretch. perfect for my job as an art teacher. give them a shot!
1745	4	a	"I purchased both colors offered and love this light weight full of neat detail piece to layer with other tops. the material is very soft and stretchy making it easy to wear over another item. i love the little shirt tail detail in back along with the drawstring trim in front. another piece that i am sure i will wear for years to come and the fit is true to size. thanks antro!"
1746	0	a	"I don'tr even know why they btohered making a tall size for this, i would need a 6-7 inch heel for the petite version, which means regualr sized people should get petite. also, bigger, as in loose, i tried 0 and 2 and both ewre biggish (thopugh i could honestly not tell the difference). sales person told me to try 00, so we shall see... i will need to hem them if i kleep them though.  bronze color is very nice, so is balck, i ordered both for comparison.  lastly, cut is very flattering,especiall"
1747	4	a	"Lets discuss the neckline: it's fabulous! furthermore, this sweater can go anywhere, it's dress up, dress down.  feeling low? this girl will lift you up and take you to town."
1748	4	a	I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5'6 120 and usually a s fits. however, this was really tight. also, the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one.
1749	3	a	I really love this brand and i love the fit of this blazer. my bottons were loose on this jacket and i got the rose color too and i do agree with the other reviewer that the color is more terra-cotta. great for spring and cool summer night. it runs tts im a 36dd and the medium fit nice.
1750	1	a	"This dress is a beautiful classic ! i am 5""3 113 size 0 fits perfectly !"
1751	4	a	"Love this shirt. i am 5'2"" and 115 lbs. i am normally a pxs and got the pxxs and it got perfect! my new favorite shirt."
1752	4	a	I normally get a small in this style shirt but it didn't fit at all so i had to send it back. too bad
1753	4	a	Bought this top for date night -- something a little special. it's that and also very comfortable. i have broad shoulders and this style accommodates. easy to dress up or down -- perfect!
1754	4	a	Very nice soft fabric, has a nice swingy drape and flair. i use it to work out in , sleep in and just hang out around the house. could be paired with white pink or black leggings and a scarf too. very happy with this purchase.
1755	4	a	I purchased this when it was on sale and it is a great, comfortable, and forgiving top. this top again runs a bit large, so i ordered a size down and it fits great. i think that they are off a bit on their description of the color. i ordered ?pink? but i would consider it more of an orangish red color. not my favorite but not terrible either. overall it is a great shirt.
1756	4	a	The shirt is great, aside from the fact that it runs very large. i ordered an xs when i usually wear a s and it is still very big on me. the color is great though, and the fabric is more comfortable than i expected. i still wear it occasionally with pants or skirts that i can easily tuck it in to.
1757	4	a	This is a beautiful, flattering top that looks great on its own or layered under kimonos or jackets. i bought it in wine and black.
1758	1	a	This dress came with two pieces, a black sheath slip and a sheer pattern top-piece (pictured). it's pull-on and comfortable and flows well. i ordered online but wish i could have selected the pattern, as the fabric differs a little from front to back both in the pattern and intensity of color. overall though, a comfortable, light summer dress.
1759	0	a	I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material, yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7, 130 pounds, athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans.
1760	4	a	I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i can't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.
1761	1	a	"I got the dress with the boat pattern- such a fun dress and very flattering. it is definitely a coral, but i am able to wear this with my fair skin and will probably look better with some color as spring/summer finally arrive. i am only 5""2' so the length is great for me- i can wear this to work, but it would be pretty short for a tall gal. definitely recommend!"
1762	0	a	Love this sweater skirt by tracy reese. i'm a huge fan of tracy reese clothing and this skirt doesn't disappoint. super comfortable. the colors in the skirt are amazing too. many different colors to pull from. i can see myself dressing this up or dressing it down with flat boots and a denim jacket. i felt it fit tts. i usually wear a small in retailer skirts that aren't numeric sizes. got this one in small.
1763	4	a	"I love this shirt! it's gorgeous! got it last night, wore it today, and received compliments all day long.  i don't normally look good in tunic length tops, but somehow there's magic in this one. the seaming on the front totally hides my post-baby pooch. too bad the baby just turned 3 and my pooch isn't going anywhere ...!  adore."
1764	1	a	I was able to try this on in store thanks to a return. it is a cool looking item and i thought the fit and aesthetic were spot on but the price made me leave it behind. even on sale, i this wasn't worth the price for me- the high-low hem and material combined exclude it as a work option for me. if this is something you can get mileage out of, i really do recommend it- well made, lovely colors, and nice style.
1765	4	a	"I am 5'5"", 145 lbs, a cup. depending on the style of the shirt i am between a medium and a small at retailer, in this case i purchased a small. even in the small the body has ample space which adds to the relax look without appearing sloppy. and because the shirt is wider i would say you can easily size down. the shirt is definitely flirty and fun with a great print, and easy to wear off of the shoulders. i invested in another retailer top that is also an ""off of the shoulder"" design but it does not"
1766	4	a	Love this top...bought in 2 colors...white and the orange. fun change to regular t-shirts....sized down because its flowy.
1767	2	a	I love this tunic. i am typically an xxs petite, so i should have known that the regular xs would be too large, but i took a chance on it. unfortunately it was, in fact, much too large. it is too bad because i absolutely love it. the fabric is soooo soft and comfy. i ordered it in the blue, and it is prettier than pictured. this is a great dress for the beach or pool-side or just knocking around. if you live in a hot climate or take warm-weather vacations, i highly recommend this. it takes up ve
1768	2	a	This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat
1769	0	a	I knew from previous pilcro purchases to size down. went down 2 sizes and they fit perfect. this dark wash doesn't have as much stretch as some do which i prefer because they stay up all day.
1770	5	a	"I love the style and look oft this blouse but the fit is a bit off for me. i'm usually either a l or xl. i don't think it came in an xl so i decided to give the l a shot. i would say it runs roomy except through the arms. i found the arms to run strangely tight...and it's not an area i usually have a problem with. the body skimmed nicely over my trouble spots (middle). i found the neckline very flattering and it laid nicely over by dd bust. the v is deep but you don't feel overexposed.   the b"
1771	4	a	"I love the idea of this coat and foolishly purchased other items in happy anticipation of its arrival.  the description does not say ""lined,"" and i hoped for soft wool that i recently got on the ""yellow with white piping"" sweater coat. this is hard, coarse, itchy wool - impossible for me to wear an unlined garment. i am consistently puzzled by the high prices for garments that are unlined when they really need to be. it went back, and i cannot really recommend this as i know i am not the only"
1772	4	a	I bought the white tee. while the print is nice, the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).
1773	0	a	More of a legging than a true pant. fits really well. grey color is great and will go with lots of things.
1774	4	a	"This shirt is adorable. but...it didn't work for me! i'm a smaller gal with a large chest (5'4"", 34g). i tried on the small, since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight, yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much, making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back, and i would have been in love. love the blue color!"
1775	4	a	"I was so happy to discover that my size (00 petite) had suddenly become available again online--probably someone's return. and i wasn't disappointed when i tried the tunic on--it fit great (unlike other recent online purchases from retailer.) love the plaid and the style. the cut should flatter many body types. definitely worth the money!  please, retailer, expand your inventory in petite sizes. the cute stuff sells out so quickly."
1776	3	a	This coat is truly gorgeous in person. it's an investment coat, one that i will probably wear for years to come because the style is timeless and the color is lovely. i found it to be very high quality. in fact, i would love to see more coats of this caliber from retailer. the other reviews had me hesitant to splurge on it, but i don't plan on wearing it buttoned very often so that will be a non-issue for me. the lining is one of the best parts of the coat! show it off! i think the problem
1777	4	a	I'm so glad i bought this. the picture doesn't do it justice. it's lightweight, flowy and super comfy. i'll be wearing this all the time. very lightweight so it doesn't get hot. love the material, it's soft, light and flattering! color says light grey but it does have a bit of a blue/lavender hue to it as another reviewer said. i love cloth & stone and this is one of my favorites! well worth the money!
1778	4	a	"I took the advice of the other reviewer and ordered a medium in this (32d, 31"" waist, 38.5"" hips) instead of my usual small. it fits perfectly--a tiny bit loose like on the model. i bought the beige. you need a camisole underneath but the layered effect is very pretty. it is a delicate material which is why i gave it 4 stars. i can't speak to the quality of it, but will definitely use a hand wash cycle and line dry it. very pleased."
1779	0	a	"These pants are amazing! i love that they zip in the back and the material is just right. i am 5'7"" and they are the perfect length. i bought the black and now buying the gray. i hope they come out with more colors!!!"
1780	4	a	This top is lovely; great colors for spring, light material, flow-y, and the cinching below the bust line creates a super flattering silhouette. i did have to size up to a 2 (i'm almost always a 0) to make some room for the girls (i'm a 32 c/d depending on the brand), so larger chested women may want to size up, but it's well worth it
1781	1	a	Unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle). also, there are no bra-straps holders, and my bra straps did show up a lot...
1782	1	a	I love the cut of this dress, and i'm rather short. i don't think you need to be tall. it's a nice, light fabric that will work well for warm weather. it did wrinkle quite a bit during the day, but never looked messy. i certainly wouldn't describe it as frumpy. it has a nice, loose, 1920s feel, and you can tighten the belt to make it more fitted through the waist. the belt is sewn on in the back, so you can't take it off without quite a bit of tailoring. i had no trouble with the bust being too
1783	1	a	I was so excited to purchase this dress for my masters graduation party. it looks beautiful on but i could not get over one little detail. the structure of the top falls funny on your chest - a bit too high from the rest of the pulled fabric. it doesn't look right. if you have a necklace that falls perfectly on the piece of fabric, like the main photo shown, you are good. the third photo with the short necklace shows this issue best.
1784	1	a	I initially bought this dress to wear to an interview that required something casual, yet could be dressed up with interesting jewelry. although i ended up wearing another black dress, i kept this.  paired with interesting black booties and a great necklace, this dress is easy to wear  - and stylish. most importantly, comfortable. i could see myself wearing this on days that i feel inspired to dress up, but want to wear something that is not fussy. and, the pockets!
1785	0	a	Love the look, beautiful color, great length.  but with many of retailer's lace skirts, dresses and shirts the zipper did not eat to cooperate.
1786	1	a	"I ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed. as other reviewers have mentioned, the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures. the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person.  as for sizing, i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers' comments about it running small. the 2p fit me fine, although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested #32b#. i can definitely see that being an issue"
1787	5	a	Received this yesterday, wearing it today and am happy.  it&#39;s warm and cozy - perfect blend of sweatshirt and sweater for when you want to be comfortable, yet still look like you tried. i&#39;m 5&#39;4.5&quot; and 130 lbs. i ordered an xs and it&#39;s still pretty roomy which is how i think it&#39;s supposed to fit. i would prefer it to be a little more form fitting, but not enough to send back.  great with skinny jeans and boots.
1788	1	a	This is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk. i received many compliments when i wore this, with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry. the fit is true to size, i took my usual size l. it is longer on me than the model, and my only complaint is the slip-it is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together, so i had to find a different slip. i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer, i don't
1789	4	a	I love this top. it is comfortable and different from other tops in my closet!
1790	3	a	I love layering this over basic tees (or graphic ones like the wild west tee) - it adds just the right amount of edge. currently building my pin collection to add on (vintage turquoise and rock music to be exact).
1791	1	a	"I absolutely love this dress! it hugs your body without being clingy - very flattering. the fabric is so soft. i am 5'7"" - 120 lbs - and i usually take an xs or s - i got a m in this dress because of the style and fit and it was perfect."
1792	4	a	Purchased this in two colors online. purchased in an xs - i am usually a s or xs. the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering. returning both.
1793	1	a	Love this dress! purchased it online, the xl sizes can be difficult to find in the store. dress is very cute on and you don't need to be reed thin like the model. it flatters the figure and yes, i wore spank with it. the length is good, the design (black and neutral) is flattering. i chose this to wear to my husband's christmas office party (his new job)! you know first impressions; i did not want to be over dressed. i wore my antho black boots which lace in back and go over the knee- (slouch a
1794	4	a	The models pose and description are misleading. this top has absolutely no shape to it. the front of the shirt is kind of like a slub shirt texture, plain black. the back print is nice,just more faded than shown in picture. the entire design has no form. it is huge. also cheaply made.
1795	4	a	This is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way. this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i can't wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots. it's not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well. love it.
1796	0	a	I ordered the petites hoping the length would fits ankle length but htey do go all the way down. on a muscular bottom/thighs, these a snug, on the model they look loose, but i still do like them. to wear with longer tops... i ordered 25p for 115lbs.
1797	4	a	This shirt has beautiful coloring but the material wasn't as soft as i thought it would be. i was hoping they would be the super soft material, maybe washing them would help, but i didn't want to chance it so i returned them.
1798	4	a	This is one of my favorite tops! i have it in two colors. it's almost like a swing look, yet it still feels like it gives me a shape to my body. very easily paired with a skinny jean. i paid full price for th two, but now i'm sure i'll buy the third on sale!
1799	0	a	"Can't say enough about these pants. i often find leggings to be to revealing when wearing them with long but not long enough top. i have a longer torso so finding tops that hit this sweet spot is an issue for me. i also don't love long flowy tops with jeans all the time. the portions look all off and i look and feel heavy in my middle section. cue these darlings! with out any buttons, zippers on the front your shirts will lay flat and crisp. i feel comfortable and appropriate at my causal work o"
1800	4	a	Comfortable, thick material ( think: structured sweatshirt material) easy to throw on and look as if effort was made - when it wasn't. sizing. i'm between a large and xl usually. large was perfect. i'm tall and curvy: ( 36g curvy) and this cardigan/ belted jacket/is very flattering.
1801	1	a	This pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin. i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool doesn't bother me too much. i'm not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress, even with the slip, which doesn't cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off. i decided to keep and wear as an autumn/winter dress in which i will remove the slip, wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea
1802	4	a	I really like the sundry brand. however. this is thin and to me out of character for an retailer tee. it look adorable in picture. however the coloring is way off. the navy is almost black it's so dark and the kaki stripe is a green. it's nothing like i had hoped it would be. fabric in very thin and more like a pajama top. so disappointed. it will go back. i do not make it a habit to bash a product. however with tax, shipping and 83.00 price tag. 103.11 is absolutely terrible.
1803	0	a	I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable. the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy. i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too. they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer. these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear.
1804	0	a	Love the high waist, prewashed softness, and relaxed fit. i normally wear a 27 in pilcro but sized down to a 26. for the first time in ages i have a pair of jeans that won's slide down because of the high waistline. i would never tuck anything in so it doesn't matter that it's high waisted but i don't have to worry about them sliding down over my muffin top. worth every penny.
1805	1	a	This dress is so beautiful it makes me feel like a goddess, lol. i'm normally a 10/12 or m/l and took a 12. i think the 10 would have worked too. everything from the colors, fit and flow of the dress is wonderful. i didn't have any problem with there being too much fabric as some of the reviews mentioned.
1806	0	a	These pants are so soft and so comfortable! i was absolutely in love at first sight. however, i got the petite, because i am 5'3, and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be. i wanted them to hit right above the ankle, just like the photo, however, they are a tad longer. i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever, so i am gonna deal with the length!!
1807	4	a	"Runs true to size but some details were not as expected. the slit is only on one side and the look is more like sweater dress than sweater tunic. the length is not as long as pictured on the model. i'm 5'7 and the sweater ends half an inch below knees. the side slit starts too high, my waist is exposed unless i wear high waisted leggings. other than that the sweater is darling. the cotton (68%) and acrylic (32%) thread is soft and thin, not bulky at all. the sweater stretches lightly with wear a"
1808	4	a	Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large, but lean towards xl when things don't have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn't squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn't want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far, i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos, the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he
1809	1	a	I absolutely love this dress! i got it right after my first baby was born to wear to an outdoor, early october wedding. it was perfect! the fit is flattering and the dress is well made. it's a classy, elegant dress and i have worn it many times since.
1810	1	a	Just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite. the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero, it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift. and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely. i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting. i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this, but mind the size of the slip in the petites range, and also it is aqua.
1811	4	a	Love this top so much that i bought it in both colors. the fabric is wonderful and the pleated front is a nice feature. i also like the fabric covered buttons. you can button this top all the way or leave the top few buttons undone. either way, it looks cute. i especially like that it looks great under a blazer or cardigan and will look good uncovered when the weather heats up. great quality and features for the price.
1812	5	a	This is such a fun dress to wear. i wanted something comfortable and flirty and this checked off both boxes. im typically a small size 6 but went w x-small on this one to hug the shoulders more.
1813	0	a	I bought this skirt in the blue motif in my usual size large. it is very comfortable, light and it is lined! i wore it with a navy cotton lace meadow rue top from last year, gold gladiator sandals and a long gold retailer necklace.
1814	2	a	Such a cute pattern, and i loved the fold-over design, but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms, and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband, but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent
1815	5	a	"I was very hesitant about this. i read the previous reviews and thought oh no. the first time i saw it in person i was mildly disappointed because the material wasn't how i thought it would be. then i saw it up close, and i realized it was better than i thought. however, i didn't have time to try it on.  it wasn't until later when i saw it on someone else that i realized i was looking at a must have. i am so happy i purchased this. its beautiful and flattering and the colors are bright yet und"
1816	4	a	Detailed beading was beautiful. it's too boxy, way to much fabric in the waist/bust and tight on the hips. it doesn't fall boxy/boyfriend like. the grey fabric is not soft and is lighter in color than the picture. was hoping this would be my go to sweater for warmth on casual days-bummed.
1817	4	a	"I love the color and textures of this jacket. the shawl color adds interest while being cozy and fun. wish it ran a tad longer. otherwise a great mix and match piece."
1818	2	a	Very poorly made- wide and short, very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton, but it felt very synthetic.
1819	4	a	So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos.
1820	4	a	I bought this blouse in two different colors -- the orange and ivory -- and kept the orange. the style and fit were very flattering. the drape of the fabric, along with length (hitting right below waist) and sleeves are very flattering. i am 5'4'' and 118lbs and the 0 fit me perfectly. i have muscular arms and the capped sleeves are perfect. i returned the ivory due to the sheerness of the fabric. it is quite sheer, which is a problem if i wanted to wear this for work. also, you can see the dark
1821	1	a	"I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on. it doesn't look nearly as good on the hanger, so definitely worth trying on. the fabric is high quality and super comfy; the fit is very flattering. i am curvy, 5'7"" and got the navy stripe print in size small. it's very forgiving, fitted without clinging to any ""problem"" areas. i also love how versatile it is--you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models, or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings. love it!"
1822	1	a	Very cute and comfortable dress. run true to size. i usually wear a 4 and the s fits nicely. stretchy and soft!
1823	4	a	"I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3"" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p"
1824	4	a	"I bought the orange in xxs petite, and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs.  i like a swing style, but this is a tent. the material in the cream is fairly sheer, and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams. the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric. they rather skew old school maternity in summation. mine are going back."
1825	4	a	I cannot believe how different this top looks in person. i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately. viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice. it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women. the cut is not too low and lays beautifully.
1826	0	a	I love these cords! soft and great fit. bought three colors!
1827	4	a	This cute top fits great. it's got a nice fit on arms, shoulders, and bust, then flares out a bit to give ease to the tummy area. the back has a cute button trim and solid blue inset. cute top!
1828	4	a	Now i would've been scared off by the fabrics had i not seen the cute, flattering cut if this spring top. love the futuristic look of the fabric and style brought back by the rise design throughout. like the previous reviewer claims, this top is even cuter on us non models (who are pry not as washed out). the color combo is another positive because it's both flattering and versatile!
1829	4	a	It's very beautifully designed, simple but elegant. material is thick and soft so it makes good shape. color is a little different from picture but it didn't disappoint me because everything else is so good.
1830	1	a	This dress is incredible. i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it! i bought it in the navy color, it's gorgeous in person, very bright, vibrant colors. i am 5'9 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist. i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out, and got it taken in a bit. i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads, if you're thinking about buying this dress, do it, you won't regret it!
1831	4	a	I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately, this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big, it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump, but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it.
1832	1	a	I fell in love with the dress when i saw it but i was worried about a few things before ordering it. one comment mentioned that the slip underneath was tight in the hips, yet as a size 30 in pants the slip was still fine. the other concern was the length. i was worried that the dress would be very short compared to my height, however, it was a good length in the front and the back was came down longer than the front which helped the overall length. overall, i ordered a size 6 and it fit well in
1833	4	a	I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment, it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.
1834	4	a	This sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall. wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters. love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho. true to size, great color. lot's of compliments.
1835	1	a	This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me, the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.
1836	4	a	Loved the color and looked super cute in the photo but when i got it home it was way too big in chest area, waist area & too wide at bottom. i'm pretty small but i'm not sure what the right body shape would be for this.
1837	2	a	Perfect substitute for leggings to wear with a long shirt skirts or shorts. and are thick enough to keep you warm and aren't as thin as some tights normally are.
1838	1	a	"Regretfully, this dress is on its way back for an exchange. the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size, i ordered it in both colors, however, the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress, and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom. again, the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching, pulls , or tears for an exchange, but i can't pay 130"" for a dress that is already torn."
1839	4	a	I like this top a lot, and have always liked knotted looks around the bust area. i do not have a large chest, and this kind of top always draws attention in all the right places. i was worried the cut would be too low for my comfort level-and it is low but the shirt does not come away from my body in normal movements so i do feel completely comfortable wearing this without a cami underneath. i don't prefer this in black because i think the color detracts from the bunches of fabric created by the
1840	0	a	They are beautiful in person, until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist, roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather, especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams, is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.
1841	4	a	I expected better from this top, it is thin, will snack easy, and you have to wear a cami underneath. for the price, not worth it. definitely returned!
1842	0	a	"I tried this jumpsuit on in the store and loved it but decided to wait on purchasing it. after it went on sale i jumped on it because i new i would regret not buying it.   i am tall but most of my height is from my long legs, not in my torso. i seldom find jumpsuits that fit my frame but his one fits perfectly. the fabric is very ""flowey"" and does not wrinkle. the overall design of this jumpsuit is slightly but not overly baggy. the pattern and pleating make it a perfect item for spring and su"
1843	4	a	The quality of this blouse is great. a bit on the thick side which i like. the fronts a bit shorter than the back. looks great with joggers or jeans. great neckline and design. i bought this in black and wore it with camo pants and sandals. love it!
1844	2	a	I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4, 155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me, with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person, like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer, so you would need to wear a slip, and the elastic waist still has somewhat of
1845	4	a	So this is still a pretty cute shirt, but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective, just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front, as that is what caught my eye.
1846	1	a	I originally ordered this in green, and unlike another reviewer, i thought the color was perfect for spring. it is trendy, flattering and fun in green, but perhaps not a color i would wear long-term, so i decided to return it and order it in red and black. i also noted the boxy cut, and if that is what you want, it runs true to size. however, if, like me, you want something a little more form fitting, consider ordering down a size or two (depending on your chest size,) and just carefully shimmy
1847	4	a	I saw this top on a store mannikin and was drawn to it by it's color and print. it looked great with blue jeans on display and a lariat necklace. then i noticed the different design on the back below the yoke. the surprise was its being pleated into very fine pleats. i liked the funky quality this added. the design is a good transitional piece to wear early fall or under a jacket. it is machine washable and that finalized the purchase of it. i bought the necklace too. i often wear a small but go
1848	4	a	Cute shirt, great for a lazy day off. i got an xs, but i thought this was a bit lose especially around the waist. the shirt is good quality, the material is heavier, great for spring/fall. it goes well with leggings and a jacket.
1849	4	a	Love the feel and comfort
1850	0	a	Worth every penny. i sized down one size and they look amazing.
1851	1	a	The fit on this dress is super flattering! i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one. i am definitely a pear shape, bigger on the bottom than the top. one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top. this is not often the case. i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it. i also love the colors. i bought the green and blue. i have worn it once
1852	2	a	This bra is beautiful. the lace is so lovely and soft and looks fabulous on. my only criticism is it runs very small. i am a 32 a and order the size 1 and it is snug... just order a size up (or two) and it should be perfect.
1853	4	a	The blouse looked better on the model. i liked the way it fit, just not how it looks. the fabric made me itch, which was one of the other reasons i returned it. i wished it had looked good and the fabric didn't make me itch. i really liked the unique look to the shirt.
1854	1	a	"I am not a model shape but this dress looked so light and beautiful i had to try it. it wasn't available in my local store so i risked it and ordered online. i'm 5'6"" and about 175 lbs; the medium fits perfectly. i will say that the skirt fabric comes much more sharply pleated than it looks in the photos, maybe this hangs out/mellows over time. the lining to the knee is going to be great for warm summer days. can wear to work with a shrug and some flats or to a summer wedding. the pattern is bea"
1855	4	a	"I ordered this online, with a little hesitation due to the negative reviews. it arrived and it is beautiful! the beading and subtle cut outs are gorgeous. the colors of the beadwork in contrast to the nude tone of the fabric is stunning and elegant.! the fit is very very flattering!!!!! runs very true to size."
1856	2	a	I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered, but just decided to return. it runs big and from the front it looks good, but the back just looked like a big oversized, stretched out tank. it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing. so if you're tall, go for it!!
1857	4	a	As all the reviews say it is completely sheer. it's a very cute top other than that.
1858	2	a	Really love this bathing suit. it fits very well, definitely don't need to size up for this one. flattering to my mom-bod and breasts that have seen perkier days. excited to be taking this one to costa rica with me this summer!
1859	4	a	I can't believe these aren't sold out yet.  i had no problem getting this over my head.  this top has such beautiful colors and embroidery.  quality is good.  flattering on.  at this price, it is probably the best deal i've gotten on anything from retailer.  i would recommend this top, absolutely!
1860	4	a	This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color, it looked as if i'd washed it in filthy water. it's a very dingy white, needless to say it went back.
1861	0	a	The color of these shorts is even more beautiful and vibrant in real life. the detail is wonderful and they are so comfortable!
1862	4	a	Saw this in the store but didn't have my size. ordered online- wore it twice already and got so many compliments! very current and flattering!
1863	4	a	Beautiful blend of colors and the texture of the shirt is so soft...perfect fall weather garment!
1864	4	a	"I tried this top in both colors. for the black, the lining looks much more peach in person. the main issue though is the diagonal line that runs through the middle of the top. you can see it in the picture, but is much more pronounced in person. it appears to be where 2 pieces of lace are sewed together and it just looks sloppy.  the line is much less obvious in the navy, and looks much more seamless, perhaps because there is a transition between two colors of lace. the black lining is completel"
1865	1	a	"This is a fantastic maxi -- it is very flattering, you can wear a normal bra with it (for me, very necessary) and the added ruffle makes it perfect. its a casual fabric but because of the contrast in fabric can be dressed up easily.   i am 5 foot 1, 123, and curvy on top and ordered a small petite. in many antrho maxis i go down to an xs, but in this one the small felt the best -- more comfortable around the waist.   will get tons of wear out of this -- have already taken it on a trip and wo"
1866	0	a	Corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit well....even with stretch added. so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif mid-rise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great! they were long enough as well. i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived, it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones. how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well. these are not old lady pants either...how nice!
1867	4	a	I loved the dog on this sweater, and i rushed into the store to buy it. once i tried it on, like others, i did find it to be itchy, but that i could deal with using a tank or something. what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut. my arms looked much bigger than they are, so sadly i left it at the store. it really is a cute sweater though...
1868	1	a	I'll start by saying, over the years, i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap, cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean, this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.
1869	0	a	"I agree with the other reviewer: the snaps at the ankle are a cute idea, but bad in execution. they look and feel odd when on. ---------- these fit tts, and they are soft with decent stretch. but the rise is much lower on me than other 8.5"" rise jeans i have; as a 43 year-old woman they seemed inappropriately low-hanging on me. ---------- as an aside, these will def. color transfer - there is a whole lotta rinse on these. and they have a strange chemical smell to them; not sure if that will diss"
1870	1	a	I was so excited to get this dress. i saw someone try it on in the store and waited all season for it to go on sale. i loved it except for the seam that was right at the neckline in the front. they didn't even try to match up the fabrics. it was so obvious and cheap looking that i had to send this dress back. so sad!
1871	0	a	I ordered my usual size; however when it arrived it appeared to fit a 9 year old! the color and style are adorable. i will need to exchange it for 2 sizes larger! i am so shocked at maeve's sizing.
1872	3	a	I love this vest, good denim quality
1873	1	a	"Dress just arrived and i was a bit nervous of the fit based on the other six reviewers stating it runs small. i actually found it to run exactly true to size. i'm 5'6"" 38-26-38 slender, and on average i wear a size 6, which is what i ordered - 6 regular and it fits as though it was custom made for me. this dress is made very well - looks tailored and hits me right above the knee similar to the model. i feel i scored big by purchasing it at the sale price."
1874	4	a	I like this top because it covers the bum.  it is a little longer in the back than front.  it is cotton modal soft, and it is light enough for summer.  the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail. i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer, but classier than a tank top.  i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter.  i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility, material (for comfort), and classical style.
1875	4	a	To my surprise this sweater is heavy, chic and stylish. its well made and fits tts. i'm looking forward to wearing it. i would recommend this tunic to everyone. it looks better on me than the model.....event though it doesn't look bad. you need curves to enhance the look of this tunic sweater. i really like all the different textures in this sweater.
1876	4	a	Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing.
1877	4	a	"I saw a sales associate (sa) wearing it at my local retailer and totally loved it. this t-shirt runs very large, so it depends on how one wants to wear it. the sa wore it oversized and tied to the side, super cute. i tried on a regular small and it was still 2 sizes too big and too long on me. i ordered the xs petite and it fits perfectly, not too fitted and not too loose (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). my mother was a great embroider and the ""giddy up"" embroidery work at the neckline and the"
1878	4	a	Yes, it runs very large. i usually wear a m and ordered the xs/s. i like the oversize fit and i think this poncho is unique, chic and modern. definitely worth the price, especially on sale. very nice quality fabric.
1879	1	a	Love this dress!!! i agree with the other reviewers, i had to size up one size, but then it was perfect. i'm 5'5, 125 lbs. and the size 6 worked great.
1880	1	a	It's a casual dress with a luxurious feel. very flowy, but the back panel gives it a bit more structure. i like that it graces my body without showing any lumps. i will very much appreciate it on hot days! i'm anticipating a big of headache when ironing it, but i appreciate that it's not dry clean only. i'm on the shorter side of average height and it hits me mid-thigh.
1881	1	a	This a great dress! bright colors, soft material and comfortable! the body of the dress is voluminous, so i found it to be a definite swing dress. i can see why it sold out the first time it was offered!
1882	0	a	These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for, and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim, but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse, but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants.
1883	1	a	I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite, i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.
1884	0	a	"I would say the skirt runs two sizes too small. i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews, i purchased a large. i could barely get the skirt over my hips. even if it fit in the waist, it was much too short on me and i'm 5'2"". it's a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween."
1885	3	a	I bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer. store, but, they didn&#39;t have my size.  someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up.  i probably would have bought the xs but, it was gone.  i went with it a little oversized and love it!  great quality and workmanship on the embroidery.   more like the items that retailer used to sell in 2004 and 2005!  super cute, love it!
1886	4	a	"I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a ""t"". it's soft, pretty and covers my wide bottom well."
1887	4	a	This is a great top and it fit me very nicely but it's much longer than it appear to be in the picture. i'm 5'2 and it was more like a tunic than a tank on me. if it were shorter it would be one of my favorite staples i'm sure. if you're very tall i think you will love it.
1888	0	a	I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper, etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.
1889	0	a	I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice, but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.
1890	4	a	So comfy and stylish. love the color, i purchased the indigo/blue. nice fit, relaxed fit....not fitted. might have to get another color. it's fun to have a tee with a different design detail (neckline). i'm 5'7 145-150 lbs and ordered the medium. a smaill probably would have worked too, since my shoulders are a bit narrow. but mediumd is fine:)
1891	0	a	"Thank goodness chinos are in this year. i was so excited when i saw these pants, and they did not disappoint when i put them on. the material is so soft with a decent amount of stretch in them, making them incredibly comfy. they fit true to size and are very flattering - not too baggy or frumpy looking. i purchased the rose colored pants, which are basically a light nantucket red color. for reference, i am 5'8"" and ~135/40 lbs and bought a size 28. i'd be very surprised if i don't end up purchas"
1892	1	a	Pretty, easy-to-wear dress. loose fitting. i am typically a size 4, size 4 fit, but i might have been able to go to a size 2 if i wanted it to be more fitted at the chest/arms.
1893	4	a	This sweater is very pretty. i had my concerns being that i don't normally pay $300.00 for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece. i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was. this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come.
1894	3	a	I love this jacket! it is super soft and a gorgeous color. i can wear it with jeans and a tee or dress it up and wear it to work. so versatile! a must have for the fall season!
1895	4	a	"Bought this top on a whim on a tops sale and am really glad i did. it's a nice two-in-one piece that can be dressed up for the office with a blazer or down with jeans and a sweater. striped portion of the shirt is a ponte stretchy material. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the small was perfect and even roomy (i don't like things too tight)."
1896	2	a	Great weekend toss around piece or with gym clothes.  the cut is flattering, yet not tight.  i purchased in 2 colos  b/c i liked it so much and was looking for a piece like this for a very long time! cute with yoga legging, jeans, sweats etc.
1897	1	a	This is a beautiful piece. the fabric is a nice weight and the cut of the lace across the shoulders is flattering. the sleeves are dramatic, but not overly fussy. sadly i returned the dress because although it is a swing style (no waistline), it has a very straight cut. i was hoping it was more of an a-line silhouette to accommodate my hips, but alas. if you self-identify as a pear, this may not be the dress for you.
1898	1	a	Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico, but didn't fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time.
1899	4	a	Cozy and nice quality. great fit and runs true to size. could wear this every day
1900	4	a	"I'm in love with this top! i usually wear a s/m or 6, and the size 6 fits perfectly. the cut is very flattering and i love that the sleeves can be worn rolled up and buttoned or down (and when they're down they hit right at the wrist, not too long or short). it's lightweight and comfy, but looks really pulled together. i can see myself wearing this both with ripped boyfriend jeans and sneakers and with dress pants and a blazer. a great transitional piece.  i only wish this came in solid white (o"
1901	1	a	I have an hourglass shape and this dress is a good fit. i think this dress looks better in person than it does in pictures. however, i'm concerned about washing it with that stark fabric and color change.
1902	0	a	When i got this skirt i figured it was a muted sweater skirt. what i got was a much fancier sparkly sweater skirt. the blue is more of a bright sparkly teal and gold thread is woven throughout. oh my it's spectacular. really beautiful.
1903	4	a	I love this top and cannot wait to wear it. the material is a nice weight, the color is pretty, and the fit is very flattering and comfortable. be aware that it does have an elastic waist and the design is very delicately sewn and could tear easily.
1904	2	a	Love these-although i'm exchanging mine for a size larger. they are definitely wide leg, have plenty of length (i'm 5'6, and there is a good inch of extra length), but i found the waist band to fit snug without a ton of give. i also am working off extra baby weight in the stomach/hip area though, but thought it was worth mentioning. i'm pretty curvey, probably a size 31 in jeans right now, and exchanged a l for a xl. great quality
1905	4	a	"This fits me more like a tunic so i wear it with jeggings. i am 5'4 and usually a 10-12 petite and the s fit well. the arms are stretchy which i like since i have an athletic build. love the butterfly pattern !"
1906	1	a	Love this dress. i bought is for a tropic vacation my husband and i went on and it was great. i got so many compliments while wearing it, and it was comfortable! dress is a little roomy in the top, but not enough to prevent me from wearing it. i ordered a medium.
1907	4	a	Got a ton of compliments.  great tee with beautiful print.
1908	1	a	"This is a beautiful dress. it fits true to size. i have some issues around the middle and this just flows away from the body. i am 5'5"" and it falls to the knee on me, longer than pictured on the model. the fabric is a nice weight that can be worn three seasons. the print is pretty and romantic. i'm planning to wear this to my daughter's very informal wedding and know i'll be comfortable and look put together. this was a lucky find!"
1909	4	a	Great addition to my cold weather wardrobe! comfortable and has the slouchy look, but still nice enough to wear to work.
1910	1	a	I love the dress as shown in the photo. thankfully i had a chance to see the dress in the store. it is sheer. can see thru it. can not wear this to work.
1911	1	a	I was so excited to see this yellow dress online but was disappointed with the color when it arrived. the yellow us much darker than pictured. i felt the dress ran true to size but if you're short you definitely want to go with petite sizes.
1912	0	a	I saw these in an email and immediately went to the web to look at them. they fit well and have nice slim look. the bottom of the legs seems to fit a little slimmer on me than in the picture, but they aren't too tight.
1913	4	a	"This is such an amazing take on a white blouse. it's fun and still polished! the fabric is so soft and so easy to dress up or down!  the arm holes run a little small but the cut of everything else is amazing."
1914	1	a	"I bought this dress in ivory and then bought the navy on sale, i loved it so much. i'm 5'4"", 117, and the petite medium was perfect. love the kicky flare, and the lining makes it so comfortable. an effortless, fun dress - perfect for hot summer lunch."
1915	4	a	"I love this style. reminds me of what we used to wear back in the 70's. it's very cute, flattering, and material is a high quality. will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans. if you like this ""baby doll"" style, you'll love this."
1916	4	a	Nice shirt that's a little different from the typical. flirty sleeves that move in the wind which is a great look :)
1917	4	a	I am tall and typically wear a size 10/12, so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted. but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a cover-up than a tunic. it fits like a poncho. with my arms at my sides, it fit me similar to the model picture. but if i lift my arms (to use them), then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me. the reason for that is that it doesn't really have sleeves - it's more like hol
1918	1	a	"Stunning, beautiful, elegant, comfortable and all silk!  the print is very mesmerizing, as are all the hemant & nandita pieces i own.  i'm shocked that there aren't more reviews.  i found this fit perfectly on my body, skimming over my flaws and keeping my temperature moderate.  i am 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 and purchased size mp.  please retailer, offer the other versions of this dress as shown on the uk retailer site."
1919	0	a	I don't if it is me, but usually i am a solid size 6, occasionally an 8.  i had to size up to a 10! the wool is very light, and while it is a weird texture, it isn't scratchy. i liked how the skirt was styled at the store...looks better than it does in the photos online.
1920	1	a	This dress by dolan is my go to favorite for work. it gives a polished look with a pair of booties.i purchased it in an xs. i'm 5'1 and c-d cup. fit me perfectly. i can't wait to team it up with a sweater for chillier fall days. you will get a ton of compliments with this dress. love, love , love.
1921	4	a	I ordered one of each color in size xl. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. there's a lot of material so it's flowy. but, it shrunk with air-drying. the colors are very pretty in person. the white is bright. i decided to keep mine even though they're truthfully, unflattering to wear. the way the sleeves are slightly gathered and cut, make my shoulders & arms look huge. i don't have the shape to pull this off. but, for wearing at home in the summer, they're worth having. the m
1922	1	a	Beautiful dress. good quality. tts. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. ordered my small petite. no issues. however, the green is very bright. the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista's apron! it's going back. i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it's a yes.
1923	2	a	"Very comfortable fabric and fits nicely. i am 5'10"" like it states the model is, and it falls shorter on me that viewed, but still looks nice. it will be an easy dress to use for different looks."
1924	1	a	"The model pose does not do this dress justice. it is super flattering, and the fabric is a thick light fabric, can't explain it.. the pattern is simply adorable, i can't figure out why this one is on sale while other colors aren't as in my opinion, this is the nicest one.  fits true to size as in my lower range. i tried on both pettie and regular and went with regular. petite was too short for me. i went with size 0 and am 5'1.5 and weight about 115."
1925	1	a	Got the wine color and love it! the design definitely is slimming! 5'1, 120lb, got  size 4.
1926	4	a	I bought this in navy and love the multi textures and look. i'm happy it was on sale because it is so cute but i would not have paid full price on it. it runs small. i plan on wearing it for casual errand days.
1927	1	a	I wear an xxs petite and this dress was still large. i like that look so i'm okay with that but the sides do stick out a little bit if you have a smaller frame.
1928	1	a	"I'm 5'5"" and got the m. i thought i'd need the petite but i decided to try on the regular m in the store and the length was fine (mid calf). i gave a 3 for quality though because all the ones in my store were tearing in the back where the shoulders meet the back. i bought it anyway because it looked like an easy fix and it was so darn cute and comfortable on!"
1929	4	a	"This sweater coat caught my attention online, so i went in search for it at my local store. it's a flattering fit, across the chest and shoulders. very well made. the length is mid thigh. i am 5'4"" 125lbs. i went with the small, with the thought of wearing nothing too bulky under it. it does have an attached belt, that can easily be knotted together or each on its own for another look, if you opt to leave it open. it's light weight enough for cool days or evenings, but also warm enough for colde"
1930	4	a	Love this top! it has a beautiful appliquã© that is reminiscent of many past retailer favorites. it's comfy, yet cute and fashionable.
1931	4	a	This blouse is not only flattering, but a great way to dress up a pair of jeans! fits well, but a big tight around the arms, had to go up a size.
1932	1	a	As in super comfortable and a joy to wear. i saw it online and then went to the store to try it on. the moment i put it on i knew it was for me. i missed out on getting it in the other color. i hope you get more in other colors!
1933	4	a	Fits and lots nothing like picture. very wide like a tent dress!
1934	1	a	This pajama-like dress is not worth $150 (full price plus tax in texas), so i can't really justify keeping it. i kept having to pull it over on one side so it would align correctly. it also runs big. i bought the m (which i am returning) and it bunches at the waist but the length was perfect. the s is too short on the bottom. i love the color, but it's going back. i'd buy it if it were on sale.
1935	4	a	Got this in the blue/floral and absolutely love it!!
1936	4	a	This top is adorable ,i finally broke down and bought it,so happy i did fits good,not too long sits at hip were it should (very flattering) i went with the reviews and sized up,i am a petite sx normally in retailer,but went with what the reviews said and got a reg small glad i did!it is a bit snug(not tight) in the chest,but has stretch to it , i am 5'1 108 33d (if you are bigger in the chest i would recommend a medium,) i got the purple motif (print) no see thru issues,the material is a comfortab
1937	0	a	Love this skirt! i have worn it to work with a simple black shirt for a great outfit! i have had many compliments on it. it is very flattering and comfortable!
1938	4	a	I fell in love with this top (sweater) before it could even be ordered - was on model for pants that were available to order. in any case, i later ordered the blue motif online and the colors are even more beautiful in person. the blue also contains fibers of wine - so very pretty. the gray is a soft shade. the quality is lovely too. the only cons are that the seater is rather heavy, but should be great for colder winter months and the zipper on the back is quite conspicuous. however, that said,
1939	1	a	"Soft and flowy. fit is great. quality is great. i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well. i haven't worn a dress in 10+ years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first. highly recommend. i paired this with 4"" short black suede boots and black tights. many compliments (even from my husband and he doesn't usually pay much attention)."
1940	1	a	I tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 (a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea). the 4 fit in the outer layer, however as the previous poster mentioned, the lining is super tight. i couldn't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips. the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining. not sure what when wrong here but it's a shame because it's a really cute dress.
1941	0	a	Sporty, comfortable and good option to replace jeans, however material needs to be ironed. i bought these as a nice (dressier) alternative to jeans on my trip to europe but didn't end up wearing them b/c an iron wasn't readily available and the height of my ankle boots made the style look choppy. best to wear these with shoes that don't come above ankle.
1942	4	a	Very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall, 120 lbs. i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top.. sadly returned the top. otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric.
1943	1	a	I love this dress. the pockets are great and the fabric is very soft and similar to other cloth and stone garments. i also love it's made in the usa. my only wish is that the chambray version was as great. (it's not - the pockets are cut bad, it's cut smaller in the chest, and made in china)
1944	4	a	Perfect trans top.  skinnies or boyfriend and booties.  love the mixed prints
1945	4	a	This shirt was a cute print, but it was too boxy and hit too short on the thigh. i considered having it taken in the waist but ultimately decided it wasn't worth paying the extra $ on top of the $88
1946	5	a	"I found this at my local store and ended up buying both colors. the fabric is thicker than a t-shirt. these will go with so many things....jeans to dressy skirts. i normally wear a small but ended up buying the medium (2). the small fit me but was a little too short (for reference i am 5'8""). these will be a staple in my wardrobe all year round. love!"
1947	4	a	This is a gorgeous blouse, but it runs small in my opinion. i consistently wear a size 2 in moulinette soeurs, and i'm trying to decide if a 4 will still be too small, and if i need to exchange for a 6. construction and materials are lovely, just consider sizing up if you purchase this blouse.
1948	4	a	I absolutely adore this shirt, it is such a comfortable material and goes great with a pair of jeans! i love how it fits tightly in the sleeves and flows out at the bottom just the right amount. i highly recommend adding this to your wardrobe.
1949	4	a	"I love the color (mustard) and design of this shirt! however, the description says it's made of cotton and i was disappointed to find when it arrived that it's actually made of 100% modal ? which is a big difference to me. i also think it runs small ? i ordered a medium (5'5"", 125#, 34c), but would have had to order a large if i wanted the look pictured on the model. finally, the modal fabric is quite thin and i don't imagine it'll last too long without tearing. i'll probably keep it because i l"
1950	3	a	"The kimono is as pictured. the colors are true to what is shown on line, though the description indicates ""green multi""--it is not green. i returned the item, however. the quality is fine, but it seemed extremely over-priced to me. it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality."
1951	2	a	Just not cute. i don't know how else to describe this top. i am a 34dd and ordered a large. it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am. i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn't in store so i returned.
1952	0	a	"I am so happy i took a chance on this jumpsuit! i am post-baby (six weeks) and although i intend on slimming down more i would say that it is flattering even at my current size. and it will only get better!  the quality and color are great!"
1953	1	a	"It's a fine dress, but it definitely runs small, and it's actually a lot shorter than i was expecting, especially since i'm only 5' 3"""
1954	0	a	"I bought these pants in red after trying them on in store. they are soft and company. they have a loose fit, which is typical for chinos, so they pair best with a fitted top. i'm 5'2"""" and these were the perfect length when rolled. they run a bit big and stretch out though and eventually were too baggy. i loved them though so i ordered them in a size down. i'd definitely buy them in other colors too if they become available in my size!"
1955	4	a	"Fits true to size! looks great just wish it was a tad longer but i am 5'10"" so..."
1956	1	a	What a perfect summer dress! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it's perfect. the slip is a little snug on the hips, but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger. i can't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer!
1957	4	a	"I had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be. it was tts (i'm 5""3 and usually wear a small). but the material was horribly scratchy. both the body of the top as well as the sleeves. and the design isn't all that flattering. it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life!"
1958	2	a	Looks really nice on teh pictures. i tried on thre cream as this was the only color availalbe at my store (tried on per stylist recommendation(. it is very thin, you can see ripples from my belly lol, but still fairly flattering. i ended up purchasing, but it is in my maybe pile for now... wil lwait before wearing it to be sure. can't wear a grey bar with it, that htin...
1959	4	a	I bought this tee for a light summer top as i love linen. this top does not disappoint. i bought my usual size xs and the length is good-slightly longer in back. i purchased the black and the grey. the grey will be great with jeans in any color and the black i can wear either dressed up or down. the quality seems good. great purchase!
1960	4	a	I made the mistake of ordering a medium instead of large and have the same fit issues as other reviewers. it is tight in the back through the shoulders, so if you're considering it i would stick with your larger of your size range. the print is beautiful as is the fabric. it looked okay on me from the side but i am short waisted. it fell at the perfect length on me too. there's just something about the fit that didn't wow me so i don't plan to reorder, but i do think it would be lovely on thinne
1961	0	a	Perfect fit, great material, torn in just the right places. can't wait to see the stevie jeans for the fall esp. in corduroy!
1962	4	a	This sweater caught my eye while in the store shopping for a gift. i am on the shorter size so i was worried that it would drown me. it didn't! it hits me mid thigh. the sides are cut up high. i will wear a cami or shirt under it. super soft material. flattering fit. i have put on a little weight and this hides all the problem areas without looking frumpy. thanks
1963	1	a	"This dress fits true to sizing for this dress designer (i.e.: a little on the large side as compared to other dressmakers). it is very flattering on and is made of cotton sailcloth, so it is not ""flowy""."
1964	4	a	The wine color is beautiful, and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however, both fabrics are thin, and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so, if you are the quintessential tall and thin, and you don't mind showing your bra, go for it! otherwise, i suggest skipping this one.
1965	4	a	Everyone should have this blouse, amazing! simply love it! it does run large, so purchase down 1-2 sizes.
1966	4	a	I like flowy tops because i have a bit of a belly and i like to camouflage it but this top was really flowy. the fabric is great and the embroidery is beautiful, i was hoping for this to be a holiday staple this year. it has to go back though, just too large. i don't love it quite enough to order a size down.
1967	4	a	I bought this shirt in the teal/navy and loved it so much that i went back and bought the white/navy too. it is so soft! the shirt runs a little tight but is stretchy and not uncomfortable. the sleeve length and neckline dress up this shirt a little bit from being a standard t shirt, yet it is just as comfortable. overall very cute and flattering.
1968	1	a	I love this dress!! it has a beautiful european flair, and more beautiful in person. i don't agree with the other reviewers that its see through-the fabric is a good quality, and thicker than you would think. the variable length is the best part of the dress. the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow!
1969	4	a	This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.
1970	4	a	Classic and stylish. trendy with the blocking...rich colors, soft and comfy. i typically wear s and s was perfect. i love this sweater.
1971	1	a	This dress is a work of art both online and in person. the color is more vibrant in person and both colors are beautiful. i like the mango color better because it looks better on my olive skin tone, plus i like the purple flowers against the orange background. thank goodness for the liner because this dress is very thin. it wrinkles easily but i think it comes with the territory due to the thin silk fabric. for short gals like me, a belt is a must for a structured look if worn with heels; otherw
1972	4	a	This is baggy on me in my regular size. this happens to be a good thing because it's also very thin...tissue thin... material. the reason that's a good thing is i can wear another t- shirt under it with all that extra room and it hangs nicely. i'm hoping it shrinks a bit when i wash it in hot water.the design on the front is the only real reason i'm keeping it.
1973	4	a	I had to keep rechecking the price tag on this one to be sure i saw it correctly. price aside though, it's really awesome. fit is flattering, stripes are cute, colors are nice, and you can wear it all summer long. if you can get over the dollar signs, it's a keeper!
1974	3	a	This is a nice everyday jacket to wear with dresses, jeans, skirts, anything. i ordered the only color that had petite left, the plum. i liked it, but the fit was a little boxy, even as xs petite. length was nice, however. color was also a nice neutral, though it says plum, it is a darker brown. for reference, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs - review on xsp.
1975	4	a	This blouse is very beautiful and flattering. it's just a little bit see through so i will wear a cami underneath. as with sizing i did size up as the other commenters recommended to do so.
1976	4	a	This is going to be my go-to winter sweater for work! this piece is super comfy, yet a bit more dressy than just a regular sweatshirt. it will be an especially great layer for the ups and downs of the office thermostat.
1977	0	a	I am so in love with these pants. i generally stay away from wide legged pants because i think they make me look shorter (i am already short) but these are awesome. the fabric is not very thick so they are moveable which is great, but not so moveable that they feel like palazzo pants-they will hold their shape. i love the polka dot design so much and i actually really love the whole outfit with the black tie-top. these pants are long on me, but it isn't surprising since i am pretty short, i am t
1978	4	a	I love this tee! while it is true to size i feel, it is meant to have a loose fit. that being said, it is a very flattering cut and has a great drape. super comfy, flattering and classic.
1979	4	a	I went to my local retailer store in kansas city,mo at country club plaza and let me tell you when i saw this sweater i mediately fell in love with it. i bought mine in the red color in a size medium and it fit me perfectly. i would definitely recommend getting this sweater because it's so soft and very flattering on my body type. i also love the pattern and definitely worth the money!!
1980	0	a	Great fabric, not too clingy and provides a forgiving sillhoette. very comfortable. perfect skirt for summer get togethers or shopping. may be a little long if you are on the short side. one thing i liked is that the skirt draped well and doesn't hang open or slide up. recommend particularly on sale.
1981	2	a	Possibly my favorite retailer purchase ever! like wearing a cloud & fit perfectly! if you're busty - not sure about it -- but otherwise wow! told my husband: hope you like it because you'll be seeing it all the time & he not only agreed but wanted to know if they made pajamas for men.
1982	4	a	Loved the look, quality was great, but didn't work for me. too busy and off-fitting. i did return.
1983	4	a	The color was a little darker than it looks online, but i like it!
1984	1	a	Kind of excited about this little number. i found it online and was immediately drawn to the boho-chic look. it arrived and i was impressed with the weight of the dress and the detailing that is missed in the photo.
1985	1	a	Got tons of complements and can work for many seasons, just throw a cardigan for fall -runs a little bit and would like if it was touch longer but overall very happy with this find!
1986	5	a	Unusual color. expensive even on sale.
1987	3	a	I agree with the other reviews that the sleeves can be tight even for those with slim arms. life would be great in this coat if my arms were always down by my sides. but when i lift my arms that's another story. i also agree that the material wrinkles easily. this is a high-maintenance item as far as pressing and ironing goes. it is a very pretty feminine coat but i would reconsider this only if it goes on sale.
1988	1	a	"This is a lovely, well-made piece by maeve, a longtime favorite of mine. the material is great weight and won't wrinkle, colors are vibrant, and design of the dress is cute, if a bit on the short side.  however, i, like some of the other reviewers, didn't love this this on me. the waist hit slightly above my natural waist (and i'm very short-waisted) and this particular sweetheart neckline did nothing to flatter my bust (i'm a 34dd for reference). the end result was a bit too dowdy on top with"
1989	0	a	"I have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans, and have loved them all!!! these, unfortunately i do not like. i think they run large and the fit, just blah. the waist gapped and kinda had a ""mom jean"" look. i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand."
1990	4	a	I am not a bright clothing person but adore this top. if this is the right red for you i highly recommend.! it is a beautiful bright red no orange tones so really works with my skin tones. it is a very comfy shirt and although it is a stretchy fabric it did not show any lumps or bumps in the upper back. has a beautiful flow to it and looks not only great with jeans but really cute with a patterned sweater pencil skirt i bought at retailer a couple years ago and always with a good old black pencil
1991	4	a	I love clothing with elements that elevate them from basic to extraordinary. this tops does that for me: the black is a rich dark charcoal grey, the modal fabric blend has a nice feel and drapes well. however, the cut is very body conscious and i found both the medium and large tight in the midriff (my problem) area. since i love it so much, i will keep the medium since the sleeves are looser on the large. it looks exactly as pictured and would fit well on someone with a waistline.
1992	4	a	This is one of the best tops i've ordered. it fits well, it can be worn dressy or casual. what is pictured is what you get. if you are considering this top, it can be worn all year round! the price is not outrageous, and the quality seems it could last for more than one season.
1993	4	a	I love this top. lovely, light, airy material, though i don't think i'll wear a cami under it. i'm usually a small petite so i ordered this in an extra small. i love the way it fits.
1994	3	a	"I'm 5'10"" and felt that it was just too short. otherwise - love it!"
1995	3	a	Ordered this in my typical size, xs, and it fits perfectly. the weather hasn?t cooled off enough for me to wear it on a daily basis, but after just trying it on i can say that it fits really nice. the sleeves are a knit material which make them very forgiving and the jacket easy to wear. plus, there is enough room for me to wear a tee-shirt or thin blouse underneath. ordered the slate color and it is a very beautiful neutral, brown that should go with almost anything.
1996	4	a	"Bought this top in white and blue motif. it fits me great and looks adorable. the only comment is that the holes for the buttons are a little too big but it's an easy fix. this top looks great dressed up or down. would definitely recommend!"
1997	0	a	"This skirt looks very nice in person and it hugs one's cure beautifully. the hem is uneven which makes it more interesting. i am 5'2"", 120lbs, tried it in the navy/beige color in size s and size xs, and i found size xs fits better. the fabric is soft and stretchy, and it drapes well. because i am petite, the length of the normal size fits me more like a maxi skirt (it goes all the way down to my mid calf). unfortunately, the petite xs is sold out, so i have to settle with the normal size xs. sti"
1998	4	a	I really like this top! it's lightweight, great quality, and i've worn it for casual weekend outings and also dressed up for work.
1999	1	a	"The overall color of this dress is more buttery white and the pale golden embroidery almost blends in.therefore i think the dress benefits from being styled . i tried bold colored scarves with fringes and big statement jewelry. this dress is more casual with its fringes , the jeans like material ( although softer than cotton) as well as the loose pullover style. it is easy to dress down with a blue jean jacket, casual sandals or even sneakers.  i have a 38 c chest and the l fits almost too loos"
2000	4	a	This would have been a perfect jacket for a trip i'm taking, light weight and very stylish. however the jacket runs huge, the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big. i wear a size 8-10 mostly 10 in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about 2? past my natural shoulders. i won't return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool (i should have checked) its unbearably itchy esp around the neck, you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it
2001	4	a	I ordered this shirt and was happy to see that it looks just like it does online -- i love the rusty orange and pale blue contrast with the navy. the navy blue underlayer is so flattering, and the sheer sleeves are feminine and lovely. the shape and pattern are forgiving. this brand is really hitting it out of the park these days. this blouse runs a bit smaller than some meadow rue. if you're between sizes (especially arm-wise), i'd order up. otherwise just get your regular size. the body is flo
2002	1	a	The cut, fabric and detail on this dress is incredible. it runs a bit small though, usually i wear a 00p, but the 0p is plenty snug. 5'4'',110lbs,32c, fits just as on the model, looks much like photos, but slightly more yellow in tone.
2003	4	a	I can't believe this top hasn't sold out. it is a great casual top that will go well with anything. i agree with previous reviewer that talked about sizing up to cover straps. i did size up to a large but it didn't get huge around the midsection. i got the red and it will go great with pilcro khakis or denim.
2004	4	a	Love this!!! 115 lbs thin arms, the xs fits perfect. it's very flattering and has a boho vibe bc of its length. the arms are a little snug but in a very flattering way. haven't worn it enough yet to experience any pilling, but crossing my fingers. the cream is a really pretty pale oatmeal color imo. the grey is a black/grey speckled look.
2005	1	a	Such pretty pattern and colors, pleased with dress
2006	4	a	I love this top! i originally bought the brown/purple pattern and wore it all the time so when i saw the blue and yellow on sale i had to get it. the fabric is really soft and breezy - perfect for the spring to summer weather. the sleeves are a little long on me but doesn't bother me. it runs a little large but works with my style. i would have sized down but it wouldn't have fit in the bust (i'm a 36d). i definitely recommend this top!
2007	4	a	"Great sweater - very pretty and warm. i would say it fits true to size, but the fit itself/style is just a little roomier - just like on the model. i usually take an xs and the xs fit great. the tag says to dry clean or hand wash in cold. i always wash my wool sweaters in cold water, in a garment bag, on delicate wash and have never had a problem. but, when i did that for this sweater, it shrunk to a size that would fit a 4 year old. the fabric in the arms stuck together, like velcro. very inter"
2008	1	a	This is a beautiful dress! i bought the red color in petite and love it. i know i will wear it a lot and the style is really easy to wear. i feel amazing in it even tho my post baby body isn't what it was.
2009	4	a	It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester, slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.
2010	4	a	Very cute shirt, well made, nice detail, but a little long for my taste but i did keep it
2011	3	a	I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer, which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however, the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also, the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit, but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).
2012	3	a	I happened upon this in my local store despite the fact that it is an online exclusive. i love finding returns so i can see them in person. i loved the soft colors right away. my hesitation was the standup collar but it actually folds down just fine and gives the vest lapels too. it also looks nice belted, left slightly open. i usually wear small or xs in tops and the small fits nicely. it doesn't need to close since there are no built-in fasteners. i will wear it with a long button down shirt o
2013	4	a	Bought this in green at my local store and fell in love with it! i also tried one in pink and it was a bit sheer which is why i opted for the green color instead. very nice and feminine.
2014	0	a	This skirt is true to size and very comfortable on! the colors are beautiful and deep! so glad i snagged this on sale! it will be a great piece to dress up or down depending on where i am going! love it! get it while you can!
2015	4	a	This top is just adorable. i'm usually between an xs and a small and i went with the small and it's a little more roomy. i wanted it to be long enough. the colors are beautiful and it's a must have.
2016	4	a	I was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party, i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model (i am a more typical 50 year old mom body) and i have never worn a peplum style. i put it on for my husband and approved, so i wore it. i received many compliments - a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my 'comfort zone' with the style!
2017	4	a	This top has a western look with lots of black and some burgundy shades.  it is very cute and the fabric is soft.
2018	4	a	I love this tee, i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal.
2019	4	a	I bought it to mainly wear as a coat but i think it'd be great with some leggings and boots as well. if you want a more structured look go a size smaller. i plan on wearing this more as outer wear so i went with large. the coral is beautiful
2020	0	a	Beautiful piece that i loved from the day i received it in the mail. lots of compliments, just a fun, pretty outfit.
2021	1	a	In retailer dresses the petites usually fit me better, i'm short, but this regular fit well. looks super cute, i've gotten so many compliments on it. comfortable, and the pockets are always nice.
2022	0	a	Tried this soft yummy jumpsuit on and loved the flow and softness of the fabric ...... will be able to wear into the fall with oversized sweater or wrap. just love
2023	4	a	I liked the details on the front a d back of this top. while i was pregnant i purchased the white color in the small. everything fit, suprisingly, the top even covered up my pregnant belly. i returned it since i didn't want a top with so much room in the waist area post pregnancy. i recently got this top in the xs thinking that it will be a great stylish breasting top. while everything fit in the hips, and waist, the chest area was too tight. this top did not work for me as i am in between sizes
2024	4	a	This sweater is so lovely, i bought it first in navy and then came back for it in grey. very soft and comfortable. the back doesn't wrinkle the way you might think it would from the pics alone. very flattering. i highly recommend it!
2025	0	a	I love this skirt!! i'm trying to find the perfect place to wear it :)
2026	4	a	I was eyeing this blouse when the catelog was mailed to me earlier this year. i never got a chance to try it on in stores, but when i saw it online and on sale i snagged it. what i didn't realize was the intricate design of this blouse. ithas really pretty lace all over the top and then fine beading securely sewn on. the blouse has crochet sleeve designs and also a very pretty neck bib area. it fits me tts and very comfortably. i love the airy feeling of it and it actually also isn't too long on
2027	2	a	Super cute, soft, and fuzzy...just like the woodland animals in the pattern. these loungers do run just slightly tight in the seat, so if you have a more developed bottom you should definitely get a size up.
2028	1	a	I am in between sizes (and styles) after having a baby. this dress looks great on my curvy figure and enhances my look with the cinching of the belt and the detail of the flutter sleeves. perfect length and really fits well. i am very happy with it!
2029	1	a	This dress is great! the fit is perfect and very flattering. the two colors and asymmetrical hem on the front make it different than you average sundress. looks great with flip flops, sandals, wedges or booties. will be a great piece for summer but the darker colors also make it the perfect transition to fall dress.
2030	3	a	First saw this jacket in the catalog, in peach, and had to have it. i received it today, and love it. its a soft, muted peach, very neutral. i ordered xl, im usually a m-l, but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy. the quality is great, feels good on. love it so much, i just ordered it in the dark grey. very classic jacket, will wear for years. one of my favorite hei hei pieces, never disappoints.
2031	4	a	Bought in white. it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear.  the white is pretty sheer. will return.
2032	5	a	"This skirt is really adorable, but only if you're going to tuck in your tops. the pockets flare out at the top, so shirts don't lay correctly on them. instead the bottom of the shirt floofs out and looks really dumpy. tucked in though, super cute!  the waist is really tiny and the fabric has no stretch to speak of. i usually take a 0/2 pant or 25/26 jean. i ordered the xsmall and could only get the top fastened by really sucking it in and struggling. i'll be exchanging for a small, hopefully t"
2033	0	a	This is a beautiful skirt. i'm very pleased with the quality. it runs small though, i'm usually size small and went for the medium. i'm 5' 2 and got the regular vs petit, which would have been too short for me to wear at work.
2034	2	a	"This tank is fairly soft and fits true to size. i like that i can pick between a v or round neck, depending on my outfit. it truly offers a profile to layer with anything. the only complaint i have is that the edging wears faster than the rest of the tank. i've trimmed some pilling off of it to keep it looking neat. otherwise, this is one of my favorite tanks, and i have purchase two more so i can always find one when i want it.   this tank has some stretch, so i imagine it fits a range of siz"
2035	4	a	"I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber, which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 5'8"" frame so the shirt tail hems peeked"
2036	0	a	Usually wear stevie jeans from ag but wanted to try something different. now i love farrah!
2037	4	a	"I was worried about ordering this top after the first review, but i was very pleasantly surprised. the sweater is a nice weight on the front panel, and a lighter weight knit on the back panel, which gives it a ""flowy"" quality. it looks slender and trim in front, with the unexpected surprise in back. the transition between the front and back panels is well done, which doesn't really show in the photos. i purchased the yellow sweater and had many compliments on it's uniqueness the first time i wor"
2038	2	a	"This pants are very comfortable, and add a little flare to my typical ""mom pajama"" look. i found them true to size; size small fit my 5'7, 135lbs frame. comfortable to sleep and lounge in!"
2039	0	a	I absolutely loved these pants the first several times i wore them. the fit is flattering, they are a perfect long length, and the colors are stunning. after several wears, it was time to wash them and i followed the directions provided to wash with cold water and line dry. i was initially horrified with the amount that these pants shrunk in fit and length and the colors ran together. after a lengthy ironing session, i was able to smooth out the material and restore much of the length and fit bu
2040	1	a	"I couldn't resist the toucan print when i saw this online, and ordered in my normal size s (27/4 in pants, 34b bust, 5'7""). the fit is perfect - arm holes are an appropriate size (not huge like some dresses), semi-fitted and flattering, nice length for work, and the tie front is a nice detail to help define the waist. length is about the same as the model shot. i knocked off a star for quality since the fabric is not particularly breathable for summer and the zipper is a little tough in the wais"
2041	4	a	Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.
2042	1	a	This is by far one of my favorite dresses i have tried on in a long time. i am a 2-4, the small was tts and so flattering. i think this would be better for someone taller with a lean frame, though its not super tight and the material has a great weight to it, it isn't lined and could definitely show figure flaws. for me it skims my body elegantly and was very comfortable through the bust, waist and hip (34c/26/36). it fits me like the model in the image. the one down side is that it is pullover
2043	1	a	I really loved the pattern and style of this dress! unfortunately, i had to return it because i have broad shoulders and it is a pretty stiff top that cut into the flabby area near my armpits. for most people it's probably perfect! but if you have wide shoulders or any concerns about the armpit flab, this might not be a great choice for you.
2044	1	a	I really love this dress and want to buy it, but i won't buy it in white. it is just too easy to get dirty. i would love a pretty blue or even a darker yellow.
2045	4	a	I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down, but i bought it online, so i just decided to live with it. pretty top, though i do think it runs large.
2046	4	a	I typically wear a medium, but went with a large because i am pregnant and tall. i think i could have used the medium in width, but like the length of the large. it is a wider fit and is significantly shorter in the front than the back, but i think works with the look of the top. i think you could dress it up or down and the fabric is cozy. i would highlight that it has a wider fit, but i think that is the design of the top. overall, i am pleased and i think meets my search for an off the should
2047	0	a	I tried these in store, didn't have much hope as flare usually looks terrible on me (small waist and athletic, fuller legs). but surprisingly these work great. they seem to very good quality and the flare is super cute and on trend. i do think they run a little small. i am almost always a 2/26, but i took these in a 4. they didn't have a 2 in store for me to compare but i think they would have been too tight. highly recommend!
2048	5	a	I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small, but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine, yes, it is a little hard to zip up, but once on, it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i didn't sit and eat... we shall see. i don't plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling
2049	0	a	"I purchased these pants on-line in my usual size petite 4 and they were a perfect fit for me. i have a 27"" waist, 35"" hips and i'm 5'4"" and found them to be a little long but not so much that i want to hem them as i'll be wearing these with my clogs and platforms anyway. if i want to be able to wear them with flats, i'll need to hem them but i bought them to go with my higher shoes so it's no bother. these are very slimming pants and zip up at the back. they are a tad difficult to zip up but not"
2050	0	a	I look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size. for some reason, this fabric isn't working for me. i think it's the sheed combined with the stretch (or lack there of) of the fabric. i'll have to pass.
2051	0	a	This is my 6th pair of rockets. they've become my hands down, favorite cut from citizens. for curvy girls, these are the perfect skinny jeans. they come up high enough to tuck everything in, no muffins top. they shape and lift my butt, which i need because i've got a generous one. they hold their shape amazingly well and don't require a wash with every wear in order to regain their shape. they truly have been the holy grail of jeans, for me. with all that said, these are not a 5 star version of
2052	2	a	These leggings are amazing. by far one of the most comfortable pairs that i own! i should have ordered more. i got a m/l and they fit perfect. the detailing is awesome, and they even stay opaque when you sit, so you don't have to worry about them being see-through. great buy!
2053	0	a	I love these pants so much i had to write a review! purchased the carbon color recently in regular length - the length stated is pretty true and there was minimal shrinkage for me. size was also tts (typically wear size 2 and got 26). i've been wearing them often! they look great right out of the dryer and drape nicely. i've been purchasing the pilcro linen trousers for years but these are my favorites this season --- i also think the quality is much better. i will be getting them in more colors
2054	2	a	"It is hard to believe that this is called a chemise! it is a fabulous dress! this dress caught my eye in the store and i had to try it on. i went with the navy, which is beautiful and has a great pattern. i had to order a petite xs because the regular xs was loose in my shoulder area. i am petite and narrow and 5'1"". the petite xs was perfect for me. it is quite form fitting and does show curves, lumps and bumps so i wore my dress with spanx tights. it was such an easy dress to wear, looked styl"
2055	1	a	Love the way this feels ? epic and flowy and flattering ? and features my shoulders and de-emphasizes shape and size from waist down. waited for it to go on sale and it paid off. i'm wearing it to a wedding this weekend. i can't wait to show it off! highly recommended.
2056	4	a	Super cute basic top but after washing it once according to tag instructions, it is pilling like a well-worn sweater would.
2057	0	a	"First let me say that i've recently fallen in love with the pilcro brand. i love the pilcro hyphen chinos and needed some new shorts for the summer. i have extremely muscular legs and have a hard time finding shorts that look good. i was hesitant to try these on because they said the inseam is 4"" but one other reviewer pointed out that they are a good mid-length if you unroll them, so i just went to try them on at the store, and what do you know? they are exactly that! unrolled, they come about"
2058	3	a	Simple blazer with cute details - buttons on the back and lining. this will look good both in the office over over a pair of jeans and booties. i was able to go with the regular size (instead of petite) because i will wear with the sleeve rolled up.
2059	4	a	"Love this little number. very flattering, warm, and soft. color goes with everything, i tried it on with a slip dress, and it added class and warmth... big button details are fun well-made and beautiful cut. i ordered xxs petite, and it fit like a glove, with room for something underneath if needed. i also ordered te xs petite, as my stylist was afraid xxs would be small, but will keep xxs p after actually trying it on. 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist."
2060	1	a	"What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5'2"", but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i can't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me, so i'll be returning it."
2061	4	a	Hate i have to return it - way too long-almost more mid thigh/almost dress length.
2062	3	a	I was lucky enough to see this in store when it went on sale and although i rarely wear leather/vegan jackets i tried it on. i am torn on sizing i'm normally a m or 8/10 in retailer but the m fit slightly tight in the waist and the l was slightly loose. i ended up with the l in the moss color, since i can layer and don't really want the jacket too cropped. i also saw the brown and tried that on but for me the moss color was much richer.
2063	4	a	My heart's a-flutter for this top. the fabric has an excellent weight and feel to it, and the little, fluttery cap sleeves are to die for. i've ordered this in almost every color because it is such a great staple. it is a gorgeous pairing with the marala knit skirt (especially in green,) and the double stripe jacquard skirt, but i'm certain it would be a perfect choice for any pencil skirt. it's so flattering and comfortable, with a neckline that is perfect for single strand pearls or similar le
2064	4	a	I am writing a review even though this is currently sold out (and was just released). what i love: the fit: snug, not too tight, and xs is true to size in the sense of historically. the wasit is cinched in, ample room in the chest. the fabric is substantial (thick and sturdy) and not prone to wrinkle, based on me having it in the bag in the hot car) and no false pleats was created. the sleeves are fun and different, may be a bit much for some. it is in multiple pieces, why it flutters so nicely.
2065	0	a	Material is kind of thick. stretchy. the orange i ordered was just too bright for me. i'm 8/10 and got the 10. i think the 8 would've worked better. sending back, mostly bc the color didn't look good on me.
2066	0	a	Love the way these pants fit. love the length. love the cut! just the right amount of flare... normally i am a 28 or 29 in citizens jeans. i considered the 27 in them, but the legs were a bit tight. 28 was just about perfect. and the best part....they are finally on sale. i look forward to wearing them with flats or heels and a simple white shirt!
2067	4	a	Purchased in a small. usually a 4-6-8. i layered over a sleeveless dress and i felt amazing. great for those tighter dresses. the fabric is sheer but not super see through. the tassle in the back is so creative. it closes enough in the back to not look weird. i have so many plans for this piece. black is the perfect color too. the collar colors are perfect too.
2068	1	a	This dress has so much potential- loved the pattern and the neckline. however, only one side of the waist was gathered with a fake sash leaving the other side plain. the gathered side was super flattering while the other side showed any little lump or bump. needless to say, i'm returning it.
2069	0	a	"I love these pants. the material is so nice and well made. i love the glittery threads within the pattern. the waistband is elastic which is good for me as my waistline fluctuates. these pants can be dressed up or down. the length was perfect and hit at my ankle (i'm 5'3). the only flaw is that i wish the pant leg was slimmer around the ankle. it would be a more flattering look. .   one thing to note: if you have a big butt or do not like to emphasize that part of you, these are not the pants"
2070	0	a	Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.
2071	4	a	This shirt is so soft and buttery! it fits tts and just as shown on the model. for the sale price, this shirt is a gonga! good go-to shirt on those days where you're just not sure what to wear. one thing that slightly bothers me about this shirt is that the arm holes are a bit loose, so you can see your bra. i think if you wear a black bra with it though, it would be fine.
2072	0	a	Love this skirt! it's definitely on the tight side, but is a stretchy material. i'm between a 6 and an 8 and went with the six because i liked the way it hugged my curves. as an hourglass shape i sometimes have problems finding pencil skirts - they either fit in the hips and are big at the waitband or the other way around. this one fit great throughout, and was both slimming in the front and flattering in the back. i was also worried that if i tucked anything into this skirt there would be weird
2073	4	a	I normally wear a large but this had no give through the bust! beware big chested girls!!!
2074	4	a	I love this top. the design is flattering and the fabric drapes nicely. the length is perfect and can dress it up and down.
2075	3	a	Unfortunately had to return this. i loved it but just doesn't work for my petite size.
2076	0	a	"You do not want to know how many cropped, wide-leg jeans i've tried on. all the rest make me look ridiculous for various reasons....it's not easy to get this style right, apparently. these are great: comfy, make my legs look cute, not chopped off, they are not mysteriously tight in the upper thigh (why do some do that?) they act like trousers with a jean's casual edge. the ""let out"" hem is super cute and they are soft and comfortable. perfect with tucked in or shorter blouse styles.  i bought"
2077	4	a	Very pretty. love the design both front and back
2078	0	a	Super comfy, easy to put on, and super cute! you can dress it up and dress it down! i'm usually a size s and the small fits fine, but i think the xs would have fit better.
2079	4	a	"I love the model's pairing of this sweatshirt and was struck by it when i walked in the store! like the other reviewer said, you could dress up or down (despite the ""sweatshirt"" name) and i'm planning to wear it with the galleria corduroy skirt and gray booties. love the stitched pockets on the side! (but i'm unlikely to put anything there since it would probably fall out!)  sizing: definitely boxy as the first reviewer said. i'm solidly a small in most tops, and this one i have a bit of spare"
2080	1	a	I ordered this on line first, but i really recommend getting to a store to look at them closely! due to the fact that the first dress, the embroidered lines were not sewn level on the bottom horizontal stripe areas, and the fact that they didn't meet made me feel it wasn't worth anywhere near the price! i feel you can sort of see this in the stock photo, although it may be just the way it's hanging. also, many of the center areas of the embroidered flowers and designs have a loose, unfinished th
2081	4	a	I love floreat and was excited to find this top on sale. i received multiple compliments the first day i wore it. it is true that it might be better with a bit less fabric but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. the flowy shape it ideal for summer.
2082	5	a	"This is a beautiful spring/summer dress, and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3"" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut, it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print, but still an ill-fitting sack."
2083	4	a	I ordered this on a whim, not sure what to expect. i'm petite (5'1, 110) and ordered a small petite. i usually wear xs-s in anthto tops but wanted a little extra room for layering in the cooler months ahead do i opted for the small petite instead of xs. it fits beautifully and is very cozy too. the collar is gorgeous and very soft. i think this is a beautiful and unique piece for any fall wardrobe.
2084	4	a	"Saw this in the store and immediately liked it. when i tried it on, i loved it. colors are muted, and the style is very flattering. the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy, which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south. length is perfect for me (5'8""). it does look great off the shoulders, but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more work-appropriate look. it does run slightly large. i wear a large, but went with a medium in this one so it wouldn't be to"
2085	1	a	Just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress! you can't tell from the pictures. i ordered thinking it was a dress but it's actually ... culottes? i'm not sure what you would call it. the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky. it definitely goes back!
2086	3	a	I ordered ths thinking it was likea blazer, but it is soft and not structured, like a t-shirt. however, it is rather flattering on. i had a har dtime deciding whether to keep it. the regular size was fine on me, i usually require peites, but this doesn't come in petites, and it was really nice with the fitted cowl shirt i was wearing. i am definitely putting it back in my wish list (as i did end up returning).
2087	0	a	Already got a lot of compliments on the first day i wore this skirt. great fun shape, very flattering. however, the 2 panels were sewn using some type of hard/plastic thread which becomes very itchy when you sit down (you can literally feel it through the liner and i'm concerned that over time it might actually rip it). very poor attention to details...
2088	1	a	Very pretty design. hugs the body correctly. it's a little tight in the chest for me - i'm a 34c (large c) and i have some back chub so i'm using this fact to motivate me to get in shape for the spring. keeping the dress and hoping for a better fit in a few months.
2089	0	a	"These chinos are really soft and comfortable, but they run really large. i have the 27 petite (5'4"" 115 lbs.) and they are too big. i originally bought the 28 petite and exchanged them for the 27 and after wearing the 27s all day i have realized they are significantly too big. they stretch as you wear them so they ended up completely saggy in the butt and hanging around my hip bones. i was in the store today and tried on a pair in 26 regular and those were also too big; i didn't have time to try"
2090	5	a	So, i really like the plaid designs by siyu. i saw these pants and questioned whether they would be tight and scratchy and ill fitting, but they were so cute, i had to find out. i'm really glad i did. the wool is soft and actually a little stretchy. it has an elastic waist, which is a plus, because sometimes, even if the legs fit, the waist is too small, or vice versa. i am a large, and very curvy on the bottom, and these are perfect and flattering, and the elastic waist is just right. as on the
2091	4	a	There's a free people version of this top and this by far surpasses the fit of it. i'm 5'3 and purchased the xl and it fits me exactly like the model. i would say it is tts and extremely soft.
2092	4	a	Not flattering and not the color it appears online. this is really a pink shirt.
2093	1	a	"I was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party. i'm 5'4"", 36c, 145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me. i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress (which is a sweater-like material) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering; the petite may have fixed it, but then the skirt would've been too short. the pleats were cute but flared out too"
2094	0	a	"I've been on the hunt for flattering cords for a long time, and these fit the bill! bought the silver on friday and am going to order the pink. the silver is really more taupe, as pictured, so if you're looking for true grey, this is not the pair for you. but the fit is fantastic. i'm 5'3"" athletic build about 130 lbs and the 27 fits perfectly. finally cords that don't make my muscular thighs look giant!"
2095	0	a	"I bought the skirt in green in size 6 (i am 5'4"" and 143 lbs). it fit very well and was very flattering and the length was perfect. i can see myself wearing it a lot this spring and in summer."
2096	0	a	These are a wonderful trouser style pant. i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isn't my top pick but it's a cute style! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut.
2097	4	a	I ordered one size down and it's still plenty roomy. as others have said, the sleeves are a tighter fit, but there is a tiny bit of stretch to the fabric. i'm smaller busted and didn't want the v-neck to get too low, so i sized down one. very cute tucked into jeans or paired with leggings.
2098	1	a	Really cute fun print. nice summer dress..
2099	4	a	Runs very big.  i ordered a l and need a m.  unfortunately no medium left!  great top with lots of character. hate i missed this cute top
2100	5	a	I was very excited to get this dress in the mail. i wasn't sure about the sizing because there weren't any reviews written yet. i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine, but there was just so much fabric below the bust. i love that it's different, but i think you'd have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you. it does not flatter your body at all.
2101	1	a	This dress is beautiful--lovely colors and design--but it's huuuge. i'm usually a s/m in tops and dresses, but i got an xs after trying it on in the store. i'm busty and have hips and still have a bit of room. the length is good--a little above the knee but still work appropriate. with my curves it's not my most flattering dress since it pretty much falls straight down, but i think it's too pretty not to keep.
2102	5	a	Doesn't fit as tight/as slimming as you think it would by looking at the picture, definitely order one size down if you want it to fit tight!
2103	4	a	"The colors are amazing, the fabric is beautiful; my only complaint is the cut. i am 5'8"" 130 lb and always a medium. i put the sweater on and the armhole area was short so it kept riding up- it almost fit like a petite with the higher cut in waist tailoring. i liked the sweater color and fabric so much i exchanged for a large."
2104	4	a	I could not resist this top. it is super cute, the material is nice and thick (you can get away with wearing no bra). shows off your bronzed or creamy skin to perfection. i can't wait to wear this :). i think the cut is very flattering for all figures. top might be a bit tight for very big busted ladies though.
2105	3	a	This jacket is extremely good quality, has gorgeous detailing and is warm! quilting makes it thicker than expected, but plan to wear as both a blazer and fall jacket. highly recommend.
2106	1	a	"I read the online reviews and thought this dress would be a winner. it is tight in the chest (i am not busty) and i would have exchanged it for a larger size but i just didn't like the style. the material is beautiful but between the neutral colors and the style, i felt it was too ""little house on the prairie"". pretty but not the look i was going for."
2107	4	a	Cozy slouchy sweater. very versatile. fits tts, just as shown on model.
2108	4	a	I'm consistently a 0p in this brand, but i ordered a regular zero, and i'm glad i did not get the petite because it would have been too cropped for me. it's a bit boxy, and the material is thicker than i thought, but it is a versatile piece that look forward to wearing!
2109	4	a	I am a teacher and love finding cute, comfortable clothes. i wore this for the first time today and got compliments all day long! i felt so stylish, and i was still able to do what i needed to do!
2110	4	a	More flattering than it looks on the model. comes in at the waist on me. i ordered it in blue, and it's very pretty; will go nice with a business suit but requires a cami underneath for work occasions.
2111	2	a	"I loved this dress from the moment i saw it! i ordered it immediately, after reading the reviews, and felt confident in my dress size choice...but when it arrived it was big! i am 5'7"" 140lbs with an athletic build and i usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, so usually a small but sometimes a medium...because if this ""in between"" that i am, i ordered a small...and it was really too big. so sad...incalled a bunch of stores to try and find an xs but they are sold out everywhere. style is fun and flir"
2112	2	a	I saw these in the store and was smitten. ordered online and have not been disappointed. love the pattern, the feel, and the fit. comfortable, fun and interesting. the regular length ones are definitely full-length on me but not too long. i might have gone with the petite length except that they didn't seem available, but am perfectly happy with the regular length.
2113	0	a	I have been looking for flares that are not tight through the thigh and these are definitely them...but for me they were so long that to hem them would ruin the style of the pants. i'm 5'5 and have long legs but i would need a high heel to maintain the intended style, and that's not what i was looking for. otherwise, beautiful.
2114	1	a	Got this dress in the mail today, and i am blown away. the fit is amazing! normally i would get an 8 in dresses, sometimes a 6, i got a 6 in this one and it's perfect. hugs in all the right places. everyone needs this dress! i feel like with the style and fit of this dress, it should be a little more snug so i recommend sizing down. cannot wait to wear this one!
2115	4	a	I love this with white leggings that skim my legs b/c it is a looser top that you can cinch at the waist. one small complaint is that the tie is awkward with the side slits, but for the sale price, i can overlook this.
2116	4	a	Love this sweater for so many reasons; fits true to size, unique in design, versatile, soft and so easy to wear. i've worn it tied in the back and front. it goes great with a skirt or dress pants for work, date night and elevates the look with any of my jeans. i love haying clothes i can get the most out of. highly recommend this sweater!
2117	4	a	This is such a cute vest. nice and cozy. so cute paired with a long sleeve tee, statement necklace, jeans and booties. very happy with my purchase!
2118	4	a	I pretty much love any sweater by moth. this one is no exception. soft, lofty, and a pretty shade (i bought in pink), this will be a cold weather staple.
2119	4	a	When i saw this online, it looked like a regular cardigan with a hood, but with looser arms and a generally looser fit. just be aware it has bat wings or something (not sure what it is called). there isn't one picture included with an arm lifted, so without a really close look, the arms look loose, but normal. i returned it :(
2120	4	a	This is a beautiful top. i purchased this in the green/moss color. it's reminds me of a vintage looking blue-green. it fits generously, has more of a swing style to it. i love it! i think it is romantic and feminine. glad i made the purchase. simply beautiful.
2121	4	a	I tried it in the store but was not the true size so i ordered online. i wore it only once so far and got lots of compliments. very unique design.
2122	4	a	Fit is oversized but intentional. flattering on. love the neckline. modesty might call for a tank top underneath if bending over. fabric is soft, stretchy and has a good quality heft to it.
2123	0	a	"I opened the package and loved this skirt immediately. i held it up and the waist is tiny. i'm usually a size 6 but sometimes go for a size 8 at retailer (i'm 5'6"" and 126 lbs). i would have needed at least 4 extra inches in the waist band to close the zipper...i wonder if this is a british size 8 or something. this 8 is closer to a 4. really disappointed."
2124	3	a	I really like this denim jacket with the plaid underneath. i also like the removable fur lining being that i live in florida i really don't need that. i ordered a size small which is my normal size and a medium. the small was tight in the arms so, i decided to keep the medium. i am really glad that i followed the others review in regards to sizing.
2125	1	a	I want to love this dress. the colors and the fabric are absolutely beautiful. it is definitely a swing-dress. much wider than i expected...and i sized down. there is also a strange pooch in the shape around the middle. i am keeping it because i am in love with the the colors and print, and it looks very flattering when paired with a black denim jacket, just not alone.
2126	5	a	I love these jeans. i am usually a size 27 or 28 in boyfriend jeans and i kept the size 28. i chose the baggier fit. the size 27 did fit, but it was a more fitted look. so i guess i would say you could definitely go with your regular boyfriend size and pick the fit that you prefer. i really feel like this is a jean that you should try on before purchasing, but the availability of these makes it almost impossible. i literally stalked the site so i could purchase both sizes and choose the ones tha
2127	3	a	"This is my third marrakech jacket in as many months. i love it! i was hesitant to order it because of the beige color. luckily it is more of a green beige. it is a very flattering jacket and yes, you do want to size up. this jacket is so comfortable i usually leave it on when i get home because i don't want to take it off. i am 5'5"", 34 b and the medium fits great!"
2128	3	a	Saw this in the store and loved it! the photos on line do not do this justice. material is soft and substantial. if you love the look of raw edge you'll love this piece. as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only 5' but kept it and love it.
2129	1	a	Wanted to love this dress, bit it wasn't to be. strange fit, and doesn't drape nicely, as in the photo. also, the blue color was much darker in person. wouldn't recommend.
2130	1	a	"Like other reviewers, i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it! well, i am very disappointed. the colors aren't as rich as the outdoor photo, although they're brighter than shown in the studio photos. this is just not a flattering dress. i've put it on three times and taken it back off. the neck is too high, the sleeves are too narrow (and i have really skinny arms), and there's no ""swing"" to it. i am 5'4"" and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small, which is what"
2131	1	a	"I went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress, and i'm so glad i did. the fit was perfect. i'm always a little hesitant about long dresses since i'm 5'2"", but the petite length was perfect. the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable, but i feel elegant in it. i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month."
2132	4	a	The simplicity of this t-shirt will go with jeans, shorts, or anything casual. the macrame and bead details give it that extra style. i bought the red and white, and love them both. the red is warm and bright, with pink undertones. despite the boxiness of the fit, it ran true to size for me. i did not think it was too big; its meant to be loose and slouchy rather than fitted.
2133	4	a	I've been moving toward a simple tee and jean wardrobe, and this is the perfect addition! it's so fun and different and so comfortable. i've been loving retailer's new tee's! it runs a little large but in a cute way.
2134	0	a	Really cute, really comfy, great color, love the oversize buttons! all around just a great skirt. nice shade that goes right into fall. i have several of this style skirt and love them all!
2135	1	a	I really liked the dress on line, but, i didn't appreciate how lovely it was until i received it. it fit perfectly, and has a lovely flare at the hemline for a flirty feel. i wear it with taupe colored booties and it is perfect for work and afterwork.
2136	5	a	"I read some of the other reviews and was surprised about comments that the color was off... i thought they were pretty dead on. i absolutely love this jacket, but do agree that it's more of a sweater-coat than a heavy coat you'd wear in the winter. but, i live in california, so this will be just perfect for our winter. i was afraid it might be too ""classic"" and uptight looking... but it's so fun! the bell sleeves add some extra flair. the overall coat has some stretch to it as well... making it"
2137	4	a	I love everything bordeaux so when i saw this one i knew i needed to try it and it's my favorite top from this brand ever. i hope they keep the style and offer it in all of the colors going forward. it's a very flattering style for anyone - accentuates shape without being tight or clingy and the stripes are lovely. also the material is so soft. i have not washed it yet so i hope it stands up to wash and wear well. overall this is an amazing top. it runs slightly large. i'm usually an xs in tops
2138	4	a	I ordered this shirt in both white and coral. i absolutely love the design and coral color. the white was a bit see through, so i returned it. it would be cute with a cami under, but i just wanted something that did not require an extra layer. overall, it is a flattering fit and i love the detail on the back.
2139	0	a	"I was not sure whether i would like an xs or a s. rompers can be tricky. i am 5'6"" 123lbs. i went ahead and ordered the xs and it is perfect. it is just long enough in the body for me. the shorts length is perfect, not too short or too long. i can't wait to wear this!"
2140	2	a	I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.
2141	4	a	This is such a pretty top.  i love the mix of patterns. the colors are beautiful!  it really looks great on.  the peplum is very minimal in this top.  the entire top itself is somewhat oversized, but in a pretty way.  i bought this in a large and probably could have gone with a medium, but didn't want the length to be any shorter, so i'm sticking with the large.  for reference,  i'm 6ft and 175lbs.  i usually wear a size 10/12 or medium/large.  also, i didn't notice a puckering between the two m
2142	1	a	"This is absolutely beautiful.  but i am only 5'6""and the dress hits my thigh about the same place as it does on the model. one lean over to pick up my purse off the floor and i will flash everyone.   so i am going to wear it with dark denim leggings and tall boots.   likewise i did not detect even a speck of black. to me it is navy and purple. i was wishing it had black because those are my favorite leggings but quite honestly i think you're going to have to do navy or denim."
2143	4	a	I absolutely love this top!! i bought the ivory color, and i am definitely considering buying the black as well! it feels true to size, but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy. i can't wait to wear this top all season long!
2144	0	a	I wanted to love this skirt and i agree with the other reviewers. the color of the skirt is beautiful. i've never seen anything quite like it at retailer! the quality is superb and the material is fairly substantial given the brocade design. however, the skirt made my hips look a lot bigger than they are because the shape of the skirt is more of a tulip-design. i purchased an 0 petite (because my normal size 00 petite was sold out) and while the waist part fit the hip part was disproportionately l
2145	2	a	"I received these as a christmas gift. they are really cozy: warm, soft and super comfortable. however, they stretch out a lot, as there is no drawstring or elastic on the waist band. this leads them to poof out a lot and i have to keep pulling them up. this is fine for hanging out around the house, but not if you want to wear them out and about. i'm keeping them because they're so comfortable, but beware how much they stretch. (i am 5'6"", 130 lbs and the size small fits well)."
2146	1	a	"I'd give this dress 6 stars if i could, it's possibly the best dress i've bought at retailer in 12 years of shopping there.  the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage  for anyone with a bit of a tummy. the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly (even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear), the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch, the fit is true to size, the pattern is bohemian and elegant -- not hippy dippy at all. i'm 5'6"""
2147	4	a	I tried this on in the store and had to have it. this is the kind of sweater that you just want to cozy up with on a nice fall or winter day with a cup of coffee in hand. i love the neutral pink color as it will go with everything. i'm a dress and skirt girl and this will go well with those items. it will cover your bum and i love the dolman sleeves. i highly recommend it!!
2148	4	a	"Saw this top on-line and thought i would give it a try. i am glad i did. there is not a thing wrong with this top. cute design, nice weight fabric,(no cami needed underneath) and it fits very well. for reference i am 5' 1"", 120lbs. and 35c. and of course it goes with literally every piece of clothing you would wear on the bottom half of your body! this is a keeper."
2149	4	a	I had bought the pull over in the same fabric and now this zipper jacket style. so fun and love the texture. i waited for markdown plus promo and it was worth waiting.
2150	1	a	This is a cute casual dress that could be worn with flip flops or boots.
2151	4	a	This top runs huge. not only in the torso/chest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy. i am normally between a m-l but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work.
2152	4	a	I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately, i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that, it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all, i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!
2153	1	a	I do not see this as frumpy if you wear it with heels. i think the bodice is very flattering.
2154	1	a	"I?m not the type of woman that wears dresses, but oh man...this dress! i?ve been eyeing it for a while, and it finally went on sale, then the extra 30% off made me cave. got it for $115. i bought it one size smaller (8) to encourage me to not over-indulge this xmas, and if fit like a glove. for reference, i?m 36 bust, 30 waist and normally a size 10 in retailer. it accentuates your curves & hugs your body while being ""sexy/conservative"". the intricate embroidery is exquisite and very eye catching."
2155	0	a	"While i love the fabric and the pattern, this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get. there is no mention online that there is no built in slip, and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through.  also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is 'pull-on styling.' i would say that it is true to size, and i am usually a medium @ retailer, but i have a sm"
2156	1	a	Bought this dress on sale in the orange as i feel like everything i have is black. it is a pretty orange not too bright, more of a rust color. it is very soft as stated in other reviews and has a nice built in slip that is very comfortable. i worry about pilling down the road but will have to wait and see. i am not crazy about the seams down the chest area. i think they could be more flattering but overall the dress is comfortable, cute and easy to wear, a perfect dress for the fall/winter with
2157	4	a	I absolutely love this jacket! i bought it and wore it to work to next day, and received tons of compliments! it is easy to move in as i have ark that required stretching and bending alot. i am 5 5 119 pounds and xs fit a well.
2158	1	a	"This is the most perfect dress i've ever bought. i'm 5'8"" and the length was perfect. the cut is flattering and very slimming. the fabric is gorgeous and the pattern is stunning. please offer more dresses in this cut!!"
2159	1	a	"I loved this dress in the photos and couldn't wait to try it on in person. the print varies from dress to dress and mine had noticeably much more cream color in it. i didn't mind too much but it didn't look like the dress the model is wearing. i bought the xxs petite which fit true to size. the v neck is a bit low for petite sizing but the length was perfect on my 5'2"" frame which was a plus. i agree with the other reviewers the fabric is cheap and feels cheap. not something i would expect from"
2160	0	a	Ag is my go-to brand for comfortable, high quality jeans. these fit the bill!
2161	4	a	Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however, after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater, but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.
2162	4	a	I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors, really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t
2163	4	a	"I stopped into retailer the other day for some ""window"" shopping and as soon as i saw this cardigan, it was love and i had to try it on. the sleeves run long on me but i'm on the shorter side so it was to be expected. everything else about this cardigan is amazing. i ran errands yesterday and it was the perfect weight for our cooler autumn weather. love this cardigan."
2164	0	a	"These jeans are an even dark color that can be dressed up. the material is soft and they fit perfect. they are mid rise which is a little different for me as i mostly where low rise. the only problem is that they are really long. i am 5'9"" and they are too long for me which never happens. so i need to get them hemmed and wont be wearing them for a few more weeks. i look forward to rocking them with a pair of booties or heels."
2165	2	a	I know this is labeled under activewear, but the fabric is a dream, it's incredibly flattering and could absolutely be worn in any outfit! i just bought the moss and may end up getting the other colors too. i generally am a l or xl, and the large fit well. it's alined and has a bit of stretch to it. it's so comfortable! highly recommend!
2166	4	a	I love this sweater! it does run a little large though. fits beautifully. great for cool summer nights and early fall. dress up or down.
2167	1	a	I wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work. the fabric is gorgeous, but the fit was very unflattering. it's too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes. i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise. in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldn't compensate for the very unflattering fit.
2168	3	a	"Tried on my normal size in the store and i was swimming in it. the sales associate suggested i order the petite in store. perfect! i just wish there were more opportunities to try on petite sizes in store. this coat is soft and roomy. when it's buttoned up it has a great shape too."
2169	3	a	I'm usually a 12, or size l in retailer and when i tried this on, buttoning it up from the bottom, i was so excited...until i reached the chest. it was way too tight in the bust and i am not that big in that area - it was painfully tight on my 38d chest. it's also unlined, which makes it not very useful for anything other than the warmest times of year. it's a shame because the skirt is swishy, and a good length - many trenches are too short, or not wide enough on the bottom for a fuller figure. i
2170	2	a	I bought this tunic to wear as a swim cover-up, last minute. but it has become my go to for wearing over skinny jeans. the length makes it so versatile, great layering piece.
2171	4	a	Wish they had more colors avail in my size when i bought this one. you can easily dress it up or down.
2172	0	a	I absolutely loved these pants when i tried them on. i am 5'1 and will definitely need it hemmed because they are so so long. but i'm fine with that because these pants are so unique and gorgeous. i'm 130 lbs usually a size small but xs fit me just fine. i will have to say though, i am very upset because my pants shipped with a huge tear in the waistband. the only way i was able to try them on was because the last bit of the waistband was hanging on by a thread. so the quality isn't too great. a
2173	4	a	"I have worn this with skinny jeans and espadrilles untucked and with black linen shorts. i also wore tucked in with high waisted slim fit black pants,  i got compliments on all the looks. i think it's a fun and cheerful, feminine summer top.  i got mine on sale so i thought was a fair price for what it is. wouldn't have paid full retail.  requires ironing.  i am a size 4 and 5'3 and have a small."
2174	4	a	This top looks just like you see it on the website - design is super cool and color is awesome, almost acid washed in areas. but know that this top is super, super thin and will not provide any warmth. i wish it were a bit thicker in fabric, it would have been perfect for the cool fall and going into winter especially for the price. the medium in this one fit me better than the small. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.
2175	1	a	This is a classic pencil dress that would be becoming on most straight figures. i always wear a 6 (or medium) in hd, and this dress is a little large everywhere. i love it so much, i paid full price and i will probably have it taken in on the sides if possible. the lacework is gorgeous and sturdy - it doesn't catch on stuff. there is a lot of give to sit and move in, unlike most pencil dresses, and i cannot say enough about the color. wow, heads turn when you walk into a room in this gorgeous de
2176	1	a	I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it, but i could not. there were spots missing sequence, some fell off as i tried the dress on, and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly, for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes.
2177	1	a	I love this maxi dress. it is fitted up top and very maxi like on the bottom. it was to much fabric for me, the dress made me look heavier than i am. i am 5'9' and 160. i fit in the medium. the dress just didn't do anything for my body type - curvy. i think you need to be fairly lean to look nice in this dress. sadly, i had to return. maeve makes great maxi's, unfortunately they don't fit me correctly.
2178	4	a	"I'm 5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress. one of these beauties ended up in our store and i had to try it on. the sleeves are no joke - serious bell sleeves that could have looked comical with the polka dots, but is surprisingly chic. the one i purchased was a medium - never had an opportunity to try a small, which i suspect is my actual size. buying it oversized made this magical. it feels modern. i actually think because the whole sweater is oversized on me, it makes the sleeves less cartoonish."
2179	0	a	I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material, i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim, not the lovely light blue as pictured, another reason why i am returning.
2180	4	a	So soft that i bought in 3 colors. i love wearing them. it is comfortable yet tailored. i highly recommend.
2181	1	a	"I tried on this dress in the store and was pleasantly surprised with the fit and the look. it looks way better in person than in the pictures. the picture really doesn't do it justice. i consider myself a ""slight"" hour glass figured girl and this dress at the top hit me just right so that the crosswrap looks like it was made for my body and the peephole/keyhole in the front (you can hardly see on the model photo) is visible. i'm so happy with this dress!!! i feel like i could wear it at work/chu"
2182	4	a	I had been looking for a chambray shirt, but am not a fan of the typical button-down style. this shirt is very versatile, but is far more interesting with the lace up neckline. i received multiple compliments the first time i wore it. the material is incredibly soft, but i haven't laundered it yet, so i am not sure how it will holdup.
2183	4	a	I see no one has reviewed this yet and since it is a beautiful sweater, and only available online, i thought i would contribute an opinion. the sweater is nicer in real life than the photo. it has a wonderful feel! the style: this sweater has very dramatic sleeves which i like though i could understand how that might annoy someone else. it is made with a heavy thick soft yarn so the sleeves hang nicely. i have worn it once and got complements so it is a sweater that while simple, is also a stand
2184	1	a	"I am 5'-7"" and 135 lbs, i bought a medium petite as i wanted the dress to hit at my knees, instead of midi. this dress is easily 2 sizes bigger than expected. the pattern was not flattering on my although i'm sure it would be for others. i was happy with the length..."
2185	4	a	After reading the other reviews, i felt compelled to write one for this top. it is not often that i get to shop at an retailer store, but a few weeks ago, i had the pleasure. i saw this top, and while it was not on sale, i had to have it. yes, it is sheer and so you do need a camisole under it. the gold and silver embroidery is gorgeous. to be honest, this is my favorite top in my closet right now. i can dress it up or make it more casual. and, now that it's on sale, don't hesitate in this purchas
2186	1	a	This dress has a beautiful color and design. however it runs too big. i'm usually between size 2 or 4 on antropologie's cloths. i had to size down to size 0 to get a more fitted look like the model.
2187	2	a	These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee. i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman. these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of.
2188	3	a	I don't own any peach outerwear because i didn't think it would complement my skintone. this cozy bomber proved me wrong. wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that's eye catching. great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe. this is not a fitted style, it's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist, just like a regular bomber jacket. i chose medium petite and it fits just right. i'm a 36d, 135#, 38-28-35.
2189	4	a	I purchased this online because i just loved the gorgeous designs and embroidery. it has a unique cut to it as it has wrist holes but is otherwise open. i have a difficult time keeping it from falling off of my shoulders when i wear it over bear skin. i hope it will stay in place when i wear it over long sleeves or a sweater. overall i am happy with it, but i think it may run small as it hits the model at her wrists but hits me above my elbow. i am not very tall or long-limned so it seems strang
2190	4	a	What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point, i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead, i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s, made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.
2191	4	a	I absolutely love this top. i thought it was going to be to big but it fits perfectly. fitted and flattering.
2192	4	a	Love this top, i would have bought two but the grey is sold out in my size. very comfortable and true to size.
2193	3	a	The only thing i didn't like about this is i wish it was a little bit shorter, but otherwise great! throw it on with pants and add a bit of color and spring/summer'ness to your outfit!
2194	0	a	I needed to get this hemmed about 3-4 inches, but it was well worth it. this is a gorgeous, effortlessly glam outfit. the material is silky soft, with some stretch, and drapes beautifully. i am a 12/14 and got an xl-- i think a large would have been better (this had extra width at the waist, but it worked with the tie belt). i loved wearing this and felt comfortable all night.
2195	0	a	I am petite so ordered in the store and they shipped to my home. i ordered a 24p and they fit great. they stretch a tiny bit. goes with a lot of tops and they are light weight which is great with houston westher
2196	5	a	Oh this is so much prettier in person! what you can't see from the pics is that the bottom flutes out a bit. it is quite charming. fits true to size.
2197	0	a	"I am usually a 28/29 in skinnys. mih usually runs small so i ordered the size 30 knowing the length wld be too long. well the fit is great. i am a little curvy w/ slender legs. the size 30 sits just below my navel, snug throughout hips & thighs, then gradually begins to flare below the knee to the bottom. super long, will have to cut off abt 4-5"" to suit me. i don't wear sky-high shoes. i wear low to flat sandals in summer & medium heel booties in cooler weather. maybe i'll cut them & try them a"
2198	1	a	I really wasn't sure if this dress would work for me, so i was very excited when i fell in love with it! i haven't experienced any quality or tearing issues with it as one reviewer noted, thank goodness! i love the color scheme and versatility of this dress. i have worn it with tights, a belt and short-heeled ankle booties to make it a little more dressy. but i most love it with some funky jewelry and leggings, wearing it more tunic style. the slip underneath is a great feature as well! it does
2199	4	a	This shirt is beautiful. it is flowy and light, a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring. however, do not follow the washing instructions on the tag. it says you can machine wash, tumble dry low, and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low, it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it. it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again. if you do order, please take the
2200	4	a	"At 4""11 i usually have to order items in petite and sometimes still have trouble fitting properly into items but i was able to buy this sweater in an xs! i figured with the high front and low back i wouldn't be able to fit it but it looks great on. not only is the fit amazing, but it feels amazing as well. it's such an easy wear and the high/low look is effortlessly chic!"
2201	4	a	I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.
2202	1	a	This dress is really beautiful. i have already worn it to both an engagement party (fancy) and just out to dinner (casual); it fits most occasions, depending on what you pair it with, which always makes me feel like i have gotten my full money's worth. i've gotten several compliments on it; the best one being that it looks as though i was wearing a piece of art! the outside material of the dress is silky in texture and has a nice sheen to it. it looks true to the picture on the website. the dres
2203	3	a	This jacket is the best! definitely my staple jacket for the spring. it is so comfortable and soft. i usually wear a small in retailer clothing, but i opted for the medium in this so there's a little room for layering. even with the extra room, it is so flattering. i absolutely love this jacket!
2204	4	a	I love the off the shoulder tee so much that i ordered two of them in different colors. i can wear them with jeans or i can wear them with gym attire while out running errands and still feel like i look nice!
2205	4	a	This top is the very same top meadow rue had a couple of years ago. i have that top and it is identical so my guess is meadow rue and deletta are owned by the same company.
2206	0	a	I tried these on in in a 27/4 in the store and they were a bit snug. they graciously offered to look online and found the 28/6. they arrived in less than a week and are perfect. a note was enclosed saying they actually ran out of this size but another store was able to find them and ship...i love that retailer did not even call and worry me over it, they just fixed the problem. thank you!
2207	1	a	Such a great dress! it is super flattering. i love that its not too short on me(i am 5'11).
2208	4	a	"This is one of the best purchases f i have made at retailer recently. i got this in ivory in my usual xs. the pictures do not do it justice.  it has such a nice drape and i love the detail on the back.  looks great with black cropped trousers, as well as skinny jeans."
2209	4	a	Although this shirt runs a little large, the snowflske and stripes makes it a classic. very comfortable shirt.
2210	4	a	"Great fit and quality. i'm 5'3"" and 130 lbs, size 4 fit perfectly. bought both the blue and black. could definitely dress up or down!"
2211	1	a	I like the way the skirt of the dress swings when you move. in order to get the arm holes to not be too low, i ended up with the smaller of the two sizes i usually buy. i also appreciate the dress has pockets and the soft fabric. the tag says you can machine wash cold gentle which is also a plus!
2212	0	a	"I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived, i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been. problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then). problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other"
2213	1	a	I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.
2214	4	a	It's still a bit cool here in minnesota. however, it won't be long before i can wear this lightweight, drapey but figure-flattering blouse. i am 5ft 3in and the 0 petite, fits well.
2215	3	a	Love this vest. fits very similar to the pilcro denim jacket. the fabric is softer, and not too heavy. the wash on mine is pretty close to the one in the picture, maybe half a shade darker. can see myself wearing this with summer maxi dresses, skirts, and pants, a very versatile piece that will go into fall. i usually take a 0/2 and the xs fit perfectly.
2216	0	a	I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size, cute, and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot, but back to the store they went.
2217	4	a	"I sized up to a medium from a small and was glad i did. the top drapes nicely and the fabric is soft.   5'7"" 140 lb 32 b, usually a small on top."
2218	4	a	I bought this item from online... the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight! so i took it back to the store & ordered a larger size. for the sale price this is a great top.
2219	4	a	The colors are beautiful
2220	3	a	"I agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that it's a much lovelier color in person, but that's about it for me. thoughts below: _____________ pros: - tts. i ordered the medium for my 36c, 5'9"" frame and found it sufficient. - the color is much nicer in person, as the other reviewer mentioned. it's a richer brown. think ""mocha latte"" in terms of color. - the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it"
2221	0	a	I love the coh fleetwood jeans, and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans, i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods, which are a substantial weight denim, these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in, these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.
2222	0	a	I am amazed this is still on sale. it's so comfortable and fabulous!!
2223	1	a	Easy to wear.  the fabric is super soft and the shape is very flattering.   i really like the shirt hem at the bottom.
2224	4	a	I am loving this shirt. i thought it would look ridiculously long on me but it does not. for me this is a great substitute for the cloth & stone fringed plaid buttondown dress. it's definitely not a dress but is long enough to pull off the layered look of wearing a t-shirt and this on top. it will be a great piece for the fall given how incredibly soft and light weight it is. highly recommend.
2225	4	a	I like the casual, yet detailed look of this piece. it looks great with crops. the casual tie string makes the piece feel very laid back, but the details are so pretty. i have it in lavender. it looks way better in person. saw it at the store and grabbed it immediately.
2226	3	a	This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost didn't send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt, but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one. it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front, or leave it open. great looking, casual but stylish and neat. a good grey, and a good blue.
2227	5	a	I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small, but returned and exchanged for a medium, which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall.
2228	4	a	I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.
2229	0	a	"I'm 5'7"", 120 lbs, size 0 was best.  ordered the green color.  great flattering fit!"
2230	4	a	Definitely size up...possibly two sizes. i can often wear an xs and the s is skin tight on me. other than that, it's a nice neutral piece.
2231	1	a	"I love everything about this dress! i love the colors - style and fit. it is so comfortable. i had so many people ask where i got it.  i usually wear an xs or s in retailerpolgy dresses and i got this in an xs and it was perfect."
2232	3	a	Just got this vest in my store yesterday and i was immediately drawn to it. the outside of the vest is this thick knit in an oatmeal color and a bright cobalt blue (even brighter than it appears online). the inside is a jersey knit fabric in grey. its an eye catcher for sure. i knew i needed to try it on. the vest is longer in length (like it appears in the photos). my only gripe is the fit. its great around the neck...nice and full. but i wish the body of the vest was larger. it fits very much
2233	1	a	"So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5""6"" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition."
2234	1	a	Good dress to wear with heels, flats, tights. versatille!
2235	4	a	"Normally i like to purchase from the store so i can try things on first, but this top wasn't available locally. i guessed on a medium. i'm 5'5"" and very curvy and the medium fits just like the picture on the model. just a hint of a sleeve and nice and drapey-loose over the body. the embroidery is just beautiful. the only reason i'm not giving 5 stars for quality is that i had to sew two buttons onto the back, my top came without them."
2236	1	a	Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue, not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress, however, the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it, but i returned it.
2237	1	a	"This dress is stunning. it is beautifully made with laces and beading in a way that is art. it fits in a very flattering and comfortable way. i think is would flatter any body type. the details are captivating and it immediately grabs the spotlight when you walk into a room. i ordered online and when it arrived i was stunned with it's exotic use of fabrics, textures.....a rare find and a must have."
2238	0	a	I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer, actually), the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion, and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small, but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a
2239	1	a	This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is.
2240	2	a	Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.
2241	1	a	This is so adorable and flattering. dress it up or down with a denim jacket weekday to weekend.w/flats or pumps. love this cute dress. not all wool so it's not itchy at all. the colors are vibrant and would compliment any complexion!
2242	3	a	This jacket is high quality leather and will bring you years of wear! i made sure to add a little room to accommodate thick sweaters!
2243	4	a	"I am 5'10"", 130 pounds. a medium is a perfect fit for me. i love it! not so sheer that i feel that i need to wear a cami underneath, sleeves are long, and it is so, so, so soft. the scoop neck shows just the right amount without being too revealing. i am buying one in every color."
2244	1	a	I love this silhouette. it is such a flattering cut! but the prints didn't work for me. please make this in black! or grey! or any solid color. pretty please...
2245	1	a	"This dress is a winner! the material is not stiff like many neoprene dresses - it is soft and silky and has amazing drape. the dress is very flattering! the material is very stretchy even through the waist, so it is and easy ""perfect fit"" on different body types. i loved the shorter versions of the dress, but they weren't workable for me, but this length is perfect. and there are pockets that are sewn in with perfect detailing - they don't stick out or disturb the line of the dress."
2246	3	a	Ooo la la! sooo chic! sooo retailer!!
2247	4	a	The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
2248	0	a	Super flattering and lovely material. dress-up or down. they run true to size.
2249	4	a	I love this top. i also have it in blue! i wish it came in more colors/ prints! i would definitely buy it!
2250	4	a	Cute shirt with a few nice details: embroidery and tasseled tie in back. a little pricey in my view for what you get. nice, loose cut. true to size. cotton is very sheer. i'm well-stocked on white see-through shirts that require a cami, looking for one that doesn't need layering- returned for this reason.
2251	4	a	In my retailer this was hung over in the pj section, and it really has more of a jammie top feel... soft, thin and stretchy. it's super cozy and comfortable and it drapes really nice. mine seems to have stretched out a little, especially the neckline (and the little buttons have a hard time staying closed). i'm happy with it though for what it is - a great, casual day t.
2252	4	a	This is very unique and stylish! the embroidery is stunning plus it is extremely comfortable. it is pretty warm. it does not itch me at all as others have noted.
2253	4	a	"I'm 5'4, 125 lbs, & have a 36 c/d bust; the xs fits great. i wash everything in cold & line dry... this was no exception. when i took it out of the washer i knew immediately :( i've pulled it back into shape & hung it up, but we'll see.  dry clean if you want to keep it"
2254	2	a	I love this tank! basic but super sexy! i'm an a cub and this tee makes them look a lil bigger so i'll take it!! i bought the dark grey in small and went back for the striped grey and purchased small. i bought the black one too but i feel like the small in black is too big and the xsmall is too small. i'm torn because i want the black to tuck in a pencil skirt.
2255	4	a	Great top for everyday wear. runs a little large as i usually for size medium and i bought a small. a tiny bit see through but i think i can get away without wearing a tank underneath.
2256	1	a	There isn't anything i don't love about this dress! get it before it's gone! i get compliments every time i wear this dress.
2257	4	a	Although i'm returning, this is a cute top. the embroidery design on the front isn't really my style. it's a bit aztec-y for me.
2258	4	a	Love this henely, the lace-up is cute. the shirt is comfy. so versatile. beach coverup or over jeans
2259	1	a	Comfortable and true to size. it fits more fitted on the top and very swingy/flowy on the bottom. i got a petite and the length was perfect. if you like to wear very high heels you may want to go with a regular as its a tad short.
2260	0	a	I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips, buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then, size up.
2261	1	a	This is a lovely dress, with great fabrication. nice detail on the zipper placket. good material. however, it runs small in the waist, if you had a nymph waist this is for you! i couldn't get it zipped.
2262	0	a	"I had been looking for something like this to add to my summer wardrobe. fortunately for me i saw these in the retailer catalog and thought, how perfect, exactly what i've been searching for. they are a bit pricey, and crotch hangs a bit lower on me because i'm only 5'3, but it's not enough to make me send them back, i will have them altered if need be, they are to cute.   i'm a size 4 in pants and ordered the 29, i wanted some wiggle room, i didn't realize the denim has stretch, i will keep the"
2263	1	a	This dress is very cute on. very flouncy. i know it looks like a gingham dress, but it's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern. the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size (bug or small), and i am larger on top, so i don't know what would happen with someone with a small chest. i wouldn't have minded if it did the same thing on the front, but it was just the back.
2264	1	a	"I found this in-store when looking for a dressy, slightly boho dress for an upcoming wedding. i'm really happy with it -- the a-line cut disguises some recently gained extra pounds but it doesn't feel like i'm hiding in a muumuu because the shoulders and chest are relatively fitted. the flowy hemline offsets the short length (maybe 4-5"" above the knee for me). the pink color is very light -- lighter than in the photos, i think -- but it will work nicely for the wedding. as the first reviewer sai"
2265	2	a	Love this print and fabric! its soft and comfy with adjustable straps. so pretty and feminine!
2266	1	a	Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i'd try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however, like others have commented, it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.
2267	4	a	I need one in every color. so super soft.
2268	1	a	I thought it was the perfect dress by the picture but it ended up looking like a grandma muumuu. the color is nice, the neck is cute, but the form unflattering. i'm trying to decide if i want to taylor it or take it back.
2269	4	a	This is a lovely jacket. i thought it was going to be thicker, but it's so classy and chic. i got several comments on it, and i've only worn it once! great jacket to have in my closet. i can wear it to work, to dress up an outfit for school, or to complete an outfit.
2270	4	a	Beautiful top for summer. love the yellow under the thin white fabric. the photo is good representation. running big.
2271	4	a	"This shirt is really cute and runs large. i am a true s and this shirt came as big as what i would call an l.  i get that its a boyfriend t-shirt feel but it was still surprising. if you're an s i suggest xxs and so forth.  the color is yellow but not as yellow as the picture shows."
2272	4	a	"This shirt is a great deal on sale,i would not pay full price.i got it in the honey color and it is really cute. this shirt does run very large. i normally wear a small or size 4 to 6 and i was lost in a size 6. i went with a size 2 and it was perfect for sizing purposes i am a 34c and 5'3"" 112lbs..shirt is a bit lightweight so it is nice for summer or year round."
2273	4	a	"It took a minute, but once i figured out how to wear this, i loved it. it is meant to be oversized, and for me looks best with leggings and ankle boots (too much bulk to be worn with even a slim skirt). i'm 5'9"", curvy and long limbed. the fabric has a thick, high quality feel; i find it quite soft and comfy. the unexpected design of the ribbing gives it a subtle chic; it's fashion forward without trying too hard. the ""cowl"" is really closer to a boatneck with an extra fold, which works well for"
2274	4	a	Great green color. drapes well. nice gray detailing adds dimension to an already pretty sweater.
2275	3	a	Agree with other reviewers the jacket is better in person than on model very nice jacket model does it no justice
2276	2	a	"My review is of the ""black motif"" (no longer listed online, but i saw a bunch in the clearance sock bin at the georgetown dc store, today, 12/27/2015).  i love beautiful and unique socks! so i thought i'd give these a chance. i like them so much that i bought 3 more pairs of the exact same sock now that they're on sale!  two things i noticed... the way the sock is knit, when you put it on, it no longer has a matte black look in the black areas. it is sort of a stretched, slightly two-tone look."
2277	2	a	"I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown. if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it. i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight. on the upside, the fabric was soft and lightweight."
2278	4	a	Love this top!  it is fitted through the shoulders and arms and has a slight swing.  the peplum falls at a great spot and the material lays nicely.  very flattering on my 5 months postpartum body that is on the rebound.  i got the blue but i might get the pink too!
2279	0	a	Overall, very nice pair of boyfriend style jeans. super comfy. i asked one of the in store stylist for help styling them- she was very helpful and showed me lots of possibilities for these pants. also good for a post-partum tummy :)
2280	4	a	This is one of the most flattering tops i've ever owned. i'm a little confused by the other reviews, because the model in the photo doesn't have it tacked in the back. you can see on the photo of the back, there's a button to pull it in which makes it so incredibly flattering. it's soft and beautiful, but very delicate. i'd wash it separately and carefully, and rarely :) i actually had to return my first one because of a hole in the material. overall, one of my new favorite tops.
2281	4	a	I want to live in this sweatshirt. it's so comfy, but also well-cut and lays nicely, not boxy at all. i'm typically a 10-12 or l in tops and the 3 is roomy without looking sloppy.
2282	0	a	"I love these pants. a dry cleaner lost my favorite black pair ten years ago. i have not used them since. if you wait long enough, everything comes back in style. i bought black and rust. these pants are comfortable, the perfect length, can dress up or down and are very, very cute."
2283	4	a	I purchased this in gray and it is proving to be quite versatile. it is softer than i expected and not heavy or bulky. i also like that the side slits are a bit higher than i expected. i have paired it with knit pants and with a maxi dress. i think it will work pretty much any time i need an extra layer.
2284	2	a	"I ordered this piece online and returned it at the store a few days after arrival. the material is very soft and well made. however it is not flattering on the hourglass or pear shaped person. moreover, if you are short, the design may make you look shorter. i am 5'4"" and it did to me. the design is beautiful. if you are tall and have narrow hips, this is the piece for you. i am 5'4"", 160lbs and usually wear a s/m."
2285	0	a	Incredibly soft and comfortable, not as fitted as i would like (this often happens to me with skinny pants, though). i want to wear these guys everyday!
2286	4	a	"But runs large. i tried on the regular 0 in the store and it was very pretty but baggy. would definitely need a tank if i were to wear this to work. lace is romantic and i do like the button details. i would give it a try but for me i will take my chance and wait for sale if it makes it there in my sie. i need 00. petite already gone sadly.   reference 115 lbs 30dd and 26.5 on waist."
2287	1	a	"I ordered the 00 p after trying on the regular 0, and that was better. it runs wide, the lining is true to size, but the overlay is loose. the colors are pretty, the design is nice, but i didn't love it as much as other ones.  likes: the studs add an edgier look to a almost dainty look (flow y sheer fabric). the cut is flattering if you get the right size (recommend one size down).  no big dislikes...why i would still recommend.  115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist... 00p"
2288	4	a	I found this cardigan/sweater in the sale room at retailer in navy. thought i would just try it on. the picture does not do this justice. it is a basic piece but it is so soft and comfortable and when on, it has a little bit of a whimsical swing to it. i loved the way it kind of came to life. i wear a m/l and bought the m. i have a 36d bust and it looked great. it is a nice weight for spring/fall. it is not a heavy sweater.
2289	4	a	I am so pleased with this product. it is a great staple for every woman. my one complaint is that it easily pulls.. something to be mindful of when handling the garment.
2290	1	a	The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely, but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack, i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down, but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference, i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.
2291	4	a	It is a little boxy, but it?s not unflattering in my opinion. the sweatshirt material is soft, the ruffles keep their shape and position, and aren?t too overwhelming on my small frame. i like the small slits on the sides, they allow the sweater to drape nicely. it also hit at a flattering spot, a little below the hip. 5?1??, 100 lbs, and got the xxs petite. this fit true to size for me.
2292	3	a	This coat is wonderful! i am usually an xs-s in retailer and i got the xs. it is supposed to be a bit large. goes with everything and great quality.
2293	4	a	I really love this shirt! i ordered the orange and am considering getting the other color too. it's very comfortable and cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. this shirt definitely runs large and i had to exchange the medium for a small. the looser cut makes it very easy for this to look like a maternity shirt, so i'd advise everyone to size down.
2294	0	a	So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews, they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly, too. there are weird fading marks all over, even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely
2295	5	a	"I love his cardigan! i knew the small would be a little big since i am normally an xs or xxs. i decided to give it a try anyway. it's definitely a little big - i would have liked an xs to be an option (5'3"" and 110lbs, for reference). i'm keeping it because it still looks cute, just a little loose through the body."
2296	4	a	Beautiful sweater, very delicate fabric, unique design, but it runs very small. i usually wear a m, but ordered a large based on the previous review hoping that would do the trick. the sizing, along with being long waisted isn't a good combination. unfortunately, i'm returning the sweater.
2297	0	a	I ordered a size down as the reviews suggested and i love them!! they are so cute and snug enough in the calf that i can wear boots with them in winter.  great buy!
2298	4	a	This tank (in black) is nice quality, most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well. it's just too short and too boxy for my figure (curvy/hips). would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted. since that doesn't describe me, it has to go back.
2299	4	a	My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store. this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture. it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter.
2300	4	a	I got this shirt in light blue. i absolutely love it. i just bought it for the summer and i wore it on a day where it was 85 and it was just perfect. it is a very light material and it's very flowy so it breathes very well. i got an xs. i am 5'6 and it fits just perfectly. highly recommend!
2301	2	a	These leggings are very comfortable with a bit of control. i ordered the m and they fit perfectly, as usual i do have to tuck the hem up just a bit but i have to do that with all my leggings. i love the laser cut detail on the side which is a lavender color.
2302	4	a	Wearing this today! it fits true is size & is machine washable. the slits make it unique. don't hesitate to purchase this one.
2303	1	a	"I found this dress to be beautiful. only down side? you'd need to size up two sizes if you have any breasts or butt. i'm usually size s/m in maeve. i bought this in l and looked like a stuffed sausage. i'm 5'1"", 140lbs, 36d, 39"" hips. i'd need an xl."
2304	1	a	Absolutely adore the simplicity and style of this dress. dress is quite flowy, the fabric under the pleats is very soft making is quite comfortable.
2305	1	a	This dress is beautiful and so striking in it's unique design. i ordered a 4, as that is what i usually wear. about halfway up my body i knew it was not even going to zip! i did not even try. i love the fabric and colors so much though that i am going to try a 6. here's hoping it works!
2306	4	a	Saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on. so lovely! i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person. it's like a muted blue that makes it so versatile. the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering. the safety pin is such a unique touch. it's nice and warm, just not super soft, but not scratchy. i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily.
2307	1	a	"This is a gorgeous dress that while it runs quite small ( i normally take a s or xs ). i had to exchange it for a medium. i am 5 4"" and it falls below the knee which is how i like my dresses. it is a gorgeous pattern of color which could be worn for 3 seasons. i look forward to wearing it for many special occasions."
2308	4	a	Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
2309	4	a	"I received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another!  beware because the color names are confusing. i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the ""red"", thinking i'd get the red colored tee. however, the ""red"" tee is actually a light orange color. the ""orange"" tee is actually a burgundy/red color.  i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color, because i really do love the quality of this shirt!"
2310	0	a	Nice jeans, just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them. that's why i returned them. otherwise, fine.
2311	1	a	The dress is  very feminine and very flirty. i love orange/melon-colored dresses. this one does not disappoint. it does run extremely small around the rib cage. i had to size up to a 6 when i typically wear a 2 or 4. my bra size is 32 b. nice quality fabric, lined, with built-in bustier.
2312	0	a	"Ok, so to be honest i just bought these two days ago so as far as wear and tear i'll have to get back to you on that but i seriously think i will just live in these. first they are so so comfortable, soft material, stretchy but not so thin that they accentuate every little curve but also very flattering. i'm 5'4"" 127 lbs, curvy in the bottom with a smallish waist and purchased size 28. there is a little bit of room, which i'm happy with, so they don't squeeze the love handle area or make it unco"
2313	5	a	"Gorgeous flowy dress that's great for three seasons. thank you to the previous reviewers for the fit advice. size small was only available and it fits perfectly on me (i'm an m/l on top). i'm short and will have to hem because even with 3"" heels i kept stepping on the back skirt. bodice opening is wide and gapes too much so i will wear a cami bra or fashion tape or have an additional fastener sewn in. there are bright little balls of red trim and unexpected pops of violet embroidery, adding to t"
2314	4	a	This top fits great. maybe a tad on the large side but not enough to go down a size. i love the fit. the bell sleeves and peplum are so flattering. definitely worth the price too!
2315	4	a	Bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes. had little to no shape to it. some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for. i feel like being short, i just looked kind of dumpy on me. fabric is nice but borders on see through. it was just ok....nothing exciting.
2316	4	a	Yay for the return of shirts that show your form but don't reveal the flaws! i bought this in cream which only seems to be in stores right now. the stripes on the cream version are vibrant and beautiful. the weight of the top is very nice and really hugs your shape. i did think it ran a tad small. i bought the large but also could have worn the medium.
2317	4	a	I love that this tee is so soft and is not boring! when i originally took it out of the bag, my teenage daughter did not like it. then i tried it on and she was wowed! the longer length in the back makes it very interesting. i am looking forward to wearing this with jeans.
2318	0	a	Bought these and they fit really well and are super comfy. love the color. will probably live in them this summer!
2319	1	a	Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting, so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight, the length is a not-too-short above knee, the tiered layers swing so nicely, and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o
2320	1	a	Beautiful dress! vibrant colors. fabric has a nice weight and drapes perfectly. 36 dd up top and the girls have plenty of space.
2321	4	a	This top is beautiful. everything about it is beautiful. it has lovely detail on the back as well as the front. i chose a size 12 which seems to run true. it fit. however, regretfully i had to return the top. i came back here hoping i could find it in ivory or black... but there's only one color. the dusky rose is lovely, but i'm blonde and true pink is fine; this shade not so good, although as someone else here commented, it is a stunning shade of pink, very unusual -- like old dried roses. i l
2322	1	a	"I have the ""charisma sheath"" by the same designer and love it so much i thought i'd try this one. looks so much better in person than in the picture. it's extremely flattering on my curve less frame. whenever i wear it to work, i get stopped and asked where i got it. great dress, you'll love it more in real life!"
2323	5	a	This dress is nice, but it won't do for my purpose. i considered it for a mother of the groom dress, but it's not long enough for me. the dress is pretty, but very sheer and very low cut so it would require opaque undergarments. it's not possible to tell from the pictures how sheer this dress is.
2324	4	a	This general sweatshirt is cute, stylish and can be dressed up or down. a fresh alternative to the standard grey sweatshirt with leggings for casual mornings.
2325	4	a	I bought this top in navy and am so happy with my purchase. it's pretty and feminine. it looks great with jeans as well dressing it up for work. very happy with this purchase.
2326	4	a	This blouse is very unique due to the pretty piped design on the back. looks great with jeans. the front is shorter and more tailored than the back. i love this blouse!
2327	1	a	"Pretty much awesome... i tried it on in regualr size jsut to see, and i could almost get away with it... too bad i dind't try it on before hte 25% of f dresses... (also, i don't have an occasion to wear this).  length is midi, but since it is gathered, i could pull it up a little so it falls in the right spot on me.  color is very nice, overall sexy dress.  material is soft and comfortable, nothing wrong except i missed out on the sale! :-)"
2328	3	a	The rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured. i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket. the print is great, i love it! it's so different than any other jackets ive seen. while the jacket is ã¼ber cute, it is a bit bulky (though the waist tie helps with that) and its not heavy winter appropriate ( it's not waterproof or heavily insulated). for your average winter day though, it will be a fun option! the removable v
2329	4	a	I do not even know where to begin with this product. i ordered a small (i go between small and medium) and felt that would be a good fit. after trying on the shirt, i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is. this shirt is very boxy. i know its supposed to have a 'flow' to it, but this shirt is too much. it needs to be taken in. or have a belt wrapped around it. i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering. i found this color to be very blah. overall, i am slig
2330	1	a	I love this dress! i was trying on some dresses in the store and the sales girl put this one in just for fun. i would have never picked this dress out. i didn't look awesome on the hanger. but i tried it on anyway and i ended up getting two other dresses at that time. but i couldn't stop thinking about how much i loved the way i looked and felt in this dress. so i did what any girl would do and bought it online. it took me a while to find it online because the picture on line doesn't do the dres
2331	4	a	Comfortable & the color was great. just as it looks in the picture. nice design
2332	4	a	Soft and unique. love the sleeves. my usual size medium fits perfectly. per the other reviewer, i guess my bust is large enough for the flowers to be on the side and not directly on breasts! my only wish is that it has some embroidery on it....love!!
2333	4	a	Bought this tank on a whim, but i'm so happy i did! so flattering, comfy and well made.
2334	1	a	"I love the fabric and pattern of this dress so much that i decided to keep it (got it on mega sale), but i would have never paid full price or anything close. the armholes are enormous, showing bra and all. i am not particularly large chested (34c), and the buttons are stretched to gaping on me, even with the huge armholes. i have a cute red sweater coat that i will wear over it all fall, but i could not recommend it because of the poor cut design.  pros: great pattern, fabric, pockets, true to"
2335	1	a	"After reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model. the dress they sent me is not this dress. it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter, like a cross. there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer. it was scoop and if you pulled it down, the neck went up. the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here, is rava. the length measured at 39"" not the st"
2336	2	a	I love this jacket, but in contrast to the other reviewers find it to run a little small. i usually wear a small at retailer and got a size medium as the small was a little tight under the armpits. this might be because i have a large chest, but i wanted more room in case i want to layer.
2337	3	a	Love this kimono. design is bohemian and it will be a great layering piece. can be belted over simple black dress or layered with jeans and boots. almost didn't purchase because of the reviews concerned with fragile material but i didn't find that to be an issue once i felt the garment. great piece for fall.
2338	5	a	This dress is much larger in person than it looks on the model but i absolutley love it! there is an inner tie that helps taper the waist a bit and the material is gorgeous!
2339	4	a	Although seemingly simple, this hooded sweater top is actually versatile. wear with jeans or leggings, even a skirt. wear over a cami, tank or even sleeved top. i do like the delicate nature of this piece and it does appear to be made well enough to be durable. would recommend.
2340	3	a	Perfect fall accessory and transitional piece for cooler days. classic red and black check with a fashion flair. great with jeans or dress it up with jewelry. a great find!
2341	4	a	"Ordered the ""white"" tee, but when it arrived today, i was surprised by how cream it looked.the cut is nice and as other reviewers mentioned, it is on the sheer side. still on the fence of whether or not i'll keep it."
2342	1	a	The dress is very cute, probably more on the casual side. i ordered the 2 petite and it hits me a few inches above the knee, which is what i wanted. the material of the dress and under slip is a little thin, but it looked nice after i ironed it. the top part of the dress looks great and shows off my shoulders nicely.
2343	1	a	Made for a straight figure - no curves. awkward bra situation as it has to be strapless because of the keyhole.
2344	3	a	This was completely different than i expected. the xs/s was so large that it looked messy. unfortunately i had to return it.
2345	0	a	I'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are. i ordered the petite small, and i'm always a small. these are huge. i felt like i had on a large. i like the thin material and color, and i'm sad that they are so large.
2346	1	a	"This dress may not be worth the full price of $138 but on sale it is one huge bargain! so easy to wear and so incredibly flattering! seriously, i don't know why it's not sold out at this price! it hides all flaws without looking oversized or bulky. i totally disagree with the reviewer who called this dress ""sack"" like. found this tts. looks great with pumps or flats."
2347	4	a	This is a comfortable tunic piece with ample rear coverage. it is lightweight and there is room to layer a thin tank top underneath.the ivory is a marled heather with ivory buttons. it is not anything special in terms of style but it will serve the purpose of being a casual separate for around the house or for a quick errand.
2348	1	a	I love the look of this dress but wish the bottom was lined like the top is. it's a little sheer without the lining.
2349	4	a	This top is beautiful. so beautiful that i am keeping it even though it is a little bit large and drapey. the fabric has a golden glow to it. the details in the back are darling. perfect for a romantic dinner out.
2350	4	a	I do like the shape of this piece.  it is eye catching due to the length and flattering.  however, if you are chesty, this piece shows off more than i was comfy with, and i don't think i've ever had that problem with retailer.  in the body, i needed an xs or i would be swimming in it.  but up top, the xs showed much too much cleavage.  (34d, 5', 115).  i'm still keeping it but i have to watch where i wear this.
2351	4	a	This is a nice top but it runs very large. the small was still too large for me. hoping they have this in xs.
2352	1	a	Very flattering! i am petite, but have large breasts. so, i expected this dress to look boxy on me. but the flowy fabric falls perfectly on the body and shows just the right amount of shape. the pattern is beautiful and perfect for the cooler seasons. the dress is also very versatile. it can be dressed up with heels and a jacket, or down with flats and a denim vest or jacket. i know i'm going to wear this dress over and over this fall and winter.
2353	2	a	"I purchased the pink top and really like it. it will be a ""go-to"". the material is light but not skimpy, and it has a nice drape to it. the length is good for me (5'4"") and it fits tts."
2354	4	a	I bought this top in a small and it was true to size. loved that it wasn't too fitted across the back, but was still able to show a bit of body with the drawstring by the waist. it will become a wardrobe staple during the hot months in dallas.
2355	0	a	I like the skirt. that said it is going to the tailor to have some of the fullness taken out. just a lot of material going on, and heavier than you might have imagined. i will wear it fall & winter with white & navy cardigans.
2356	4	a	Chambray top that is soft, but thick/heavy so it drapes well and is very flattering on. untucked, the top is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it hangs like a tunic, almost a-line so do not size up or you will have too much material. i am a sz small in most retailer clothing, and the sz 2 fit nicely. sz 4 was too loose around my arms, and the sz 0 was too tight around my chest. nice neckline and a pop of surprise with the gorgeous lace detail in the back.
2357	3	a	I first saw this jacket hanging at the store and it didn't look very cute. i saw it again on sale so i decided to try it on. i'm so glad i did! the inside gray material is so soft. i have broad shoulders and this jacket did not hinder my arms at all. it is very comfortable. i bought the x-small and was very surprised at how roomy it was. the sleeves are a tad bit long but the gray inner lining has an elastic cuff so it can be pushed up. not sure if the xx-small would've been too small or if the
2358	4	a	I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful, the embroidery is well done, the fabric is soft, and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath, but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.
2359	4	a	"Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges. i'm a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out. it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesn't make the wearer look big; it falls elegantly and in a flattering way.  great, versatile shirt."
2360	4	a	This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of, it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it's shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.
2361	0	a	I ordered these online. i usually wear a 4-6 depending on the brand. i ordered the 6 and love the way they fit as i didn't want them tight. they have a lot of stretch and the fabric is nice quality.
2362	4	a	I love the cut and style of this simple striped tank! it's good fabric
2363	5	a	"I am going to review this pretty much the way the person ahead of me reviewed it. first, the colors are way more vibrant in person than in the photo. there is even a lavender (which you can sort of see under the yellow stripe). it really makes it look different. second, it is monstrously huge. i am 5'3"", 110 pounds and i ordered the xs and it completely swallowed me up. because of the vibrancy of the colors, it didn't blend well with my fair complexion and also, it is like a heavy sweater, not a"
2364	4	a	"Very pretty blouse. it does run quite large, i am usually an xs-s or 0-4 and purchased the 0. i could probably have gone to a 00. for reference i am 5'4"" 118 lbs 34b/c. it says that it is dry clean only, however i washed in in delicate cycle with cold water and threw in the dryer for a little bit. it came out perfect! i was hoping to shrink it and it only shrunk a tiny bit. i was hoping for it to shrink more but it is fine. no need to even iron it! i was lucky enough to get it on sale, i don't t"
2365	4	a	This is a terrific top!  the supima cotton is super-soft; the black, a deep black.  i love that antho is listening, and that it's made in the usa!  the lines and flow are beautiful and flattering.  i bought the medium and am a reliable size 8 top/medium, 34f.  the sleeves are nice and long.  don't miss out on this classic tee, friends!
2366	5	a	"This is a beautiful dress for fall. the fabric is gorgeous and drapey and the skirt is swingy. i ordered this in an xl because that size always sells out first. i think a l might fit a bit better, so i will see if any more come in and order another to compare. it poofs out in the back above the elastic and the waist slides down a bit. it is also very long, i need to hem it about 3-4"". i never know which size to order with this brand, i vary between l and xl."
2367	5	a	This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy, just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.
2368	1	a	Got the petite size. dress is swing style, so extra fabric is expected. can wear a nude bra or strapless. dress is beautiful in person, more so than online. very comfy and stands out without being flashy, just pretty and different. nice silk (matte, not shiny).
2369	0	a	Material is a little think and they run a bit long like many other retailer pants. otherwise, a great deal if you get them on sale.
2370	4	a	I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.
2371	2	a	"This is beautiful and fits perfect. it's even prettier in person, and extremely comfortable and high quality. i'm 5'3"" and it hits right above the knee. the straps are adjustable and fits true to size. i bought an xs and it fits perfect. must buy for a sweet little night gown!"
2372	4	a	The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty, but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest, it was very unflattering.
2373	4	a	I love this blouse! i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on. this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging. i don't live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively. i have larger hips (135lbs, 5'6) and finding flattering tops can be tough. sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on, they just don't look right. some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter. this top looked great a
2374	4	a	I initially bought this in the brown in a small but ended up exchanging it for an xs in ivory. as other reviewers have said, it's not the softest sweater you'll try on. if you want it to lightly hug your body like the way it is on the model, you may need to size down. while i love the style, it feels like the type of material that will get stretched out easily so i've been careful getting it on and off. i picked this up during retailer days and got it on sale. the quality is of the yarn is just of
2375	1	a	This dress was adorable & fit great! regrettably, i had to return it since it wasn't lined.
2376	4	a	"Top is blouse and long enough to stay tucked in if you want.  like the laser cut detail front and back.  sleeveless is great for summer months here.  can wear to work or dress down with jeans.  fit is true to size.  i am 5'5"", slim and small busted so anything fits me.  i would think it you're busty it would be fine as it's a blousy fit. the color is more of a salmon pink which works for me.  however if your looking for a true pink it may not work."
2377	1	a	I thought the design was adorable. i ordered up bc of reviews and i am glad i did. i am a size 6 so i ordered a size 8. the upsize is needed so u can get into the top part of the romper. otherwise it would be mission impossible. it's a pain to get on and off as all rompers are but it's soo cute it's worth it. had compliments on it the first day i wore it.
2378	4	a	I've tried or bought nearly every retailer cashmere sweater this season. this one fits the best and the yellow is a bit darker in person, not quite mustard but a deep rich yellow. i wish they would offer more colors.
2379	4	a	This is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person - a nice mix of modern and artistic, with just enough color and a flattering fit. my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day, especially at the neckline. if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin, i would recommend it for style and fit.
2380	0	a	This skirt was cute on, but not particularly flattering. i thought the denim was a little too stiff. typically, a-lines are flattering on my figure, but this was a miss.
2381	1	a	I ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black. they were not ! they were wine colored. i liked the color, but not in combination with the other colors in the dress. black would have been a better look. i had to take it back. sad...
2382	4	a	I tried this sweater on in-store in grey. from front it appears like a nice, normal sweater, even a little boring. but the side and back are *wow* really fun! the colors and swing of the back material look great, especially with jeans. the front is short, making you wonder if it's supposed to be a crop top. also, the style of the sweater lets isn't very warm because the back is so loose and flowy. i couldn't decide whether to buy it or not. maybe i will wait for a sale.
2383	4	a	I purchased the orange tiger print and absolutely love it! the colors and pattern are rich and vibrant and can easily be dressed up to be worn for work or a night out!
2384	4	a	This fit nicely and i loved the asymmetrical flower design. it is somewhat sheer/see through so i put a tank underneath.
2385	0	a	For some reason, the cream colored cords are sheer. the material is quite thin. you can see the pockets through them, as well as the seams. i have other ag cords and it seems the material they are using this go around is substandard. too bad.
2386	4	a	Great top but it runs smaller than other tops in this brand. the chest and arm area is small. otherwise this top is great. just plan to size up one or two sizes. length was nice. hit right at the waist.
2387	4	a	I bought one of these tees and i washed it a few times and luckily no holes yet like other reviews have stated. i just got a 2nd tee as they are quite comfy. i bought these both in-store but the petite size might have been better for my frame. i wish retailer would look into having petite sizes available in store and not just online. sometimes i do get lucky on finding petite sizes in-store, but it's usually from a return.
2388	4	a	I just tried this top on in xs regular even though i generally wear xspetite in retailer and it fit great (34aa - 26 - 34). i think it's flattering on my fairly straight body with the halter neck, fitted waist and peplum. i would guess it would be flattering on many body types; it highlights shoulders beautifully. it was very hard to get my head through the small, not-too-stretchy opening so you may want to try it on without makeup. i knocked off one star because the neck band wasn't symmetrical,
2389	4	a	I love this top. i bought it in the blue but loved all the colors. i fell in love with it on-line and hesitated ordering it only because i was afraid that the arm holes would be too large (based on what i saw in the picture). fortunately they had it at my local retailer, so i was able to try it on. my usual xs fit perfectly. great flow, soft and casual. perfect for those cool nights in the summer or layered with a cardigan in the winter.
2390	4	a	I love this shirt. the colors are just as depicted. the material is gorgeous and the top is very flattering. fits true to size for retailer small (i'm normally a medium outside of this store).
2391	4	a	"This blouse is very versatile. it can be worn with jeans or dress pants. great fall color.  it is very sheer and you will need to wear something under it. it's pretty in person with an original print design."
2392	0	a	I love these pants! they really make you look and feel classy. i also bought the feather tank and absolutely love this outfit! it is flattering, beautiful and oh so comfy! true to size,
2393	0	a	I have 7 pair of pilcro denim shorts from retailer and for some reason the colored ones (white, yellow, pink) hold their shape but the denim blue completely stretch out. i went down a size in these and they still stretch to the point of sagging. i really want the black ones...hoping they don't do it too.
2394	4	a	I wish they would have shown this belted as it is beyond striking if you slip you belt thru the top of the slit.under the fabric and bring thru the front belting only the front leaving the back full...stunning and chic! because of the colors this will be incredible in the fall...i plan to wear with all my on trend overalls and booties...madly in love with it. i am certain if all these 1 star reviwes played with it in the fashion they too would have given 5 stars. the knit is beautiful and again
2395	4	a	This was a really nice, soft lightweight sweater, perfect for transitioning into fall. i found it to be a tad boxy and while i love a high/lo hem, it was a little short in the front for my liking. i'm still debating if i'm keeping it since i bought it full price, but the color was really pretty and on sale, i would def. go for it. for reference, i got a large since i normally like my clothes more loose.
2396	4	a	This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldn't work for my body. i'm athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it's just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn't busty and has slender upper arms.
2397	4	a	This top runs large for sure and reminds me more of a tunic due to the length. nice detailing around neck and sleeves and the paisley print on the side hems is super cute. size down!
2398	0	a	I am 5.1 and 113lbs. i ordered the petite size 26 and it fits like a glove. i gave 4 starts as i wish i had less stretch in it but other than that they are perfect length and sooo soft. super happy with the cut and waist height!
2399	4	a	"This is absolutely adorable and so flattering! i have the patterned shirt, and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much. i am 5 ft. 9"" and 155 lbs. and the medium fits nicely. hope this helps!"
2400	2	a	I was hesitant to purchase since this price is expensive for a tank, but the quality and true shimmery-ness are worth it. it fits very well and goes with many different sweaters. very happy with my purchase!
2401	1	a	I saw this dress online, and i thought it was perfectly cute! however, once i tried it on at home, it just didn't work. one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning, and once i got it on, the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm. (i'm 5'7'' and ~126 lbs and purchased in size 2). i didn't even try buttoning all the way. i took it back, and i don't even think i want a larger size. the buttons are just too fragile.
2402	5	a	"This dress us high quality and feels great, however i am 5'5"" and it is too long for me. will definitely need to shorten but love it, not above knee as pictured for a non supermodel!"
2403	1	a	This dress makes me feel like the princess of fall. it is very slimming. the colors are much brighter in real life. they look pastel here but are more pronounced. love this dress!
2404	2	a	Velvet always has made quality clothing and i had purchased the same shirt in another color and i wanted to see if they had other colors, they did and i got 2 more. i received in expected time and they were wrapped nicely. thank you for great choices of unique clothing.
2405	0	a	Love these jeans. wish i could snag another pair because the fit is just on point, as is the wash. the side slit at the ankle really looks great with heels. a definite buy.
2406	1	a	Dress fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable. great for day or evening. love it!,
2407	2	a	I purchased the teal suit and it was so beautiful! it's super comfortable and has nice coverage. i decided to return it because, as a nursing mom i've decided to wait until i've weaned the baby so i can make sure the fit is still good. but otherwise i would have kept it!
2408	4	a	Beautiful top marred only by the armholes. i tried a small and a medium but alas, my bra showed under the arms. i my be overly endowed for this top, but the way it cuts, you would have to be braless to wear it. not for me, but wish it worked. it is really pretty.
2409	4	a	"This is a beautiful top, but it runs large. i am exchanging for one size smaller. it is worth the effort of exchanging! well made, beautiful lace."
2410	0	a	Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit, more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.
2411	4	a	Love this tee! the fit is true to size, and very flattering shaping. not too tight, not too baggy, good length. i love the stitching detail on the top. the material is thick enough that you are not forced to wear a cami under it. my only concern is that it says to hand wash, dry clean acceptable. i have had some bad luck with retailer tops shrinking. i'm not going to risk it and dry clean it. normally i would not want that expense or hassle.
2412	4	a	Great fit, very soft fabric, and the sleeves are long enough!! great length in the body too.
2413	1	a	"As soon as i saw this dress i ordered it...i didn't want to miss out on it. i loved the look...the colors were so fun and bright...i thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii. i am 5'4"" about 118#. i ordered a pxs. when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric. i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful. part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c"
2414	1	a	The fabric is beautiful, the embroidery quite striking, and the length is perfect. however, the dress is a bit amorphous; and as others have mentioned, the sleeves are silly. so i took the dress to my favorite seamstress, and she added a couple of darts in the back and fixed the sleeves - voila!. these weren't expensive fixes, and now the dress is perfect.
2415	1	a	"This one is a beauty! my store is not carrying the white - they had a lovely blue (periwinkle-ish) that immediately caught my eye. the ivory model shot makes the details of the lace and top layer really pop - more so than the blue variety but both are stunning. the details and layers on this dress are lovely and intricate without feeling overly delicate. quality most definitely in line with the price.   fit: 130lbs/34c/5'6"" high waist. i'm a 4 or 6 at retailer depending on the brand. in most mou"
2416	4	a	Only worn this once but had multiple compliments! such a cute pattern and style. only complaint is wish they would have done the sides with a split. it kind of wants to hug the hips and then be too wide in the middle. still, love it!
2417	4	a	This is a beautiful, light-weight summer top. i ordered the white - perfect for summer. very feminine. true to size. i am 117 5'3 34b and the x-small fit perfectly.
2418	2	a	Love these soft cozy leggings. fit like a glove. perfect for weekends, lounging, sleeping during cold winter weather. want more of the same!
2419	4	a	"I agree with the other reviewer-- this is classic retailer old-style quality. the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical. the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist. i usually choose s/m in cardigans (for ref, 5'8"", 135 lbs, 34-b), but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me. i think it just depends what you are looking for. unique it is, and certainly lovely."
2420	1	a	Bought this to wear to desert trip this weekend when we see the stones, dylan, mccartney, who, roger walters and neil young. think its the perfect outfit as it definitely has an 80's feel, now if only i had a pair of brown or teal boots, it would be perfect. i'll keep hunting~
2421	1	a	"I've never been so bummed a dress didn't work for me. this is so cute. i love that it's got a bit of a sleeve. it's one of those easy, pop-it-on-and-go pieces i'd love to have in my closet. i'm 5'2"" and i tried on a 6p in the store and it was prefect except for the bust. the elastic peaked in the front and i can't imaging this dress working on anyone with more than a b cup. (i'm a d and it looked ridiculous in the bodice). i tried on a 6, and the proportions were all off. if the elastic went str"
2422	1	a	As with other maeve dresses, the fit is great. i love the empire waist with stud details. the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip. i'm not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything. when i first saw this online, i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online. however, only the smallest size had the great snake on the back
2423	1	a	Just got this dress in an xl. i've never ordered from retailer before so i expected their clothes to run small. i was wrong. it's a beautiful high quality dress but i think it's just too big. i may end up exchanging it for a l. definitely size down in this dress!
2424	4	a	"This shirt is stunning- definitely a shirt for special occasions. it's more than i would normally pay for a top, but it is a really special piece of clothing. the fit is slim- i'm 5'6"" and 118 pounds. i typically wear an xxs or xs in retailer clothes. the xxs is just right. it is quite sheer, so i imagine i will wear a nude tank top underneath."
2425	1	a	I wanted to like this so much. it's a great good girl dress, church dress. however, it makes no sense. it's a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags i'm petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide.
2426	4	a	I don't normally write reviews, but i love this shirt!  it's sooo soft and hangs perfectly. not to mention it takes what could be a boring t-shirt and makes it anything but that with the cute flutter sleeves. it's beyond comfortable. i purchased one and went back immediately to get another! i can tell these will be some of my go-to tees. plus, they are a steal on sale!  i am 5'5, 135 and medium is perfect.
2427	1	a	"Wow, i didn't think this dress would work on my curvy frame. i still have a baby belly and some dresses look like mumu's on me. this was so flattering, the waist cinches nicely and the length is just above the knee. i am 5.6"" and 145lbs for reference. the weight its light/cottony and it looks great with flats and wedges.  love it!"
2428	1	a	Thanks to the vertical stripes, the adjustable neckline, the bow that cinches the waist, and the free flowing skirt, this dress is extremely flattering. the compliments i received when wearing this dress back that up! i was unsure if i should order a medium or large because i typically wear either/or depending on the dress style due to my hips. i ordered a large which fit thanks to the adjustable neckline and adjustable waist, but a medium definitely would have worked just as well for me (i just
2429	4	a	"Great sweater. long and warm, but not too thick. i am 5'4"" and ordered a medium. fits and hangs nicely."
2430	4	a	"This top hit at my hips not as it appears on the model in the photo, and i am short at 5' 2"". cute top, but shorter than i had expected and definitely not a tunic style."
2431	4	a	I thought it was going to be so pretty. it is ugly on. the macrame is thick, stiff and rough. the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless. yuk!
2432	0	a	Great skirt, easy to wear. perfect weight for spring/fall. very comfortable while still looking stylish. the xs fit well.
2433	4	a	This top is true to size, although i am a little nervous about washing it... hopefully it won't shrink. it is super think so great for hot days but because it's so thin, i'll be careful. i have white and am def. going to get more colors. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small. i think medium might cut to low in the v, but haven't tried it yet, let's just say if it shrinks after washing i will get a medium...
2434	1	a	"I love this dress. it's adorable and great for summer with a unique style- it's a bit unusual with the high and slightly ruffled neck. it can easily be dressed up or worn more casually. this is the most flattering dress i've found this season (particularly around the stomach area). i'm 5""3' and took a petite size, which fit perfectly. this dress is a bit translucent, so skin-toned undergarments are a must."
2435	4	a	It's really crazy how much i like this sweater. i am surprised by the weight of the sweater. it is a medium-light weight that will be appropriate year round. it fits perfectly and is very flattering open or zipped. i will wear this as a stand alone top with a tank underneath for now and in place of a spring jacket when the weather is warmer. this is a nice find.
2436	2	a	I ordered a small and i'm usually always a small. i could not zip it up. i'm am returning it for a large, and this is concerning because what if it is big in a weird way because i'm usually a large?
2437	4	a	Super cute top! thin!! would look great layered! not crazy how it looked by itself!
2438	1	a	I saw this dress online and thought it might be an adorable eclectic piece to add to my closet. and was i right. the simple shape mixed with the bold pattern make this dress an awesome one to own. its easy and fun and funky. plus it has hidden pockets! beware though this dress seems to run a bit small. i would say if you switch in between sizes like me i can be a 6 or an 8 then possibly go with the larger size. i do have a large bust as well i wear a 34ddd so it shows some clevage but the girls
2439	4	a	The fit of this top on me was much more boxy than on the model, maybe the fault of my fuller bust. my usual small definitely didn't reach my hips as it does hers, and appears wider. i'm not even sure the v is as deep! again, could be me. but i'm keeping the top because it is just so darn comfortable. as for not looking too top-heavy, ill just have to make it work.
2440	4	a	I am normally an xs or s in tanks, so ordered the size 6. looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love that it's a cotton denim but it doesn't have any stretch. love the look & the fabric, but the neck area feels slightly restrictive in the front & i think it wld creep up & pull on me when wearing. fabric is slightly stiff & the flared bottom just sticks out. armholes do cover the bra & length hits at the top of the hips on me. going to return the 6, but will try the 8 if the local store has it.
2441	4	a	Although the fabric and color is beautiful,  the sleeves do not lay properly. they are too stiff and look like wings on me. sadly i must return. the quality looks great. it is unfortunate that the design was a miss.
2442	4	a	This was a nice surprise because it's a thick sweatshirt type of fabric. don't be deterred! it is nothing like a sweatshirt. it's comfy like a sweatshirt though. i'm 5 feet tall 120 pounds. i ordered my usual size petite small and it fit perfectly. what little height i have is in my torso. i didn't find that the top was short at all. it's without a doubt tts. order your usual size. if you have a tummy or bootie this top is the ticket! the description on the fabric details that the other reviews
2443	5	a	Fantastic quality. i agree the material is heavier and may be too hot for summer in sc but will be perfect for ac cooled offices. the fit is tts. i am smaller on top than the bottom and size 2 fit well everywhere thanks to the somewhat stretchy material, 32-24-36. i never write reviews but this dress really is fantastic and at a great price point given the high quality of the fabric and design. i couldn't tell from the pics but the back bottom is not a single center slit but a double slit. i rea
2444	5	a	I was excited to try something by this designer and decided to order size large. unfortunately, this top just looked very odd. cute from the front but it wings out in the back where the sleeves meet the arms. the fabric makes an odd poof in that area. i do have a large bust and it didn't pull anywhere in the front. i expected it to be soft and drapey but the cotton feels very coarse and doesn't drape well. it covered my behind in back. unfortunately it made me look wide from the side view. i hav
2445	4	a	"I was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand, but i'm a little unsure. the front part hangs a bit too low on my 5'4"" frame, yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides. i'm just not sure it hangs right on me. it's fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely, and looks great with the front loosely tucked. just not what i was expecting."
2446	4	a	This top runs large. i am a 34 d and usually a medium or small. the medium was a little loose in the bust, but incredibly loose and swingy in the waist. my figure was lost in the fabric. the small was too small for me in the bust, although the waist looked more flattering. the coral color was lovely and bright and not too sheer.
2447	0	a	There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine, but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back, especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped, but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.
2448	1	a	I was a little surprised when i received this dress, as it is little more than an a-line tube with elastic casing at the top and a cute knotted detail at the bust. i guess i expected the bust to be lined at least. it is unlined, and a relatively thin jersey knit. it wasn't see through, for it is black, but i expected a heavier fabric. i would never have paid full price for this, but at the sale price it is very cute and comfortable. it is also flattering and the fit is true to size. the a-line t
2449	4	a	I have received so many compliments. it's my favorite
2450	3	a	"Super cute. 5'9"" 135 lbs and the medium was perfect to wear with a long sleeve shirt underneath. good quality and lined too. perfect for daytime when a leather moto might be a bit much."
2451	1	a	"This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on. great quality, fabric was lovely, just a little sparkle at the hemline, scallops were great but i put it on, i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return. love the look, it just was terrible on me. i'm petite, 5'0"" and weigh 110# so i'm not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa."
2452	4	a	I loved the contrast of the front panels and sleeves/back of this sweater. it has a coat look with the ease of a sweater. the arms seem very long and i wish i went with an xs as where i live not much laying is needed. but overall this is a lovely sweater!
2453	0	a	"Around 5 years ago, i bought 4 pairs of ""daughters of the liberation"" brand (very similar style) shorts at retailer, and have been repairing any and all frayed fabric in the first two pair, in a lighter material than the second two pair, ever since, in order to preserve my #1 favorite shorts. thank goodness pilcro - another longtime fave brand of pants available at retailer - came through this year with these very similar, but perhaps even nicer, shorts. i bought the yellow striped pai"
2454	2	a	I was apprehensive because of the long tail at the back of this shirt, but it is very pretty with capris.
2455	4	a	"I agree with the other reviewers, this top is completely disappointing in every way, i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin,....... it runs really big it's short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture. colors are completely dull in person, i really think this picture was lightened a great deal. fabric feels cheap and stiff lining is stuff and poorly sewn. i haven't one positive thing to say about t"
2456	5	a	"This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb, 5'-4"", 36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern, color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent, lol. also, the back is slightly longer than the front, something i couldnt see from the pictures online."
2457	1	a	This dress fits like a dream and looks gorgeous on. i'm sure it will be a go to for many occasions.
2458	0	a	These pants are so comfy and perfectly casual without being sloppy. they're the perfect summer pants.
2459	4	a	This is such a cool top/sweater. i like simple designs with a twist and the sleeves add that. great with skinnies and heels
2460	1	a	I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two.
2461	4	a	"I'm a sucker for anything in rich velvet tones and fabric :) the retailer i visited only had the dark blue top.  _____________  it is tts and hangs nicely on the body, even for gals with longer backs. there was no issue of see-through with the blue (hopefully the pink is the same) due to the dark color and thicker material. the sides are a tad see-through, but only at the cap sleeves! the rest is well lined.  my only complaint is the v-cut at the chest; it's entirely too low for my liking. every t"
2462	0	a	I love these jeans! perfect amount of stretch without sag. great color.  ordered my usual size 28. i wish they had these in olive and black!
2463	4	a	Retailer sizes are all over the place. i fell in love with this top, and tried it a couple of times to see if it would work. unfortunately i have to send it back. the design and colors are very good. the side slits are very high, right up to the waist, but the top still looks good. unfortunately it is very small. it still fits because of the long side slits, and is not that tight at the top due to sleeveless, but the fit just wasn't as flattering. it does seem to run 1-2 sizes small, so i a
2464	1	a	I loved the look of this dress online, so i was excited to order it, but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be. i thought the material would be more lacy, but it seemed pretty cheap. there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory, but it made the material poof out just under the waist, making me look like i had a belly. no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat. returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead, which
2465	4	a	Beautiful lightweight cardigan. the sheerness is really pretty. ordered one for my sister too!
2466	0	a	"These literally are more comfortable than sweatpants. they are definitely ""relaxed"" and look a little baggier on than in the photo, but still cute and flattering."
2467	5	a	The top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy.  it also feels cheap to the touch.  i love the idea but can't keep it for this price...i'm a shorty so i'd have to hem it too! sadly will return.
2468	0	a	I am so glad i did not miss out on these jeans. i am new to pilcro and am finding they fit me so well!
2469	1	a	I like this dress because it's the perfect shape on me and i think the design is modern and cute. i got the red and i really like the pattern and the subtle tulle edging. the material is a little stretchy and substantial and there's also a lining. i wore it with little booties like the model and tights and a cropped moto jacket and loved the outfit. i am short, small chest, but somewhat broad shouldered, the empire waist would not work on larger chested women with hourglass figures.
2470	4	a	Please be awate that although this blouse is beautiful and the color is gorgeous--it is completely sheer!!! it just doesn't match up with the price point,
2471	1	a	"Such a cute dress but it runs large. i'm 5'4"" 130 lbs and am typically a size 4 can wear a size 2 in certain clothes. i tried on the xs and it was still too big. i would of bought it in an xxs but they are sold out. really a comfy laid back dress that would be comfortable in summer. if they get more xxs i'll buy it."
2472	4	a	Love this gorgeous off the shoulder top! very comfortable and stylish. you can wear it either off the shoulder or not!
2473	1	a	I agree, this dress runs long, but since i love high heels, it falls just right for me. it does seem quite roomy for a medium, which is a pleasant surprise. the fabric, drape and quality are contemporary but i know i'll be wearing this beyond this year for sure.
2474	1	a	This dress is a staple. if you don't feel like getting too dressed up and want to be comfortable. this is it. will be great for travel as well. i like to pack light. so i look forward to traveling with this dress.
2475	1	a	I love this dress! high quality dress in a classic style. the cotton eyelet detailing is my favorite part and really elevates this from just another black dress. it is a swing silhouette (as described in the product description) so there is a little more volume than a regular dress, but that's what makes it fun and breezy! great dress, can't wait to wear it when it gets a little warmer.
2476	4	a	This is a darling white top. the juxtaposition of the simple front and the beautiful lace back makes this a unique piece. definitely size down.
2477	2	a	I absolutely adore this top! it is super soft. i purchased it in the wine color. i would recommend this for anyone! if they have other colors i plan on buying them. i am going to wear this with jeans and my furry vest in the fall/winter.
2478	1	a	I got it in tangerine. beautiful, soft material, very flattering and cute dress. i am petite, so i will have to do some alterations to make the top port shorter, but other than that it's a perfect dress.
2479	2	a	It runs large but thats okay, its great quality and super super soft! i love the way it makes you feel so comfortable. very disappointed the clip fell off.
2480	3	a	It is a beautiful coat, runs small. arms feel tight, i am typically xs, i can't even button it up. bottom is skirted, and falls beautifully. it is light weight coat, not really fit for cold weather.
2481	0	a	Love these pants. the design is totally different and that is what i love! i paired these with the velvet red shoes from this site - also on sale. for me these ran true to size.
2482	2	a	"I purchased this in the black and received it today.  it is silky feeling and is a quality camisole.  the color is a muted black, not all shiny as some silks are (and they often look cheap) but this looks great and could be worn alone, under leather, or with a sweater/kimono.  i usually wear a medium in tops, and this fit true to size.  i am 5'2"" and it doesn't look too long, but i do wish it came in a petite.  still keeping it!"
2483	0	a	"I am so happy with this jumpsuit! it is the perfect comfortable and casual summer outfit. the fabric is super soft. i was unsure about the length at first because it's shorter than my other jumpsuits, but if you scrunch up the bottom of the legs and add some sandals, it's a great look.  highly recommend!"
2484	2	a	Love this hoodie. i bought a large to fit bigger on me and it works well. love the color and embroidery.
2485	4	a	Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife, but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.
2486	0	a	"It's a pretty, low-key, no fuss skirt. i prefer the ivory color because the details are more visible (there are different designs in the same hue). the zipper is very thick and sturdy, a bonus. size 2 regular fit me well, the hem falls right above my knees (i'm 5'2"", 26 waist, 36 hips), perfect for work and play. a touch of linen keeps the fabric cool for summer, but it doesn't wrinkle. for the price and the name like ""thera,"" i expect more flair to match its mediterranean name. for those who do"
2487	1	a	"This dress looks great on...feminine and swishy! color is bright and the underslip is nicely attached, which i appreciate...no fighting with straps, etc. i ordered a six for my 5'4"", 130 lb, 34dd self and it fits like a dream. the extra 5 lbs i support with lots of food is on my tummy, just to give you an idea of my shape."
2488	4	a	"When i ordered this all the petite sizes were no longer available. i tried the xs. it was actually a nice length for me (5'4"") and even the arm openings were not too large which is a plus. i expected all the extra flow and material on the back of the tunic but there was too much fabric on the front too...very unflattering. if it had been a closer fit on the front i probably would have kept it. the color is very nice but the fabric is pretty standard...nothing that makes it stand out. it is very"
2489	4	a	This didn't work for me. it looks better unzipped. the piece made me look extremely top heavy, and i am by no means overweight, but i do have a larger chest on a small frame (36c, 5 feet, 115). honestly, it just made me look fat. the design is cute, but this is going back..
2490	4	a	I'm 5'2, 105lbs and bought xsp. seems a bit too short for my taste especially since this is a popover, but not bad enough to return. everywhere else fits tts. nothing stunning about it, but is unique enough to add to my everyday casual. it would be better if there are more colors to choose from.
2491	0	a	I absolutely adore this skirt! sadly it was a lot of skirt for me- i'm 5 feet nothing and it would have been too much fabric to hem. wish this skirt came in a petite size. great color and a fun option for the fall wedding season!
2492	4	a	"I love this sweater! it is true to size and not itchy at all. i am 5'5"" and i bought the small. other reviews said it wasn't as long as it looks pictures but it is the same length on me as it shows on the model. you can wear this with so many things! i can't wait for fall so i can wear it."
2493	2	a	"I have this suit in the ""tile"" pattern and i love it. i am a breast cancer survivor and this suit is perfect for as it covers a little issue i have on the left. so i ordered the ""mint"" pattern. the colors are beautiful but the pattern is off. the ""v"" pattern on the front is not centered. as a result, my body looks a little lop-sided. i looked carefully at the suit on the model and noticed it was slightly off center on her also. however my suit is quite a bit off-center. it's too bad, because the"
2494	1	a	"Cute, easy fitting dress. i got it in orange, which is a summery, pretty print. i ordered it in petite because i am 5'1"", but the dress is very short, so i'm exchanging it for a regular size. if you're average height, be aware that the dress will be well above the knee."
2495	4	a	I purchased this in the cream/beige color and love that it will go with everything. i can add details with long necklace or scarf-even a belt but it also stands alone and looks great with leggings or skinny jeans. i would also wear with a neutral skirt as shown on model. the fabric is not too thin and with a bit of cashmere will also add some warmth. it may shed some depending if you wear a nylon cami underneath. i purchased the xs, my usual size and fits great. 5'8-slender. love my purchase!
2496	0	a	My only problem with the skirt was the length - it appears shorter in the pictures, and i can't take it up since it would mess up the front slit. i would have returned for the petite, but it was not available in the green color which i loved. even though the length is longer than i usually wear, i get non-stop compliments on the skirt. and, it's very versatile.
2497	0	a	These chinos fit great! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear. i bought all 3 colors!
2498	4	a	"I bought this top in the brown /white combo although i really wanted the red /white but haven't had any luck finding it. i am never sure of my size in retailer but run anywhere from small to large depending on brands. i'm 5'4"", 140, 34 ddd. i wish other reviewers would state their sizes to help others purchase.. i got this shirt in size 8 which usually never happens to me. i wear a white tank or cream cami underneath since it is very sheer and dips low at the cleavage area. it is still flowy but n"
2499	1	a	I absolutely love this dress! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments. i have also worn it over leggings, and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals. even though the material is somewhat thin, i did not have to wear a cami with it. the fabric pattern is really cute!
2500	3	a	Really nice, substantial, fully lined sweater coat. i love the structured look and the faux-leather piping around the zipper and the pockets. quality seems to be very good. it runs true to size, maybe slightly on the small side (especially for larger hips/busts) so if you are in between sizes, go up. i chose small and it's just right; i wouldn't be able to zip around my hips with xsmall. besides the price, which is why i dropped one star, i cannot really find any fault in this sweater coat.
2501	3	a	Got this on a whim and boy i'm very pleased! it's flattering and the material is perfect for spring weather. size up as mentioned by other reviewers.
2502	1	a	I ordered this dress in two colors and i'm happy that i did!  very cute and great fit!  flattering too!
2503	4	a	This t is a beautiful color, and i wish it had worked. it is quite flimsy, however - very thin cotton fabric, without the nice drape that would have made this look good on. i also think it should have been cut a little longer; it flares out right at the hips,so instead of covering them, it highlights them. i'm disappointed, and am returning it.
2504	4	a	Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front
2505	4	a	I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps, which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps, so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h
2506	1	a	Flattering, flowy, comfortable. the back strops have elastic so easy on and off. flows when you walk, the ties have two different types of black fabric, matching knit on one side, a matte crepe on the other. love the pockets, very versatile piece.
2507	1	a	I love the color and the style, however it doesn't look as well as the model as i don't have a small waist like the model does. still overall, i love this dress and it is well made and comfortable
2508	3	a	I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants.
2509	1	a	"Loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape.  looks great on. the tie in front adds to the dress.   i love to wear with tan knee-high boots."
2510	1	a	"I am 5'3"" 130 and curvy and this dress fit me perfectly. it's great for parties and weddings (depending on how formal). the only reason i gave it four stars is because the fabric is a little strange; the ribbing for the squares is almost like a pillowy fabric, and it feels a little bit on the cheaper side but luckily it doesn't look cheap. nonetheless, i love this dress and would definitely recommend!"
2511	0	a	Kicky looking pants, that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight, boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice, fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids, but i guess i lied.
2512	1	a	"This is my new favorite dress. while elegant it isn't too fancy for a nice office environment. very comfortable and a perfect size fit. i would like it if it was in petite only to make it hit above my knee, not below since i am 5' 3"" but not a big deal. everyone has complimented this dress!"
2513	0	a	"I love the fabric, since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance. this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric. the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down)."
2514	4	a	Love this top! i'm 5' 118 lbs, purchased in a medium and plan on wearing it as a dress! it is so cute!
2515	2	a	Nice quality, but enough material for two sets of tights. can scrunch up at the bottom for a different look.
2516	4	a	This is a lovely cardigan--especially over dresses with leggings, over-the-knee socks, and boots. i was so ecstatic to get it at the black friday price. the description says its white but it's more like a cream. it was for this reason that i initially reconsidered the purchase. i was hoping for more of an off-white or winter white as it appears on the model. except, it looked so great over dresses and suitable for the southern california winter. i didn't care for the wrap belt. it just looked li
2517	1	a	This dress stunning for the hourglass figure. the hips may be a little narrow. i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best. i read some reviews that said the hips were snug. it's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering. shoulders are a little loose, and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest. i'm 5'4, 32dd, waist 27 and 130 lbs.
2518	4	a	I got this top in white and it is cute. the fabric is a weird kind of polyester, and kind of shiny. i got the medium and it pulls a little around the chest. overall i like it.
2519	4	a	I tried this on in the store. the embroidery is very nice and the shirt is very flattering. however, because of all the stitching, the shirt is a bit stiff on top. there is not much give. i am also concerned that after washing it, it will look terrible, so i passed.
2520	2	a	I am a true to size 4 and when this bathing suit arrived it looks like it's a kids 4. i will exchange for an 8 and hope for the best. the quality looks great and the styling is beautiful but i could barely get into the suit.
2521	0	a	I really love this pant. ordered online and they fit well. they're cute, edgy with the fray at the bottom. corduroy material. awesome!
2522	4	a	"Nice fabric, great color, would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves, take a pass--too much like maternity wear, and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up ""is she or isn't she"" kind of way."
2523	1	a	"Love love love this dress! have received so many compliments on it. i'm 5'4"", 118 and xs fit perfectly. love the cap sleeves and details, super comfortable too. i can see wearing this year-round and dressing it up/down."
2524	1	a	I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress, i'm dissapointed.
2525	0	a	"Oh wow no. as the previous reviewer said, much lighter than the picture! rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe? the fit is true to size, i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum (waist 28/29, hips 36, usually a 27 or 28 in jeans, sometimes even a 29 if they're super skinny)."
2526	4	a	I love this sweater, so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color, it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party.  i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.
2527	4	a	This shirt has such a fun twist on an otherwise basic jean shirt! i bought this shirt on a whim despite having a closet full of denim shirts... and i'm glad i did! the fabric is the same cloth
2528	4	a	Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric, it's very scratchy.
2529	4	a	I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however, the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.
2530	4	a	I stalked this blouse and when the price dropped, i pounced on the black. sadly, it did nothing for me. i'm a large, sometimes medium, but decided on the large. you'd think it came with its own cami at this price, but no. completely sheer. unwearable without one. the lace is nothing special. the collar is wider in the back, uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front. the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back. i'm returning this one.
2531	4	a	This tunic is way over priced for the style and quality. it fit comfortably (runs a size larger) but it's not really flattering, it jut kind of hangs there looking ok. it is a little too deep of a v cut for a work top as well. this top does not support the price at all. it felt like something i could find at department store for way less. i will be returning it.
2532	0	a	I could live in these. they are so comfy. i typically wear a 6 and got the medium. they are a little roomy. probably could have gotten a small..but i like them kinda loose and baggy. i will probably purchase another color!
2533	2	a	It looks a little more dressy in the picture but it's cotton, soft and very comfortable.
2534	4	a	This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all, the armhole is way too low! second, there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper, it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.
2535	1	a	I love my blue dress, i'm a pear shape to the top fit fine on me. i know reviewers complained that the top was too tight, not so on me. it was also not sheer on me because it has a cotton lining underneath. got a lot of compliments!
2536	1	a	"Fit is ""breezy"" which is what i expected. a little on the loose side but comfortable and still cute. the slip that accompanies the dress is of decent quality as well.  the back of the dress is not that much longer than the front, as in the picture, but i still liked the dress enough to keep it."
2537	4	a	This boiled wool jacket is warm and cozy. it does run a little big. i have to fold the sleeves twice! but it looks great and i got compliments immediately.
2538	4	a	Very sheer inexpensive material. even on sale i'm returning it
2539	1	a	I saw this dress in the lilac at the store and loved it immediately! the picture on the website does not do it justice.
2540	4	a	Love this t-shirt! i live in miami and have a 5 month old so i practically live in shorts and t-shirts, and this shirt fits beautifully and adds a little extra pop to your everyday t. love the material too!
2541	4	a	"I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it. so many people compliment it. i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up (obviously with a statement necklace too). but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down. the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink (which i hope it doesn't because it is one of my favorite pieces).   unlike the other reviewer i did not think that the"
2542	4	a	I agree with the other reviews, this top runs large so size down. with that being said, this is a beautiful top, love it!
2543	5	a	I would have liked it but it was too small for me.
2544	5	a	It is polyester but seems good quality. looks like a girls nightgown with the pattern combined with the baby doll dress silhouette and the overall width of the dress. i usually wear a small but, to look like it does on the model, 6-8 inches would have to go in the width.
2545	0	a	The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it, and was mostly white, yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.
2546	1	a	More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid
2547	4	a	The small is huge on me and the sweater is very itchy. cute idea but not for me. i will return it.
2548	4	a	This is a great staple for laid back weekend wardrobe. the inside of the pullover is soft, like sweatshirt material, and its comfortable enough to sleep in. also cute enough to wear out with jeans. i would definitely recommend this sweatshirt. i'm typically a size 0 in retailer - i ordered this shirt in a size 1 and i love the fit.
2549	0	a	I am so happy i ordered this jumpsuit. it is exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. the fabric is light and it's very well made. great length for dressing up with heals or dressing down with flats. i love it!
2550	1	a	I'm usually an xs for most retailer dresses and shirts. i ordered up per other reviews and got a small. the small fits comfortably around my waist. the chest area is not made for large chests. my 34ds were barely contained. sad to say, i won't be keeping the dress. the layers, fabric, and colors are truly pretty but the design/fit is disappointing.
2551	4	a	I absolutely love everything about this top! i bought it in the taupe/navy stripes version and got compliments the first time i wore it. i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all, but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer. the neckline and sleeves seem tailor-fitted for my body. i don't often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect length/shape to be incredibly flattering. they're in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regular-length. the neckline is eq
2552	4	a	I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7, flat chested, 135 pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer, because i do not consider myself tall.
2553	0	a	And this one has a heavenly feel to it. i know it's not 100% cashmere, but it's soft and cozy. i love the understated colors and plan to wear it with a neutral/creme sweater. perfect to take from fall into winter.
2554	2	a	While the print is cute, the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra, more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully, if retailer continues to do swimwear, they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)
2555	1	a	The print was what attracted me to this dress. and the material is soft and comfortable. however, the fit was all wrong for me. it had a great belt in the back, but hung very loosely in the front. it reminded me a little of some of my maternity dresses. maybe sizing down would have helped, but then i feared it wouldn't fit my hips right. this dress may look better on someone who isn't as curvy. it really looks great on the model, but not on me.
2556	4	a	This tank is very loose fitting, which i can understand would make some think it runs large. taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps, i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted. i love the draped styling, which i also think makes sense with the pattern. it's an easy top too...just throw on and go. and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest.
2557	3	a	Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather.
2558	0	a	"I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular size 27 (5'4"", 27/35, 116bs) and they fit me just perfect so they are tts. they are super soft and there's just enough stretch in these that i'm able to bend easily yet they retain their shape nicely. the pockets in the front are super cute in person and the back gives a really cute look. the color is just as shown in the picture, a nice shade of blue that's in the middle plus they are really incredibly soft. i'm only 5""4"" but found the regular"
2559	4	a	Great, special cardigan. fits like a shrug and a little short but is perfect over a tight fitting sheath. great for broad shoulders.
2560	4	a	These are long, easily wear with skinny jeans, they do not cling and are not see through! the colors are great!
2561	4	a	This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size, however, it's just not long enough on me to be a top, which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts, it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still
2562	1	a	Great fabric. soft and easy to wear and goes from day to night easily.
2563	4	a	I ordered this shirt in the grey/blue color choice; the creamy grey is perfectly heathered and the blue silk-like bottom is a classy touch. the fit of this shirt in the arms, torso, and back was flattering with a little room to drape. love it!
2564	0	a	These pants are so cute and flattering. the linen is substantial and the quality of the tailoring is very good. i typically wear a 26p, but they were sold out in the gray color, so i tried the 25p and they fit perfectly. this tells me that they run just a little big, at least in the petite sizing. i wish the rose color was available in petite. i am considering ordering the chocolate as well.
2565	0	a	The most important thing to note about this skirt is that it is a true blue color- not black! it's also perfect for spring , summer and early fall. super comfy, casual yet elegant. size runs a tiny bit small as the waist is not elasticized. a staple of a cozy chic wardrobe.
2566	0	a	I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist), so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear, but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o
2567	1	a	I love denim and this tunic/dress/shirt is soft and fits really well except its almost too long to be a tunic/shirt but too short to be a dress - at least for me but i have a long torso - still not sure if i should keep it.
2568	0	a	"These are amazing! wide slits on out seam show off your cute shoes! runs large! i'm 5'7"", 140, size 6, hourglass. small was quite loose at waist. xs fits my actual waist and makes length right for flatter shoe <3"" heel. or small petite sits on my hips and makes length right for flatter shoe. both fit. there is ease through entire pant leg. beyond comfortable! doesn't wrinkle. looks great with the roll-neck sweater in ivory and a silver wedge shoe!"
2569	1	a	I received this dress today for a june wedding. i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it. it runs very big. i normally like to wear items a bit bigger/baggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides. bummer :(
2570	5	a	"I wanted to love this jumpsuit. it looks adorable in the product photo. i am 5'5"" about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me. i tried everything--- pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line, wearing a variety of heel heights----i couldn't seem to make it work. there was just so much fabric on me! it felt like i was wearing pajamas (and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out' way). i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut. on me, this jumpsuit was just"
2571	1	a	"I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4"" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest, but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this, but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though."
2572	1	a	I bought this dress for a cruise i'm going on in january. it's so light and comfortable. i'm 5'10 and the length is perfect. it will look really cute with a jean jacket and some booties. great price for this dress! you can't pass this up!!
2573	3	a	I had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo, i even waited for it to come back in stock. the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy. for reference i ordered xs, and i am usually a 0/2 on top (small chested). it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me. so disappointing.
2574	2	a	I got the floral suit and honestly, it's the most beautiful bathing suit i have ever owned. i have yet to wear it to the pool or beach so i don't know how it holds up when getting wet. i can see where other reviewers have said there is no support in the chest. it is padded which is nice, but no underwire or anything to hold the girls up. if you are big chested this could be an issue - not so much for me. :) looking forward to wearing this suit when the weather gets warmer!
2575	4	a	This is a great shirt for fall. very comfortable and flowy, without making you look dumpy. tried it on in the store, ended up waiting to buy online at the sale price.
2576	2	a	I bought a suit similar to this last year, and loved it! this year i bought the pineapple print, and it is beautiful (size 2). it is classy/sexy. i have a long torso, so i like that it covers me better than most one piece swim suits i try on. i highly recommend this product!
2577	0	a	These are such a great fall staple. the silver color is the perfect grey-olive, and the texture is perfect. doesn't feel like there is extra material like most cords, and they hold their shape throughout the day. the fit is just perfect, i can finally order pants online that i know will fit just perfectly.
2578	4	a	"I like what they were going for here, and the fabric. but it falls short in that i can't wear it to work---the back ""keyhole"" is massive so i can't wear my normal bras, and the very wide neck also shows bra straps, so unless i want to go with a strapless bra, it's not useful for me. i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that. i'd go without, but that is a no-no where i work. i may try getting a size smaller. i wear a med. and i got a small and mayb"
2579	0	a	Bought these in store and bought another on line. super comfortable and great for a casual look. great length as well! love the pilcro line.
2580	0	a	I love the beautiful flowy material and design. definitely runs a bit large. i ordered an xs and it needs to be taken in as well as taken up. i would have ordered the petite if it wasn't out of stock, so the length is probably fine for most. shimmery detail is beautiful.
2581	4	a	"Love this top. bought it in both color ways. just adorable and washes well. great option for larger ladies.  retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores. i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me, and there is nothing for us. it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you, but you don't want it."
2582	4	a	The uniqueness of this top caught my eye online. i normally wld not want a long sleeve top in the summer. a bit warm to wear outside now but i like the casual but unique style of it. it's a top i can wear now but only indoors with a/c. the regular small fits fine. a little oversized & sleeves a little long - as in the pic. the color/style/detaling is exactly as in the pic - no surprises. soft & comfy. a little opaque but a nude bra will work fine. i don't see the need for a tank/cami under it. i
2583	1	a	This dress is very versatile and flattering on-- i've already worn it out to casual cocktails with friends twice since i've gotten it. i'm 5'3 and 125 lbs and the 4 petite worked perfectly on me.
2584	1	a	"I ordered this dress, along with several others, for an upcoming wedding. this was my favorite of all of them as far as style; unfortunately it just didn't fit. i'm 5'2"" 116lbs and my regular size 2 was slightly too long, the waist a bit too low, the shoulders a tad too wide. as a result it hung on me like on a hanger. i guess i would need a petite but alas does not appear to come petite..."
2585	0	a	I love everything about these pants- the color, the fit, the detail. oh, and these have a button fly. i didn't realize that when i ordered them, but i love it. i haven't had a pair of button fly pants in so long. these have a nice stretch to them as well. hei hei knows what they're doing. and i got them on sale. thank you retailer!!
2586	4	a	I can't get enough off-the-shoulder tops. so even though this is out of season, i went for it...in both colors! my only con is the fabric has a slight sheen which cheapens the look a tad. like i'd read in other reviews, it does run a bit small for this cut top - i just wanted a bit more volume in the neck hole and in the waist since i won't be tucking in. if you want it more fitted and ruched around the waist, go for your normal size. i'll be ordering a small in both colors because i know i won'
2587	4	a	"I am 5'9"" 155#. i bought the charcoal gray in a large and i love it. fabric is super soft. hangs beautifully. no weird spreading across the chest like the previous reviewer. i have long arms and the sleeves are long and hit me mid palm just like the model in the photo. i have worn the sleeves rolled up and down and it works. recommend this for a casual comfy top with interesting design."
2588	1	a	On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.
2589	1	a	This dress fitted me like a glove. i ordered the size 4, at 5ft7 and 130lbs, it was perfect though i could not weigh two pounds more. i cannot wait to wear it, it has that wow thing going for it, very good quality too.
2590	3	a	"-like others, i agree that this is a staple that will pair with many, many outfits. it is really well-constructed, classic, comfortable, and a wonderful length for us taller gals. as you can see from my stats, i'm rather tall at 5'9"", so it's hard to find"
2591	4	a	Love the fit, i purchased a medium,and like the room it gives, not snug against my body. the waistline cut is my favorite. purchased three colors, black, white and mustard. all are very flattering for my age (60) and i wear with my skinny jeans!
2592	0	a	I love the look of this garment. from the color to the detailed design, it is just awesome looking. i tried this in 3 sizes: 2regular, 2petite, and 0 regular. i often order petite pants and they work, but for this item the crotch was too high for me to wear a petite size, and the legs were short enough to look awkward. i returned it for the 0 regular which fit me best - i'm 5'5, 110 lbs. i haven't worn it out yet, but am excited to wear it to a couple weddings this season. one fallback is that i
2593	4	a	"I am 5'3"" and the arms of this sweater run at least 2 inches past my finger tips. if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall, it just doesn't work. also, i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online. sigh."
2594	4	a	Love the weight. something i can wear winter and spring.
2595	1	a	"I tried on this dress in the portland, me, store today. so much good to say about it: the wine color is deep and rich, the fabric hand is similar to a heavy weight silk, the cut of the dress so flattering. but, i didn't get it. i am 5'2"" and weigh 135 lbs. i can sometimes wear a medium, but my upper arms and hips can require a large, usually petite for proper length. the store didn't have a large (i didn't even realize the dress also came in petite), so i tried on a medium. nice fit through the"
2596	3	a	Don't try this on, if you don't plan to buy it. it feels amazing!!! i bought the black and it is a lovely charcoal color and matches so much.
2597	4	a	So soft!! such beautiful fabric!! it flows so gracefully and looks lovely with black leggings as pictured. one of my favorite retailer purchases to date...
2598	4	a	Wow im really glad i didn't listen to the negative reviews! in ordered this top in the black and red and i have to say this is one of my favorite tops! the neck line i agree does need to be secured. i wish they would have added a snap. it's fine though as i don't mind sewing it closed. this top is worth it! i'm 5'2 108 lbs and small chested. so for slim girls i think this is perfect!
2599	4	a	Not sure where to start with this top...it's that good! i am usually a large in most maeve tops and that's sizing up for extra flow. i ended up grabbing this piece of perfection in an xl only because it ran a little shorter than i anticipated and was kind of tight through my shoulders. i wanted more flow (as always) so i went up in size. for that reason i feel it runs pretty true to size. this is the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and is definitely a must have! it has sold out with
2600	0	a	These shorts are super soft and comfortable. i am normally a size 27 or a 2 in shorts. i got a size 26 in these shorts and they are still large. i exchanged them for a 25 and they fit perfectly. so these run 1-2 sizes large. other than sizing, these shorts are perfectly comfortable and functional.
2601	0	a	Love these pants. the perfect cuffed crop pant for the summer. lightweight, cool, and comfortable. fun pocket details. i typically wear a 26 and bought a 2 in these. within a short time, they were slipping a bit low on the waist. that's my only frustration. they are a loose fitting pant but they shouldn't slip off the waist. perhaps a 0 would fit better. these weren't in my local store (an hour away), so i ordered online. perhaps i'll try ordering another color in both the 0 and 2. i would sugge
2602	4	a	"Cute tee shirt but it runs very large.i ordered a small and probably an xxs would have fit.unfortunately i have to return it.for reference i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs."
2603	1	a	"In both senses, it is pretty and big and pretty big. i ordered the xs as the xxs and xs petite were both out, and it is to big on me. i am usually xs petite or xs, if shorter. i definitely need xxs (petite or not). (115 lbs, 30 dd, 26-27 inch waist)  that being said, it is really cute and fun and flirt, but not romantic flirty, just girl next door flirty. the navy and white stripes are classic, so will last over the seasons. the cut is flattering, i really love it, just not on me being that"
2604	5	a	"I recommend this topper but with reservations. it is beautiful looking, especially the lace portion.  it is also very wide. the gathered portion is a complete design fail, it balloons up right below the bust, making one look wide and pretty ridiculous. it's obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body. but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise.  i ordered size s, the smallest available, and it fit very wide more like a"
2605	0	a	Purchased these in the blue motif. love the hei hei brand. . they run true to size. they are very comfortable and wear well. you can wear them to the office,dress them up or go casual with a tee. versatility and comfort, what more could you ask for.
2606	1	a	This dress ran small in the arms for me. when i returned it for a bigger size, the dress i got had a huge rip in the decorative threading on the back. i can't believe the product wasn't checked for flaws this huge before shipping. i asked for another one in the same size. we'll see if it, too, is defective
2607	1	a	The details on this dress are lovely. the embroidery is wonderful. but the fit on this dress is just not for me. it is very baggy and shapeless. it doesn't have any curves at all so it just drapes down me and looks formless. really unflattering. sad but it's going back.
2608	0	a	"Oh this skirt is gorgeous but i feel it runs small in the waist!! i'm sending it back and ordered up- i'm happy i did as today it's sold out. beautiful and vibrant colors, very well made- just wish some of the retailer sizes wouldn't run on the smaller side!!!"
2609	2	a	I just bought the grey, and now i'm coming back for the black and cream i lovethis staple item!! so soft fits great!
2610	1	a	As other reviewers have said, this is the perfect summer maxi dress! i'm tall, just under 6 feet, and while the dress could be just a bit longer it still works for my height. i do wish the skirt was lined, but other than that the dress is excellent. worth buying at full price if you're worried about it selling out!
2611	1	a	Love the fit and style of this maxi. have gotten many compliments! however, my toddler grabbed the dress when she was falling over and it pulled a bunch of threads out and made the fabric look puckered and worn in that spot!!! for a toddler to do that makes me feel like the quality isn't amazing. also, the waist part itches me.
2612	1	a	"Tried this on in the store in a small (i'm a size 6 in most retailer dresses) and it was enormous. i'm short (5'2"") so i knew i'd need a petite size. ordered a petite small and the length is better - still a lot of fabric, but i think a petite xs would be too small if you are curvier up top (i'm a full 34d and the petite small is just slightly tight in the bust). definitely size down in this or you'll be swimming in it!"
2613	4	a	I had been eyeing this top for a while so i was so happy to see it go on sale! i was so excited that i went to my local retailer to try to purchase it right away. unfortunately this top did not fit me right. on the model it looks adorable, on me it was frumpy & ugly. the petite is sold out so i tried a regular medium (i'm usually in-between a medium & a large) & it fit me big & just didn't do anything to my figure. i agree with the other reviewers that the bow was too thin & flimsy & needed to be
2614	0	a	"I bought these in the olive green, in the store and will be ordering the gray pair online. i am 5' 9"" and 145 lbs, long legs and these are beyond adorable. some people mentioned that they stretched out? i did not find this to be true. what i do know is they can be dressed up or dressed down. they are flattering and perfect for the spring/summer. i would highly recommend and would/will purchase in every color. well done retailer!! one of my most favorite purchases so far this spring."
2615	4	a	I agree a few others, it may be a little bit boxy but i don't even care because it's so beautiful! definitely a top i'm going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade.
2616	1	a	It is a little pricey for what it is, but i love it so much that i am keeping it. i am normally size 4-6 and the s fits great. the rope straps are just adorable!
2617	2	a	This sweater is far more slouchy and relaxed in fit than in it seems in the photograph. definitely size down. honestly, i kinda love it anyways! the inside is so very soft, and it's perfect for a sleek errand-running or hiking kind of day!
2618	1	a	"I see me wearing this dress with more of an edgey look - not going for romantic. smoky eye, skinny dark jeans under it and pumps. swings further from body than i thought.  i'm 5'7"", wear a 34b and am typically a size 2. that's the size i bought. fits well and while pretty, it's made with heft ... not overly delicate - can't see this snagging. it's more of a cotton lace which is why it looks cool with skinny jeans. detail at the neck gives it more interest."
2619	1	a	I got this because it was on sale and it looked like a fun design.  i like it so much more than i expected to!  the material drapes beautifully so the lower parts skims my body while the upper part moves nicely but doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;t stick out too much.  i love the green color too!  i tie the ties on the back of the dress--at the level of my shoulder blades--rather than on top as in the photo.  i think it looks cuter that way.  so glad i took a chance on it!
2620	1	a	Love this dress and the color
2621	5	a	Besides being my favorite color to wear, this dress oozes vintage glamour while not looking like a costume. the fabric is super silky and will need a professional steaming to get out any wrinkles. the fit is not what i'm used to, because it fits in a 1940s type of way, and when i took it to my tailor, she ensured me that it is the perfect fit. the bodice is a bit looser than contemporary pieces, but is perfect for a night out.
2622	1	a	One word: obsessed. feel like a carrie bradshaw bohemian queen. sturdy and luxurious, pretty fancy, definitely queen-worthy. i&amp;amp;#39;m walzing around my house in this dress listening to john mayer and feeling fab
2623	5	a	This dress is very pretty and would be nice for a summer wedding. you will need to go braless or wear a strapless bra. i am sending it back because as it runs very small. i am a 34a and the size 2 was too snug across the top.
2624	4	a	Pic doesn't do it justice, very flattering. i got it in navy. definitely worth the sale price!
2625	4	a	Very flattering and love style, print and color. i sized up one size and perfect fit. great with page grey wash skinny mid rise jeans.
2626	1	a	This is a beautiful dress! the photos do not do it justice - the pink is gorgeous! it's also very comfortable but runs large. i'm usually a 6 or an 8 but purchased a 4.
2627	2	a	This dress is very soft and comfy but transparency is an issue. having said that, i think as long as you wear flesh-colored undergarments you'd be fine in a casual situation. the natural fiber is especially comfortable and the detailed stitching around the neck and chest area is pretty. my store didn't have petite sizes and the regular length was too long for me so i passed on it.
2628	0	a	These jeans are great. the rise is perfect.
2629	4	a	What a wonderful find! yes, it runs big. .. and beautiful! love the quality, and design. very light and airy. this is great for me because i'm not short & i am busty & i love tunics. this item can be dressed up or played down with class. the lining is a perfect complement to the tunic as well and fits nice with the garment. i am usually to busy to write a review, but i felt obligated on this item. five stars!
2630	1	a	"This dress is gorgeous in person. it is so much softer than it appears the photo and the fabric moves well. what you can't see from the picture is that the bodice sort of overhangs the skirt by an inch or so which is really nice for accentuating a small waist and separates the top from the bottom in a cool way.   i am 5'6"" 135 lbs and curvy. 36-26-39 for reference. i ordered the 4 and it is loose although still flattering thanks to the forgiving cut. wish i had gotten a 2 but now they are sold"
2631	3	a	I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p, as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015, and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p, it was much too
2632	4	a	It's a cozy sweater that doesn't make me feel frumpy, still stylish and it's not too heavy but still warm enough. it's like wearing a blanket sort of. definitely sheer with the big loom, wear a camisole under it. i got compliments the first day i wore it!
2633	1	a	I love this dress! it is amazingly comfortable and flattering (i would think to many body types). i have a more athletic, petite body build and this dress gives me great curves. i have already received so many compliments while wearing it out! the best part is, i can wear it to work (i'm a teacher), and then wear it out by easily dressing it up.
2634	0	a	This jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer! unique and absolutely beautiful. i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller. hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece. i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket.
2635	1	a	This is a cute dress, but it runs very large through. if i had decided to keep it, i would have taken it to my seamstress to remove some of the volume. when i ordered, i assumed it was red and black checked, but it is navy. my black cropped leather jacket and boots won't work with those colors, so it is going back.
2636	0	a	I love love love these pants!!! they actually fit me and look great!!!! buyer beware that the dye used is very delicate. i had a very slight stain on them that most likely only i noticed, but i decided to use a spray and wash stain remover. the resulting removal of the stain came with a very large loss of color anywhere the stain remover touched. unfortunately this has made these pants unwearable. buy, wear and wash these with care!!!
2637	4	a	I love this top! i have all 4 colors in size large. i'm 5'9 170 lbs with a large bust. it's a loose fit that is very flattering. do not dry i wash in cold water and hang dry. first one i bought i dried and it shrunk quick a bit. if you are tall, size up.
2638	0	a	Love the fit and comfort of these jeans!!! better than my 7's and citizens. the distressing is perfect, i don't have to worry about enlarging a knee hole. like another reviewer noted the color is lighter in person. they fit true to size for me and kept their shape a 3 wears. wish a knew about these before!!
2639	4	a	"When i saw this sweater, it made me think of the 70's chic trend thats very now but due to the colors (my favorite tones) it would be something i would be reaching for for years to come. i love it combined with jeans but i also worse it over a dress (see photo) - i am wearing it over corey lynn calter floral dress ""paeonia dress"", and i paired it with the ""rosebud layered necklace"". i got two of this sweater as i want to have one for when i wear the first one out :) i am 5'6"", 127 and even thoug"
2640	4	a	I bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip - and i think it'll do just fine! it's a wonderful open-gauge knit - delicate and light, but substantial enough that i don't fear snagging it constantly. the cloth has a nice weight and drape, and while the fit is on the loose side, it does look intentional. wonderful as a pullover or by itself. i have the minty blue-green color, and it's divine. definitely worth the price.
2641	0	a	Adorable skirt. thought the a-line and length were great. 5'4 and 135lbs. went up a size and it fit perfect. can dress it up or down. really happy with this wardrobe staple.  not too stiff denim of so moves well and feels comfortable.
2642	1	a	"Like other reviewers have stated, this dress does run small on the chest. i'm 5.3"", 32c, 120lbs and size 2 fits me great. however, if my chest size had been, like 34d and up, size 2 will not fit me although i'm petite frame. so, if you have a large chest, i would recommend going 1 or 2 sizes up. if you are like myself, small bust person, then you should try your regular size and one size down to see which one fits you better. i was going to try size zero, however as soon as i tried size 2, i rea"
2643	1	a	Maeve really keeps me guessing on sizing...usually too big, but this one is too small in my normal 4, so i went with the 6 for comfortable movement while still maintaining the intentional fitted look. fabric is of beautiful quality, colors are true to the picture - just a gorgeous timeless dress that i imagine wearing to many special events, or with a denim jacket over it for work :)
2644	4	a	I love this jacket and always get compliments when i wear it. i have the green version, and the color is lovely. the sleeves are the perfect length ( i got a petite size) and it is very flattering. the jacket is not warm enough for a really windy, snowy day, but is perfect for cool fall days.
2645	4	a	I am a 34dd so i purchased the small in green, hoping for a more fitted silhouette. i got what i wanted and it looked great overall. except for the chest. it just sort of mashed my chest down in a very unflattering way. but despite all that i almost kept the coat because it was so soft and warm and beautiful. and sturdy! i could have sized up for a better fit in the chest but then it would have been boxy and we hourglass shaped ladies know how poorly that works out. wish this would have worked b
2646	5	a	"This gorgeous dress is what retailer is all about. natural fibers like silk and rayon and cotton, unusual beautiful prints and colors, not your average day to day find. i bought this in my usual size l, and while i could use a bit more room in the top, it works either unbuttoned one button, which shows the beautiful turquoise slip that comes with it, or, i am going to stitch it down the front so the buttons won't open and the top won't gap at the bust. i am 5'5"" and the dress is a perfect l"
2647	4	a	I'm 5-months pregnant and wanted some beautiful tunics to mix it up between the usual maternity wear. this top is lovely! i love the cut, length and embroidered details however i am not a fan of the side slits. this will work much better post partum so i plan to keep it but my belly currently pulls the slits a bit awkward.
2648	4	a	This is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big.
2649	4	a	Also, does run big, though i felt te xs seemed fine (usual size is xs). passed as there were better options, runs big,but mostly, it was scratchy. beautiful color and design, however.
2650	1	a	This dress is beautiful. swingy and fun, and the floral pattern is just stunning for fall and winter. i am planning on wearing it with black tights and ankle booties. could be dressed up or down- very versitle. fits my tall curvy frame perfectly. love.
2651	1	a	"I am 5'4"", 145 pounds, 34dd and ended up with the size small for reference. it fit well but definitely roomy - in case you're not into that style. never tried the extra small, but i would prefer this dress not to hug onto me so i stayed with the small.   this dress was really nice and comfy, soft material. the pockets are low and my phone stayed in while i walked but i wouldn't recommend anything heavier than a phone to go in the pockets.   i wore this to a family and friends function and re"
2652	0	a	"Love the pattern play on this skirt! i had to size up to a 6 (i usually take a 2 or 4 in skirts) as it was too snug in the hips/waist. going up a size worked well and the hem hit me at the knee (i'm 5' 6""). thought it looked cute with the cloth & stone chambray tank :)"
2653	4	a	I have two of these tops. the maroon and tan and white stripe. the material is great and the neckline lays great. it isn't too thick so i can wear it on cooler florida days. you can dress it up under a jacket or dress down with some jeans.
2654	4	a	Have had a hard time finding comfy dresses appropriate but not too long for my 15 year old daughter. purchased this tunic in a regular xs and she loves it! she wore today with suede booties-very soft, cute and longer than many dresses sold for teens. she initially thought it was a winter sweater dress but i explained it is mostly cotton and would be a great transitional piece for spring and fall.
2655	5	a	I am waist-challenged. i like a narrowly cut structured sheath dress, sort of like the 60s styles. this is a great dress either belted or loose with great accessories and lovely shoes. it has so many colors in the pattern, you can wear this with anything, and the fabric is so high-end and quality that you can definitely wear this to work with a jacket and then change into a denim or leather jacket and tough high boots and go out for the evening in the fall-winter. it arrived in the mail and righ
2656	4	a	The only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big. i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for. i wouldn't say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect. still love it!
2657	4	a	This blouse runs large, billows out slightly, and hangs in a boxy straight way. i'm normally a medium but can probably wear a small in this blouse. the blouse is lined with a light-weight material but i can still see through it just a little bit. although very pretty, the blouse can snag easily so be careful when wearing. regardless, i plan to return for a small because this blouse is beautiful and unique. perfect for fall with its warm colors or summer because it's light weight.
2658	5	a	This dress attracted my attention with its victorian inspired print. the details are to die for. the blue is not the same as the picture. slightly darker and more muted.
2659	4	a	Not just another striped tee. perfect drape & lightly fitted at the bottom sides so it skims the body & is super flattering. the subtle shimmer is just right. love the gray! very versatile & irresistible. i'm a size 4/small & this is tts.
2660	5	a	I wanted to love this dress. the wool is lightweight yet warm and drapes beautifully. the plaid print is rich, however it is much darker in color than shown in the photos. the dress runs very large. i ordered it in my typical size and it was too big. dolman sleeve dresses usually look great on me, but the cut of this dress, while beautiful, was nothing remarkable. for as expensive as it is it would have had to be an amazing dress for me to keep it. sadly it didn't quite make the cut. it's a sham
2661	1	a	"I really love this dress. it's very flattering for all body types - i'm 5'4"", 120 and i purchased a small. it also looks really cute with a stretchy belt. in the picture - it doesn't show this, but it has these cute snap sleeves that adds some great detail. it's also very comfortable. it is a thin material, so for those looking for a thicker fabric - this may not be the right dress. loved it!"
2662	4	a	In love with this. as soon as i received it in the mail i ordered another color. super soft and easy to wear. i imagine i will live in this top the rest of the summer. felt pricey, but worth it for as much wear as i will get out of it. i am 5'10, 160 and the large is a great fit. perfect fit on the shoulders and just a hair loose throughout the rest of the tank, which is what i wanted.
2663	4	a	I purchased the navy breton stripe version of this shirt. it's chic, versatile, and soft, a great rendition of a wardrobe classic.
2664	1	a	"The dress has a partially sewn-in slip, which really didn't work for me. no matter how much adjusting i did i couldn't get the slip and dress to sit properly.  i ordered a medium, and if it hadn't been for the slip, the fit would have been good. the length was as pictured. for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40, 34ddd."
2665	0	a	So comfortable-so versatile-so perfect
2666	0	a	"These pants fit me perfectly..i am 5'7"" and 134 (most days).. and wore a 4..they are so comfortable, i could sleep in them. they do stretch a little after wearing (linen), which can be a good thing to some...they are a heavier linen so good for mild winters..almost look denim..if they came in more colors i would get more!they also remind me of my old hippie days, which was fun"
2667	1	a	"I saw this dress online first and suspected i would like it, but the price scared me away. then, while visiting in portland, i saw it on sale at an retailer store. when i came out of the dressing room to look in a bigger mirror the store clerk said, ""well that's a no-brainer!"" i thought the same thing. i love this dress so much i actually would have paid full price for it. it's super fun and easy to wear; i paired it with navy blute tights and suede ankle booties. i'm 5'6, 138 lbs and the m"
2668	4	a	Love the color, but the fit is just odd and frumpy. the sleeves are shorter than the should be. when i lift my arms, the entire sweater gets lifted. going back.
2669	1	a	I love dolan dresses! the fabrics are always beautiful, and the colors are always unique. i usually wear an xs petite in dolan, but i ordered both the xs and the xs petite, and i think i'm going to keep the xs. i had a hard time deciding which to keep, but the xs petite was just a hair too short. i think this is a versatile dress for all seasons. you could pair it with tights in fall/winter, but it is great for spring/summer, too...
2670	1	a	I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant, but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d
2671	0	a	Beautiful fit and true to size. highly recommend. they are long and you will need to have them hemmed but they are soft and feel amazing on.
2672	4	a	So simple to throw on with jeans, or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft, really comfy. i haven't decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great, and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color, like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade.
2673	4	a	I so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good. i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful color....but......the fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips. first the fit, the arm pits are low and don't actually tuck into where your armpits are, so you have this weird restriction in arm movement. then the design is not great either (and others mentioned this), the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi
2674	4	a	I really loved how this top looked and was really excited it to get it on sale. i was worried that it might be too small/tight (i ordered a m and would consider myself a m) but was relieved to find it fit just fine. i was extremely disappointed to find that it was too sheer to wear by itself and still showed my bra with a layering tank on underneath. it was also more like a crop top for length, which does not work with my mama belly.
2675	2	a	The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse, the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).
2676	4	a	"This sweater is exactly what you think it is.   comfy!   it doesn't have much shape (it's pretty boxy), but that's the point. it's not one of those figure flattering kind, but it's also not shabby looking.   it's so darn comfortable and soft and the colors are so upbeat and beautiful.   since it's a fuzzy yarn type of fabric, i think the fuzz might start to fall out eventually and i have to be careful not to snag anything on it because i don't want to pull the knitting loose.   other t"
2677	2	a	I got the burgundy color and i do have to say that the color looks a little better online than it does in person, but it's not too much of a difference. this is a really cute thong, and if you're just trying to be sexy/romantic, then i think it would be fine and there's nothing at all wrong with it. however, i like to wear thongs just in general because i think they're comfortable and i like not having to worry about panty lines, and this is definitely not the most comfortable. the front pattern
2678	2	a	These are truly slouchy leggings. i am short (5'3) so they do bunch quite a bit for me but when paired with a long chunky sweater they are perfect! unlike the other review, i felt that they ran a little on the larger side. i am typically an 8/10 and ordered the m/l. they sit nicely on my lower waist and do not sag but the length is long long long. i recommend these for wearing out or around the house.
2679	4	a	I was expecting this to be longer. nothing wrong with it, i will be returning it because it was a little short.
2680	5	a	This jacket is a real treasure and i could never have seen how substantial the embroidery is from the photo. also from the pic the jacket looks like a thin cotton, but on the contrary it is a wonderful weight with a feel like denim. the embroidery is a wonderful texture like heavy string or thin rope so it really has dimension... . i loved it so much i got the sweatshirt also by the same designer. can't wait until cooler weather so i may live in it! also when you have it on for a bit it seems to
2681	0	a	This will be my third pair of hei hei shorts.  i was very pleased with the previous two shorts, sand city short and dobby beach comber.  all shorts have nice materials and not too tight, perfect for the summer.  i typically wear s or m depending with the material and design.  i bought size s and it fits nicely.
2682	1	a	Oh my goodness, i paid full price for this dress because i loved it so much. i styled it with a cream lace poncho , also from retailer, and it is gorgeous. at the sale price, you can't lose.
2683	4	a	"I bought one of each color. love them all! they fit well and are very soft. washing and drying them are not a big issue either. i didn't notice any shrinking. i wear xs and s depending on the fabric and cut. for this, i bought a small. (i'm 34a, ~125 lbs, 5'8"".) it's loose and flowy without being overly baggy. the tail of the shirt reaches just below my butt. if you're going to wear this with a pencil skirt or low rise jeans, the buttons on the side might get in the way a little. but that doesn'"
2684	1	a	I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i love the colors and pattern. i've just been on the fence whether it complements my hippy frame. i'm a size 8/10 right now. i do like it with or without the tie for different effects. one concern is that the website says hand wash and the tag on the seam says dry clean only. i usually don't buy dry clean clothes, but might make an exception for this one.
2685	1	a	I really love how comfortable and versatile this dress is. the midi length is perfect for booties or flats, and the cowl neck is loose and fluid, so it lays well. the only complaint i had, and it's minor, is the tulip skirt doesn't stay closed well when i walk or sit, which reveals more inner thigh than i am comfortable showing. i have to be very mindful of the skirt all day (i teach high school).
2686	4	a	This is a gorgeous sweater with a great proportion in terms of length and fit. i am petite, so i worried that such a long sweater might look weird on me, but it actually makes me look slim and taller. i get so many compliments when i wear it. i ordered the xxs petite.
2687	1	a	I couldn't get this to work for me. tried a variety of sizes and just couldn't get it to flow right. didn't purchase.
2688	4	a	"I waited so long before trying this on because i have a bad addiction to white/cream tops that i'm trying to get over and branch out, but after seeing someone else wearing it i decided to give it a whirl. i was also trying on the black and white charlie's with the leaf print at the time and fell in love. it hits me a lot longer than the modeled photo (i'm about 5'7"" for reference) and the shoulders were a little tight for me in my usual small, so i got a medium. the sleeve length is perfection,"
2689	0	a	"This skirt is a really beautiful print and made of a lovely silky fabric. i didn't have the ""see-through"" issue that the other reviewer mentioned, my main concerns were the length (i'm 5'1 and it almost goes to my ankles) and that it poofs out a little right below the waist band. i'm between a small and a medium and went with the small. it fits but i wonder if it would lie flatter and be more flattering if i had gone with a medium instead."
2690	4	a	This top is exactly what i was expecting. super comfortable while still looking stylish. just covers your bum so you can wear it with leggings or jeans!
2691	1	a	I bought this today in navy and loved it the second i put it on. it feels great on, is well made and flattering! you can wear it anywhere and look pulled together. much cuter in real life too. it does run a little small. id go up a size if you're getting the white so it won't cling too much.
2692	4	a	"Top was featured in an email ad. i love the colors in both tops and bought both plaids. i'm 5'4"", about 130 lbs, and the medium fits well. it is long in the back, but i like that. if the front were a little longer, i'd prefer that, but the length is ok. the colors are definitely cheery and mood-enhancing, very appropriate for this holiday season."
2693	0	a	I've been looking for a versatile maxi skirt all season. the pleats and layered look were a great effect to a really basic navy maxi skirt. the waist is elastic (great for after baby) and will look good with a shirt tucked in and belt. the only drawback is that it's a little too long and will drag on the ground if i wear flats (i'm 5'7''). soft material with some flowy movement when you walk.
2694	0	a	I'm always scared of rompers because of my height and long legs. but this one was perfect. it didn't ride up or hit in a weird spot on the hips. it's very flattering.
2695	1	a	This is a classic! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style!!! love it!
2696	1	a	"I decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet. i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured, only about 3 inches shorter. i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late, everything i seem to order is huge. this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured, a nice green. fabric was a gauzy cotton. the dress was just ""alright"". nothing special to warrant the price tag. it felt like a little girl's dress on me"
2697	2	a	This bra is so soft and comfortable i feel like i'm not wearing a bra at all, except i have the gentle support i need. the material is very thin and the pink color is see through, so not recommended under a white or see through shirt. perfect for sleeping or lounging in!
2698	0	a	"This skirt fits great. the thick material helps it lay nicely and smooth the curves. i'm 5-4"" about 130lbs, athletic build with a bottom and the med fit well."
2699	4	a	"This top had potential, but the cut is very boxy and not fitted at all like the front picture shows. the picture from the back is much more representative of what it looks like. i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s and the xs in this was still huge and boxy, but very short with tight sleeves (i have small arms so hardly ever have an issue with tight sleeves). the small fit better as far as length and and sleeves, but still very boxy. the pattern and cutouts are very cute, but thi"
2700	4	a	It is very comfortable and the fabric is amazing. it runs a little short on me because i have a long torso, but it works great with a tank underneath. love it!
2701	4	a	"I purchased this shell in black. the embellishments and construction of the top are of a good quality, like as shown. i am 5'4"", 120# and typically purchase an xs. this ran a bit bigger than i was expecting from the reviews, but i am overall happy with the top. the center slit may be too revealing for those with a smaller bust."
2702	4	a	This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy, loose-fitting tops, but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.
2703	1	a	This dress is beautiful, it just swallowed my small frame whole! the colors and design are gorgeous, just not a good fit for me, even at a 0p.
2704	1	a	"I really wanted to love this dress, but it was so short! i'm only 5'6"" so i don't consider myself really tall, but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt! way too short for me. my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha. but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter. or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt :)"
2705	2	a	I was really excited that they decided to make these. i am a big fan of the tanks and wanted a long sleeve (or even short sleeve - hint!) version of them to wear under suits to work in the winter etc. these do the job nicely - bought ivory and black. other reviewer is right however, something strange in the shoulders as they are quite narrow and the fabric tends to bunch a bit and the arm length is a little strange. i am 5'8 and 150 lbs and order a medium in most retailer stuff and i tend to buy a
2706	1	a	I typically wear a 4 in dresses, and sized up to a 6 because of the other reviews. i'm bigger on bottom than on top, and the 6 fit me fine (snug, but fine) on the bottom but the top was a bit big. there was too much material in the arm hole area. it's very pretty and good quality, but not a good fit for pear-shapes.
2707	4	a	This is one of the best things i have ever bought from anrtho. it is very flattering, and i always get compliments when i wear it. must have!
2708	1	a	"This dress is very forgiving on my post baby body. i'm glad i purchased the petite, it hits my ankle perfectly (i'm 5'5""). very versatile, i can see wearing this at work (with a blazer) or on a weekend."
2709	0	a	I just bought these jeans today & they are really cute & comfortable on. i love pilcro jeans as they fit really well, they are made well & they are always on style. i did have to go down a size as well but they fit beautifully! comfy & stylish!
2710	4	a	"This is a beautiful sweater/tunic/dress. i ordered in the mustard color, and wearing it will brighten my day on a dreary winter morning. it is so hard to find winter clothes in bright colors. the sweater is soft and not itchy. it is a bit longer than i expected...maybe 35"" (i am 5'7""), but that is just fine! it can be worn with leggings or tights. dressed up or dressed down. i couldn't be more pleased."
2711	1	a	This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.
2712	4	a	Bought this shirt in the colorful polka dot print and i'm obsessed! like previous reviews mentioned, it runs a little small in the chest. i'm normally a medium but am a 36c so ordered the large and it fits perfect! with the way the buttons are spaced i think all sizes will pull a little no matter what. it's a beautiful shirt and i plan on ordering the blue one as well.
2713	4	a	I love the greenish option, beautiful color. the fabric super soft, and like the peek thru openings on the arms - they call it lace, but it's not really. i'm 5'9 and 140 lbs, medium was good. it is long, but it is what i wanted so works for me.
2714	1	a	I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight, it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said, i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to, where i lo
2715	1	a	I got several compliments when i wore this dress. it's very comfortable and will be great for fall.
2716	4	a	I got so many compliments on this the first day i wore it. i think of this more like a sweater coat than a regular sweater. it is extremely soft and warm, but not bulky at all. it lays really neatly, which is why i think of it more like a coat. this will definitely be a staple moving into the winter and then into spring. keep in mind though that this does not button - they're just for show.
2717	2	a	"Beautiful shorts. make you feel like a million dollars. love love love them!  the robe to match is also adorable."
2718	4	a	Love this top. pretty colors and don't forget to notice the black lace at the bottom. can easily be dressed up or down with jeans or cigarette black pants and heels. everyone looks good with bare shoulders, so this is a definite for my fall / winter season.
2719	4	a	"I had a hard time deciding to order red or turquoise, as both colors are really nice in person. the black, of course, is a classic. another reviewer found the top to be small, but i found it to be a little big on me in my usual size. not too bad, but a little bigger than expected.  teh neck part is effortless as there is stiching to help the colw effect stay in place. the fabric is thin though, so may show things (thinking bra ripples, and perhaps some other ripples in front tummmy). keeping it"
2720	1	a	"For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips) i ordered the small and i was absolutely swimming in it. perhaps the petite would have been better, but there was just too much fabric everywhere. the sleeves were ridiculous on me, and even cinching the waist with a belt just wouldn't have slimmed the silhouette for me. i have muscular shoulders, and 34d chest, so the top fit as it should, just everything became way too much elsewhere. the fabric was soft and sw"
2721	4	a	I saw someone try this on when it was 40% off sale, and should ahve purcahsed it then... ended up going back today for it. it is very soft, adn flattering. also, i purchased the balck, this can go with pretty much anything: jeans, skirts, dresses, you name it - very neutral and flattering fit. nto sure if petite would have worked but too late anyway.
2722	4	a	I really want to love this shirt, but the small is just way too big on me. for reference, i'm a 32d (which is why i didn't want to size down much more than a small), 5'6' and 125 and i'm drowning in this. i'm going to try it with different bottoms and ultimately will keep it because i do love the quality. just size down a couple of sizes!!
2723	2	a	This hoodie is really cute-i got the polka dot color and it is very soft and roomy. i am normally a small but got the medium and it fits exactly how i wanted. however-it is not a pullover and instead zips up. so odd that the pic of the hoodie is a pullover. debated returning because i wanted a pullover, but have decided to keep it because of how soft it is.
2724	0	a	I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.
2725	1	a	Very pretty. runs true to size. waist is higher than in the photo, as other reviewers have stated. correct fit is important because the arm openings are a little big, i thought, and when i sized up to try to get the waist a little lower, the arms were too large.
2726	3	a	"This blazer is beautiful. it runs tts. it is lightly lined with an off-white poplin. in the body of the jacket, the off-white lining is an adorable swiss dot. though the lining makes the lace portions of the jacket not completely see through, a darker shirt would still show through. the detail is amazing - from the adorable buttons to the variations in the fabric texture. i am 5'5"", and the fit (as far as length) is very similar to what is shown on the model. the sleeves are a little on the long"
2727	0	a	I adore these pants! comfortable as jammies and i wear with both sandals and booties. every time i wear them i am complimented on them!
2728	0	a	I love these jeans. the fit is much better than the white pilcro hyphen slit jean which is cuts lower. nice weight. not to heavy and not too light in weight. these look terrific with the vanja peasant top in the yellow print. a darling outfit. the lace give them flair and dress them up so i can wear them to work. highly recommend!!
2729	1	a	I bought this in the orange color. might not be the color for everyone but with my coloring looked great, very similar to the picture online. fit is perfect, very comfortable. the fabric is night, stretching but flattering. bought this with the 30% off sale, not sure i would have paid full price based on the fabric. but love that i got if for extra off the sale. wish the others were in stock because i would have bought them too.
2730	4	a	Very comfortable, fit over my muscle-y and flabby arms! very pretty.
2731	4	a	I meant to order both red and blue and added to red in my basket by accident, oops, meant to be? the color is very nice, not too bright holiday red, but nice rich red. the cut is very flattering too. i didn't expect to love it as much on. i ordered the xxs p, length was not too high/cropped, perfect. the asymmetrical hem gives some visual interest to the sweater, so does the fun neckline with keyhole on the side... fun take on a sweater... for me, the fabric was comfortable. i am 115 lbs, 30dd,
2732	3	a	I am so glad i had read the other reviews of this jacket which prompted me to order. great fit and cut with a hint of stretch, nice styling details, great vintage color. i wasn't in love with the price but after receiving the jacket i would gladly pay the price again. will definitely be in my wardrobe rotation for years to come!
2733	4	a	"I had my eye on the skier blouse for awhile before i gave in to the purchase. love it for fit and graphics - those happy little skiers! i think many reviewers here don't realize this blouse has the cut of a swing style. it's not meant to be tailored for tucking in. if you want to tuck it you'll be wearing a high-waisted skirt or pant, cute also ;-) rayon fabric is a good choice for the style being heavier than cotton and having a better drape over the chest. the sloping longer hemline toward the"
2734	1	a	This dress was sooo cute online and in the store - i hands down would have bought it but i had an extra few minutes so i decided to try it on- terrible! the dress looked awakward on me- the strings lacing strings had town on a few spots and it just was not flattering for a curvy girl. now i know why there were so many in the store! which is a rarity for my location.
2735	4	a	I got this in the royal blue.it is absolutly beautiful.
2736	2	a	I love seafolly boyleg bathing suits. i find them very flattering and just universally appealing. this one has beautiful summery design as well. i found it to be running slightly smaller than plain colored editions of this suit. i normally wear size 6 (us size) of this suit, but this particular design 6 was too small and had to exchange for 8(us) which fits perfect.
2737	2	a	I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.
2738	4	a	Omg! where have you been all my life? this t-shirt is the best....not see-through, perfect length, perfect v-neck (no cami required), amazing colors, perfect shape, not tight (body skimming), doesn't poof out or look weird on larger busts and goes with everything from jeans to dress pants. i want every color, but for now i ordered the moss and blue which goes perfectly with my fair skin and long silver hair. oh and did i mention the sleeves are perfect to wear with or without a cardigan! no slee
2739	4	a	The blouse is absolutely beautiful. i am 5' and the length is perfect. even though it fit a little snug across the chest, it's a keeper. i'll wear it open on the top with a nice cami underneath.
2740	4	a	Beautiful top but runs a whole size small. gave to my daughter who loved!
2741	2	a	I purchased these on sale. one thing to say, i had to return the first pai r (xs) as there was a missing section of stiching on the sema, creating a whole you can't really fix neatly. so i ordered a new pari. i usually like petite, but regular size was fine, they jsut end up being to the ankle (longer), not bunchy. i also ordered xxs peite to compare, but that was smaller on waist, almost not comfortable), and the laced-up part looked a little weird/overstretched. i have not used htem to work ou
2742	4	a	This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front, and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.
2743	1	a	"I decided to try this dress on based on the other reviewer's positive words, and i wasn't disappointed! it's so cute and stylish. i plan to wear with black boots. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34c, wear a 2 or 4, and i got a 4. one thing - at the waist, the pattern breaks a bit and doesn't match perfectly. i tried on a second dress and liked its pattern more than i did that of the first i tried."
2744	3	a	I love coats and have a collection of unique ones and this one is in my top 3! wow is it a stunner! totally different and very classy. not my every day coat but will be used for dinner outings and special occasions with the right outfit. i did reinforce the buttons since there had been many complaints about that, which is why i only gave it 4 stars for quality. great design on this one retailer!
2745	1	a	Love this dress! perfect length and i love the construction and where the seams hit (not too long, not too short). i got so many compliments with this dress!
2746	0	a	"I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund; the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare. i am 5'6 and wear a size 28. they fit comfortably with great stretch, but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch, you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order.  first they started piling, which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before, and within 2 washes i could actually see through the f"
2747	2	a	"These pants are great. i am 5'6"" and 133lbs. i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms. medium fits well except knee pit area. maybe because they are not very stretching fabric. however, they are still flattering. the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines."
2748	1	a	This is a review of customer service in general,from several issues with online shopping! i don't understand why you ask for my opinion and say it counts when clearly it does not.i have had a lot of issues. receiving parcels from one of your carriers,laser ship and i have reported the issues to them and retailer,but it appears only the good parts are read.this poor service cost me money in postage and lost discounts but again i'm ignored,and i had to order my last returned parcel again pay more fo
2749	1	a	This dress is gorgeous. i took the advice of a previous reviewer and tried one size down, it fit perfectly. i am usually between a 10 or 8 in retailer dresses depending on the cut, the size 8 in this was great. i am near the small chested side a 36b and there was still plenty of room in the top. the swimmers on the dress are embroidered and i didn't really notice until i saw the inside. beautiful detail. the dress is a lightweight cotton and great for warm weather. its even more flattering to be a
2750	2	a	Soft, comfortable, flattering, versatile--what more can you ask for? just wish it came in a long-sleeved version.
2751	2	a	"High quality fabric and lots of bottom/ back coverage. also, it did not cut into my hips (which is fabulous!) ...so, if you're looking for a little more coverage this is your bottom. i found it true to size...i'm 5'8"" and 150 lbs and i got a size 8 :)"
2752	1	a	This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length, color, and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online, so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed, but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice, and the color is lovely.
2753	4	a	I love this top so much that i ordered it in second color. it is shorter but still works with skirts and pants. the material is a fun texture. i didn't have any problems with the arm holes, but this may be due to being less full in the bust area.
2754	4	a	This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this
2755	1	a	"Absolutely gorgeous! words can't describe the beauty of this dress! i hope they will restock it cause i would order size s (didn't know how it runs)."
2756	4	a	I am in love with this top. flannel shirts are a fall staple, but i don't own any. any flannel shirt that i have come across has been a button down, which simply does not work for me, given my chest size. i hate button downs that gap or that i have to leave unbuttoned and wear a tank underneath. it's not flattering. this top is flannel, no buttons, and off the shoulder, which is such a unique and fresh style. the off the shoulder feature stays in place thanks to tiny straps sewn in that you put
2757	1	a	Several reviews have stated this dress is embroidered with a popsicles. it is not embroidered, but an attractive popsicle print. i usually wear a 2p and after reading review ordered an 8p. a bit roomy in waist, but with tie at waist it works. length great, but arm holes large. will have altered as this fit/flare shirtwaist dress is so flattering.
2758	1	a	I ordered this dress in my usual sz 2 it seemed to be tight on the hips , then i tried the next sz 4 and it was tight because ,i realized that the lining was very sticky, and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me, not for curvy on bottom. i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason. i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute, and i really liked the look of the dress, if it goes on sale i may purch
2759	1	a	"I purchased this dress in my regular size xs. i'd come across it several times at my local store but never thought much of it to try it on. . when i saw it was on sale i decided to take a chance. boy was i surprised. the dress is really beautiful.. the hints of gold reflect nicely.. the dress is comfortable and loose yet flattering. i received so many compliments on it. i am 5'1"" and the regular length worked for me."
2760	4	a	Beautiful,delicate and unique cotton blouse that accentuates the waist and falls nicely down the belly. i love the floral print, very appropriate for spring/summer. i agree with the other reviewers who've mentioned that it runs small. i have a bust size of 34 dd and waist size 25 and i had to size up to 12. nevertheless, i am really looking forward to wearing this with a pair of skinny jeans and some nude pumps for a girls night out.
2761	1	a	Bought this dress as good transition piece into our hot fall. don't usually go for the uneven hemline. but got so many compliments, i'm expanding my comfort zone.
2762	2	a	Usually i'd wait for a sale on rayon loungewear but i would have gladly paid more if this was cotton or silk! despite the poor fabric, the design is light and beautiful with a high quality floral print that's distinctive and elegant. i can wear this with a thin strappy slip or a lacy cami bra or with a cardigan, jacket and lacy boy shorts. an retailer employee wore this chemise under a denim shirtdress and belted the whole outfit together--it was perfection. i purchased size m and my figure is 39-
2763	1	a	I splurged on this dress (still a bit pricey, even on sale), but so far it's the best purchase i've made all summer. the terry is a somewhat unusual choice for a dress that otherwise would have been on the fancier side, but it makes it sooooo comfortable--it's even more breathable and lightweight than the super thin cotton sundresses that usually dominate the summer. my only real complaint is that the cut is a bit out of whack. the medium just barely fits my hips, but it's pretty loose on top--y
2764	4	a	"Just bought this at the store. just to be safe, i thought i would try it on before ordering just to confirm the size. that was a good idea. ( i am a 38b, 5'9"", and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts.) the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest. when directly compared to the medium, it seems the major difference is the length-- the large was > 1"" longer than the medium. i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok."
2765	4	a	I love this top! it's perfect for casual outings like a picnic or a movie in summer. it's material is thick enough to feel sturdy but still is very lightweight for summer. it's a little baggy in the front so if that bothers you then i'd size down one size from your normal. i bought my usual size of xs and it seems to fit perfectly. i'm tempted to buy this in more colors.
2766	1	a	"The colors (including the deep blue in the background) are as vibrant and harmonious in person as you would hope, it looks like an oil pastel drawing! the print itself is very well done, i'm so picky about the quality and resolution but even up close every part is beautiful.   the cut is great, it doesn't show too much of the armpit, the straps and sides cover a normal bra, and the neckline just shows the collarbones.  the feel is very light and floaty; some sites mislabel the material but t"
2767	1	a	This is a charming dress, with lots of quality touches, and something which is easy to wear and appropriate for many occasions. however, the dress i received wasn't quite like the dress pictured in the catalog and main website photos. the bottom buttons of the over-dress do not have matching holes, so you can't button it. this makes the v lower, and the bodice looser. it is like the photo with the brunette model on the website, rather than the primary photos with the blonde lady. personally, i w
2768	4	a	"I just received this shirt in the mail, and i'm in love. it isn't your average t-shirt in that it has character and class. i can't wait to wear it! another reviewer was unhappy that the embroidery in blue on the back wasn't as dramatic as the picture; i'm not seeing it. i think the blue stands out very well. i know i should say, ""hurry and get yours before they're gone,"" but in truth, i'd rather be the only one with this beautiful shirt! :)"
2769	3	a	"Just received and sorry to return. i am 5'9"" i wear a size 8 i ordered the m/l . it way really big and to wide"
2770	1	a	"I would describe the color as more blush. the fabric does not have a sheen as in the model picture. the fit is much cuter on than hanging. i'm a 36c and the extra small is just a bit tight in the bust, otherwise i like the fit everywhere else. i'm going to order a small and see how it fits. at 5' 3"" it's also longer on me than on the model but not a deal breaker. looks kind of 1920's vintage on. my fabric is not see through it's more of a twill fabric but not quite as heavy as that."
2771	4	a	Great lightweight summer top that's bra friendly.  i bought the teal color yesterday and wore it today with white skinnies.    i'm sometimes a small and sometimes a medium and was fine with the small on this one
2772	2	a	"I always go w/ black, but deviated this time & so glad i did! quality fabric, not sheer at all. a great layering piece and new staple for the wardrobe. fits tts, sm (i'm 5'2"", 109lbs)"
2773	4	a	"The lace on this top is pretty, and i liked the way it was styled in the product photos, but did nothing for me on. between the loose sleeves and the boxy cut of the front, it just sort of hung shapelessly on me. i also found the back to be much shorter than 30.5""--it came to a few inches below my hips and was not tunic length like i expected. the shoulders fit me well, and because the top was boxy already, i didn't want to size up for length. for reference i tried on xs (i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs)."
2774	0	a	Cute casual drawstring short. runs a little large but nice style for an oversized look. nice length for long legs.
2775	4	a	"This top reminds me of the special tops i got ""once upon a time""...when retailer adopted a more curatorial approach to their store. this is a beautifully-made top...quite dramatic but comfortable. i've received many compliments each time i've worn it. it has wonderful drapery and movement."
2776	4	a	When i saw this shirt it bought back wonderful memories of ice skating on wheatley's pond as a child where i primarily grew up in the northeast. just loved it!! i tried my normal size 4 on but it fell off my shoulders and the cuffs fell mid hand so, i tried the size 2 and it fit perfectly. i see where many say it runs small and for full busted ladies it may but i am only 34b and 116 lbs and the size 2 worked fine. it is slightly blousey in the mid section but not overly so, the fabric and stitch
2777	1	a	I am 5'3' and 120 lbs for reference, and pear shaped and this dress in a 4 petite fit like a glove. granted, not a dress i would want to gain weight in, but fit perfectly. usually i am a 2 in retailer dresses but read other reviews and definitely made the right choice. it hits at a very flattering length even for someone as short as i am.
2778	1	a	Wanted to love this dress. the fabric is very nice, pretty colors, great quality and style. it just didn't work for my body type. it would fit great on someone with narrower shoulders. probably want to size down.
2779	4	a	"I read all reviews and i decided to try as the price was great. first of all i am 5'6"" 145 lbs, athletic build (not skinny but have muscles). the sweater fits great, just like glove, it does not make me look fat. the quality is great,sweater is warm, cozy and well-made. i am not sure about color as it's brighter as it shown. it is not quite coral, it's a little bit darker which will make it difficult to match it with. the sleeves run small so if you are taller then me just keep it in mind. th sw"
2780	4	a	I ordered an xxs online and it's still massive. the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup. the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning.
2781	4	a	I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!
2782	4	a	Love this sweater! it can be used for both work and casual wear with ease. very soft and seems durable. i highly recommend it!
2783	1	a	"I found this dress to run large (like the other reviewers have mentioned). the quality is really nice, and the sweater fabric is a nice touch. it hit me right above the knee, and i an 5'5"". it is a purplish pink (as pictured). if it fits you properly, you will be pleased with the quality, color and unique style."
2784	2	a	Bought this for my girlfriend and she couldn't be happier! she's a size 4/34c and the small fits perfectly and is so flattering and comfortable. highly recommend.
2785	0	a	"Unlike the other reviewers, i did not have any problem with the sizing, fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think it's suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 5'8"", 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good."
2786	0	a	I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable. however, while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist. i will acknowledge i'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs, but was hopeful these pants wouldn't cling to them. for reference, i'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants.
2787	0	a	I love these pants. they are a beautiful color and very well made. i like the fit and the style very much.
2788	4	a	I was very excited about ordering this top as i'm tall girl (6 ft) and i like my back well covered. i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material. this top is incredibly thin and see through. though fabric is nice and soft, it feels more like a pajama top. all curves & bumps immediately stand out and it doesn't look flattering. i ordered 2 colors grey and black size large and returned both, although they were true to size
2789	1	a	"I bought this dress in three different patterns, i love it so much! i am 5'7"" and around 135 pounds. usually a size six or eight in dresses. ordered the small and fits perfectly if a little bit. curvy frame. great for women on the busty side. fits beautiful and is stretchy but not too clingy."
2790	4	a	I purchased this in both the green color and the grey color and am in love with both. they are much longer than last years design and it has a pretty weave to the sweater with multiple layers that sit perfectly past the hips. the fit is true to size although the fabric is quite thin and i worry about pulls. also, the sleeves are a bit long, but this doesn't bother me too much at this point. very versatile!
2791	4	a	It's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch. color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted.
2792	4	a	"I didn't end up keeping this, and i feel like i might regret it. ;) i have a similar sweater. this jacket is super streamlined with a sleek fit. the bummer for me was that it didn't have snaps to hold the collar down to the jacket when it was unzipped, so the flaps seemed to flop around. the s was perfect. not too tight. i'm 5'8"", 140 lbs, 34c."
2793	1	a	Love the way this looked online/on model. would not recommend for a shorter or curvy person such as myself. it just ended up looking like a very chic potato sack on me, and was not flattering.
2794	4	a	Kicky little pleat in the back is interesting and comfortable. great fit, good colors and doesn't wrinkle easily.
2795	4	a	I love how pretty and soft this shirt is. it falls well. i want to wear it everyday.
2796	4	a	Light and airy. runs really small. had to go up 2 sizes. a little pricy but overall a cute blouse. not your typical blouse.
2797	4	a	Ok, received this in the mail yesterday and tried on this morning, i ordered the size 2 snd it is really big. i notice that the armhole sag and there is a lot of extra room everywhere. i am a 32d on the top so that is why i ordered the size 2, but i will return this and order the size 0 and i hope that will take care of the sagging arm area
2798	1	a	"Totally agree with the other reviewer!  just got this in the mail today and it is a beautiful dress but it does run one size too small.  i am always a size 8 in maeve but couldn't zip this one up!  and at 5""7' it is a tad short but i'm exchanging it for the 10 in the hope that in the next size it will be a bit longer--and that it will fit!  but it is a super flattering fit!!  and the blue color pops! a stunning dress and love that it's machine washable!"
2799	0	a	The linen- cotton blend breathes so well for a hot summer day! the design on the waistline is super cute and yes they are a little long in the leg but that can be a plus+ for vertically challenged girls like me. wedges and platforms are perfect to show off the soft drape of the pant legs. now that they're on sale, i'm snatching up other colors, like white and light khaki- already have the seersucker blue pair!
2800	2	a	I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod. this one didn't work for me. i ordered the medium. the top is very small--i would recommend only for b cup or smaller. the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape. it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter. sending this one back! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit.
2801	1	a	This dress is extremely body conscious. so if you want to make an impression, wear this dress. the fabric is thick and best worn on a cooler night. the pattern is gorgeously done, pieced together like a garment three times the cost. the cut of the armholes might not be flattering on those with broad shoulders or chubby upper arms (like myself). for me this dress is tts but way too long, so i will have to hem.
2802	1	a	This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however, if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c), the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well.
2803	1	a	I thought this was love at first sight. the color and design are both stunning. and it drapes just perfectly over the body without looking like a tent. and the fabric feels nice, but the very first time i put it on, it snagged on my fingernail (and my nails are kept short and neat). this wouldn't have been a problem, except that the snag is very obvious. this material seems like it's going to snag on every single thing. i didn't dare even try on a necklace for this reason. i'm really undecided o
2804	1	a	First off, this runs very large. i'm normally an 8 and sized down to the 6 but probably could have done a 4. it looked like a tent on me. the top part is lovely, i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering. this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now.
2805	2	a	This was such a cute suit but strange how they designed it. top runs super low and it almost did not cover my breast area. runs small. i had to return because fit was way to small for a large suit.
2806	2	a	I am obsessed with peplum down coats because the ones you usually see have no shape and are extremely unflattering. i was excited for this to arrive. this is quite nice and it looks more feminine than the other down coats out there. the coat itself runs just true to my shirt size but not what i want for a coat. i will be returning this for a size up because i will want to wear a sweater or at least maybe a thicker shirt under this especially for winter or fall. the fabric is decent and the weigh
2807	0	a	"I am not usually a khaki type of pant person but these are really cute and have interesting details such as the buttons at the ankles. they are also quite flattering and do not ""bag"" out after a day of wearing. i am 5'6"" and about 130lbs. the size 2s fit great. i purchased the ""green"" color and it goes well with a number of tops. these can be dressed up with heels and great to run around on the weekend. the material is soft which is always a plus for me. overall a great purchase."
2808	1	a	I had only planned to check out this dress at the store but ended up buying it then and there! not a deal breaker but there were extra threads hanging from some parts of the dress. it made me a bit concern that the stitching would unravel during wear. so far, so good! i wish they had paid more attention to little details like that.
2809	4	a	I ordered this pullover in green, size large. the color is lovely and the fabric feels great. however, it was tight (even though i often wear a medium). unfortunately it will be going back.
2810	1	a	"The fabric is so soft and completely lined; the straps are adjustable. this is the best summer dress ever!!! so comfortable and easy to just throw on. goes with a multitude of colors for your sandals and bags. i love this dress! i'm 5' 7"", 137 lbs., and ordered a size medium, with plenty of room around the bust; no worry about arm holes being too big because you adjust the straps to suit your body. i love the below the knee length. i like comfy but you could easily size down. nice embroidery"
2811	4	a	Super large and a very weird cut.  the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me.
2812	4	a	I was so bummed when this came in...the colors and print are beautiful, but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic/ruffle combo. there is also a liner which is a nice touch, but it's significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts. definitely going back.
2813	0	a	Pilcro from retailer is a great alternative to the premium denim lines with a way better price point! similar cut & quality with awesome rises and spandex/stretch content! also, the styles are always on trend!
2814	1	a	This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more. it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days. it fits tts. well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay ( as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with). the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail.  sure to sell out.
2815	4	a	"I wore this for the first time this weekend and loved it. it is long and lean but not baggy or tent like. i'm 6'0"" so i appreciate the length and fit.  will get a lot of use out of this. good w/ skinny jeans and i can't seem to have enough black tops."
2816	0	a	Lightweight and cute. these pants do run on the larger side, which is fine is you like a more relaxed look. i usually wear a 10-12 in pants and i had to exchange the large for a medium which fit much better. great for summer weather!
2817	4	a	Very comfortable sweater. the material is very soft and not itchy at all. i had the hardest time deciding between sizes. the medium was slightly longer and loose through the arms. a bit of a boxy shape. the small was slightly more fitted through the arms and instead of hanging straight had a slight fit and flare look to it but still loose. ended up going with a small since it was less boxy. it's a sweater that can look more put together or more laid back just depending on sizing but overall love
2818	4	a	This is every bit as lovely as shown! the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks, lace embellishment's and covered buttons. for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) my normal size. i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area. going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts. i think it's a wonderful rendition of a denim top. this would work in any season of the year.
2819	2	a	I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which, for me, m
2820	4	a	I purchased the black tunic. as others have mentioned, this piece goes great with skinny jeans or leggings. when i'm rushing to find something to wear, this is one of my go-to's. nice coverage. not see-through.
2821	4	a	I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.
2822	4	a	I wear this vest two ways - over a long sleeve shirt when it's warmer and layered over a shirt and cardigan when it's cooler. it's the perfect amount of warmth when i'm running errands and don't want to wear a heavy coat. love it and plan to wear it a lot!
2823	5	a	Wonderful print and color. dress style is very boxy and oversized, fabric is great but has no drape.
2824	1	a	This dress pops! gorgeous colors and simple, classic flowy design. i thought it ran a little big, i ended up with xs for best overall fit in chest and a more streamline flow. 34b for reference.
2825	1	a	I love this dress! the print and the fabric make it a fun, uncomplicated outfit choice that can be dressed up or down very easily. that being said, there are two issues i wish i had known about, although i probably would have purchased anyway. 1) it has pockets -yay!!! but also, the pockets create a bulge where they hit my hips and it's not a flattering spot on me to have an extra bulge. 2) i washed before wearing because it was super wrinkled and me and the iron aren't friends anymore. so i thr
2826	4	a	This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.
2827	1	a	I love the simplicity of this. it's not fussy at all. i fell in love with the green color online. fortunately someone had returned a green to my closest store though it wasn't my size. the color is even better in person.i tried on the blue (also pretty) in a 8 and 10, as i'm all over the place in retailer sizing. i could've taken either but the 10 had too much material on top for me. i ordered the 8. i'm hoping it won't be too short for church.
2828	0	a	"I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight, totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you've owned them for years, they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on.  ---------- i am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans, and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well. i do not have an hourglass figure (my shou"
2829	1	a	"This dress is amazing! it fits true to size, very flattering and the fabric is beautiful! i am 5'4"" and it felt a little long for me so i am having it hemmed up one inch, but others may like the hemline just as it is. i like my dresses just right above my knee and it was hitting in the middle of my knee. just love everything about it and would definitely recommend it highly!"
2830	4	a	I tried this top on in the store and didn't buy it because i was in a hurry. obsessed about it and it was sold out when i went back. so happy i was able to get it online, it's beautiful. i got a medium and it fits perfectly, enough room that it hangs nicely but not baggy, i'm typically a medium in shirts at retailer. it looks beautiful with high waisted black pants. i wear a cami underneath. i own it in white and tried it on with a black bra only and it looked great, i just didn't feel comfortable
2831	5	a	"I want to hate these jeans because they are so expensive but every time i try these on they just look so cool.  they seem to be handmade so the flowers are not in the same spot on each pair."
2832	4	a	I ordered in this in the kelly green and loved it so much i wore it the very next day after it came in the mail. the green color is gorgeous and easily complements so many other colors in my wardrobe. the cardigan itself is super comfy and i love the full length long-sleeves! so many cardigans these days come with 3/4 length sleeves, which are fine, but sometimes you want a long sleeve. the fit almost runs on the larger side, but i think that a slightly looser look works well for this cardigan,
2833	4	a	This looks sooooo much better on, than on the hanger/in the picture. i bought the grey, and it is the most comfortable tunic i've ever worn. it is light, airy, and so easy to wear. i wish it came in more prints/colors, cause i'd buy another one, in a skinny minute! if you don't try this on, you're missing out on a surprisingly awesome wardrobe piece. you can wear it year-round with jeans, pants, a vest, wrap, scarves, leggings, boots, sandals or anything else, and it looks chic and whimsical. go
2834	5	a	Never spent this much on a dress so it needs to be amazing for me to keep it.  i've never seen flannel patterns and colors like this. the details in the back are unique. but in the end, i decided to return because it's too long and although it fit fine in a size large it didn't look that great on me. the dress has an exaggerated drop waist that was too low for my short waisted frame. the fabric smells odd. i tried belting it but the pockets and back buttons created bulk.
2835	4	a	I would never had bought this top if i hadn't seen it previously in the store. the look in the picture is not flattering at all (too frumpy with the wide pants). the many details work well with pastel tones. very bohemian look so make sure you balance that with modern bottoms and edgy shoes. might be a problem washing it because all of the details: mini pearls and golden thread but you got to do what you got to do...
2836	4	a	I love this shirt's color which is a lovely yellow. the fit is nice and flowing. i usually wear xs but intentionally bought s, so that it would be a little lose and i may wear with leggings. my one issue is how transparent it is. i opt to wear a spaghetti strap underneath it, however some women might be ok wearing it alone.
2837	3	a	I tried this on (in the store) on a whim....then had to have it!! i'm normally a small but really loved the way the medium fit. good thing because it was the last jacket like it in the store!! super soft, comfy...a great purchase!! fur is removable for easy washing or a different look!!!
2838	4	a	"This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin, it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so it's not flattering at all. at $78, it's really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what wouldn't?), but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. i'm 5'9"" and not well-endowed (a b), so it did nothing for me..  also, the online picture of the moss version looks like it's a grey/black combo. it's not... it is really green"
2839	1	a	I'm pregnant (2nd trimester) and really wanted a beautiful, non-maternity dress. i got this in ivory and it's just perfect. the lace on the sleeves is really comfortable, i love the fit, and i love the length. i got tons of compliments on it. my only regret is that i didn't also get it in slate and i really wishing it would get re-stocked.
2840	0	a	Great fit and style. the color is perfect for spring, they have a nautical feel to them.
2841	4	a	"I tried this tunic at a store and loved it. i had to buy a much bigger size because the sleeves are so narrow. the 12 fit ok but the sleeves are so tight it hurt. i have normal arms and i am so glad i was at a store to try a bigger size."
2842	4	a	I bought this shirt in black and it goes with everything. definitely runs large-i have big boobs and bought the xl and returned it for the large which was even still a bit too big (long running in the sleeves) though i was comfortable with keeping it. it's a soft, comfortable shirt. the snap detail is quirky and allows multiple looks/ styling. i love the shirt and i'm glad i got in on it while i did.
2843	4	a	This top is very cute, but i found it runs small in the bust, which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up, if you have a generous bust.
2844	1	a	I was so excited to receive this jumpsuit as it looks so elegant and i love the lattice back. as soon as it arrived i set about unbuttoning it to try it on. 10 minutes and 2 broken fingernails later i got done. when i tried it on i found that it fit everywhere except the bust which was much too tight and i am not a busty person. so back it goes. even if it had fit, i do not think i could have handled the hassle of those buttons. why they didn't design it with a hidden zipper on the side and kept
2845	4	a	Got so many complements! really comfy but runs big! i'm usually a large and i wish i had gotten the small.
2846	1	a	I had seen this online a few times and while it caught my eye because of the color, i never really bothered to check out the details due to the stock photo. it looks quite bland as it doesn't really flatter the model. however, once i saw this dress in-store, i was drawn to it immediately. the dress is well made, the embroidery is delicate and beautiful with interesting design features. i love the combination of the summer dress with a collar. it makes this dress so work appropriate as well as it
2847	1	a	Beautiful dusty rose color! the fit is fabulous! love the sleeve and hem length! very flattering and does not cling.
2848	0	a	I originally bought these jeans in my true size. after wearing them a few times i realized they stretched out quickly making it hard to wear them again. retailer recommended i go down a size and now they are my favorite jean!  they are a little tight for the first 5 mins, and then they are perfect fit wear after wear. and so soft!
2849	5	a	"First, this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.  however, there are several items to note. primarily, this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves."
2850	4	a	"Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your ""normal"" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love"
2851	4	a	"This tank is super amazing. very versatile - wore to work with dress pants and flats, and wore out to dinner with jeans and heels. a bit out of my comfort zone since it is a ""swing"" tank, but love the color and cut! perfect for professional life and going out on the town. i did choose a petite in this due to the long armholes (even though i have a long torso for my body size)."
2852	1	a	This dress is cute and comfortable. big but not too big, skimming. i usually wear a 12 pant and bought a medium and it is great. i am on the taller side and the length was great too.
2853	1	a	This dress is amazing. i bought it for an afternoon wedding i'm attending, it's perfect! it fits like a glove and the lace is so delicate. the nude sheath really allows the lace and all the details to stand out. love it in the black!
2854	1	a	I bought this dress for the kentucky derby. i was worried about wearing navy to an event known for bright colors, but the gorgeous lace and rosettes are light and beautiful. i paired it with a lavender hat, and i was ready for a mint julep! i usually wear a 2 or a 4, so i ordered both. the 2 fit best. i will be wearing this dress to a wedding in the fall and for many events for years to come. stunning!
2855	4	a	I did not have the issue that a previous reviewer did, there were ruffles on my shirt. the one thing i didn't know was how wide the top ran. i ordered my usual size 8 and it fit with no problems. i'm a 36b. the only thing is that in the model shot, the shirt is tucked into the pants and you don't get to see the full volume of it. even the model shot of the shirt from the back doesn't show the wide sleeves and body of the shirt. its not a big problem, since the shirt can be tucked but i will have
2856	4	a	This shirt dress has the right amount of body skimming drape and length to flatter my short potbellied square waisted self, i wish they made more versions more colors more sleeves!
2857	0	a	"Omg! so comfortable and feels like wearing nothing at all! i wish the blue print was still available in my size. tried them on at the store and fell in love! they say the length is 31.5, however i am on the tall side, usually wear 34"" in jeans, but these are perfect. i see from other reviews that these pants have been around for a while. please don't change them, and i will be getting another pair or two next year!!!"
2858	0	a	"I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition, the ""brocade"" is a very lightweight polyestery, tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted, it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me, not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past, including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews, but have no regret"
2859	2	a	This robe is one of the best purchases i have made in the past year. i would also add that it is much cuter in person than pictured on the model. usually things look better on the models, but not this one. i have a tough time finding robes and sleepwear in petite sizes (thank you, retailer!). this robe is sooooo soft and cuddly, without being too heavy. the teal color is so pretty and the hemstitch detail is nice. i hate taking this off in the morning to get dressed.
2860	4	a	Love this shirt! i have it in both colors. you can wear it off the shoulder or on. it's baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans, i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough, you couldn't see i had drains underneath my tank top. i am really grateful for this shirt! super soft, super cute!
2861	1	a	I am 5'3, 120 lbs and i got xs petite. it fits beautifully and hits me a couple inches above my ankle bone. as stated in my review title, the material is quite heavy and great quality, which helps it hang nicely. cut high enough under the armholes and snug enough under the arms and across the top of my chest so the fullness at the bottom is proportional. love it with my lace-up espadrilles!
2862	3	a	This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'4 and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.
2863	1	a	This knit dress is very comfortable. i liked the various colors used in the stripes. my only issue with it, is that the skirt of the dress flares out oddly and is quite short. in my opinion, this dress, with its sturdy fabric and long sleeves, would appear more proportional with a longer skirt. skirt length, along with horizontal stripes just did not work for me. regrettably, i sent it back.
2864	1	a	Well made dress, but too much fabric for my taste. it lays a little heavy on the body & does not give a slimming affect. the colors are vibrant & pretty, but the dress is too long, as well. as other reviewers have said, the front is too low cut, but turn it around and it looks & feels better. didn't work for me, sadly, i'll be returning it.
2865	4	a	Adorable sweater with a loose knit that helps slim down my man-back appearance. cut is tapered to the body but with a soft flare at the bottom hem. not clingy, very soft fabric doesn't accentuate bulges so i am happy about it's forgiving silhouette.
2866	4	a	This shirt is nice and flowy. it can be dressed up or down. very lightweight for summer, but the color will work for early fall too.
2867	4	a	This top is so comfortable and better quality than i expected. ruffles fall nicely over your sholulder and there is a fabric underarm, i don't have to wear a tank top underneath like i normally would with tops with wide opening around arms. color is beautiful too, i really love it. true to size.
2868	0	a	"Unlike the other reviews, i love this skirt. the lining is a nice stretchy material, as is the eyelet overlay, making it a really easy to wear, and comfortable skirt while still looking polished and professional.    i bought it so that its slim fitting, more like a pencil skirt.  i've only worn it to work dressed up, with boots, but suspect i'll get a lot of use in the summer with flip flops and a tee shirt.  i highly recommend it, and think it's a great price.  it is longer than on the mode"
2869	1	a	I tried a regular 0 in-store and it was more billowy than i would like. i'm usually a size 2/4 and 5ft tall. i ordered a petite 00 and i'm hoping the fit will be more snug and that the length will be more proportional to me (the reg 0 hit just above my knee, but it might be cuter mid-thigh). it's a cute dress that can be dressed up or down and i hope it will work out.
2870	0	a	"Pros. 1) the color and texture of this skirt are gorgeous. twice as pretty as the photo . 2) you could wear this with almost any color top, black boots and youve got a great outfit! 3) the black side panels make this a very figure flattering skirt.  cons this skirt is unlined. because it's a knit skirt on some mesh it's slightly seethrough. i'll wear it with a slip, but seriously for this price it should be lined"
2871	4	a	"If all the tops i ordered from retailer this summer, this top is my fav. it is a crowd pleaser! my friend called it my ""art shirt."" the fabric is nice and the cut hangs nice on my 5 ft 5 170 pound frame. the armholes are a little big, so i just wear a red bra with it and it's great."
2872	0	a	It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer. as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailer's pants are cut for slim figured women, this rare pair of pants crosses the divide, flattering both shapes. i usually have to look for xls. here, i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l. these pants are great. they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections. they will be my go to summer pant. i love them.
2873	1	a	"Yes! yes! yes!  i buy a lot of dresses from retailer, and about once a year i hit the jackpot with a dress that hits all the marks! this dress is it!  i bought the white linen version on a whim. i never buy white dress because, 1. i don't want to look bigger than my pear shape already is, and 2. i like red wine and i that's risky in a white dress!   i don't know how this designer did it, but this dress is amazing! it's slimming and flattering and summery and current. and i am two sizes bigger"
2874	1	a	This dress fits very nicely, i didn't keep it as i have too many dresses, but loved the fit. hip was a little looser compared to the top, you can almost see it on the model if you look closely, the dies poke out a bit. the teal color is very flattering on my pale skin tone. love the back, you can actually zip it all the way (mid back) with the tie in the neck, leaving a nice cutout... 0p fit me (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist) 30 dd).
2875	1	a	I thought i would take a chance even though reviews suggested tricky sizing issues. unfortunately it's true, it was very tight at the waist and bust even though i sized up to a size 8. i took it back to the store.
2876	4	a	I ordered this top (black) in both small and medium; i can get usually away with small at retailer but am size medium in all other stores. as soon as i received the package and opened it up, i knew i would keep this top. it has a gorgeous texture to it, a slight sheen, and is well made. it's extremely comfortable as a t-shirt would be, but has more structure and looks very chic. the waist nips in just enough to give the flutter hem a little flare at the hips and is very feminine. i have a long tor
2877	4	a	Cute top. i always get compliments when i wear it. a little boxy in style
2878	1	a	This dress has a great design for any frame. it looks great with a belt to accentuate the waist but the dress stands great alone and doesn't require a lot of styling.
2879	0	a	I really liked these jeans. i had to return though. they run small. i normally wear a 27 and could have gone for a 28 in these. maybe it was because i went for the petite. they can run a bit smaller.
2880	4	a	Ordered med petite. love the print & design but it runs really big more like a large and length of top is not flattering . returning
2881	4	a	Very nice material, soft and feminine colors. however, the waist sat higher than my natural waist and was uncomfortable. unfortunately it's going back
2882	4	a	I saw online and bought in white and moss! moss is darker in person. i am 106, 5'1 but a 30f and the top fits very well. it actually minimized my chest which i love! not sure how well this would fit on small-chested ladies. not super clingy in the midsection but will look nice with pants or skirts. super happy!
2883	2	a	The softest cotton gauze but, not see through. relaxed but, the sleeves & neckline make it flattering. a gorgeous blue in person. so in love with this dress, going back for it in white!
2884	0	a	I love everything about this jumper - it's so comfortable without being too warm. it's easy to dress up with booties and a hat. i suppose the only possible downside is that it's slightly tight at the ankles, but honestly - this is like a dream.
2885	4	a	If you're a curvy girl like me this shirt is very flattering. hangs nicely in the front, not too clingy. also has that accordian back which is very nice because it hides my back fat. the plum is gorgeous! was king it for the first time so can't yet comment on how it holds up with washing or whether the back retains its accordian loom with the hang to dry recommendation.
2886	4	a	This top is very light weight and comfortable. i am normally a 8/10 in tops due to my bust size but ordered a 6 based on other reviews. it fits great. i really like the fit and the pattern. it has been a great summer shirt and i can see myself grabbing for it in the fall paired with skinny jeans and a cute bootie.
2887	4	a	This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.
2888	1	a	Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.
2889	4	a	I just received the acacia swing tank and when i pulled it out, i felt like it was christmas day all over. it hangs nicely and felt luxurious on my skin. even my husband was dazzled. the detailing of the flowers is delicate and feminine. the cutaway gives you a sexy, casual chic appearance that you can dress up or down. i can't wait to unveil this new piece at work.
2890	4	a	"I saw this shirt online, loved it, but unfortunately it was sold out in the regular size small. however, retailer shirts tend to be long on me, so i ordered a petite small. it fits great! i am actually happy i got a petite because i feel a regular would have been too long. the shirt comes to my hips. for reference i'm 5'8"" 145 lbs. and my measurements are 34-27-38."
2891	1	a	This dress is extremely comfortable and the material is very soft. i was worried it would be too clingy but it hangs nicely. the length is just right, although the pockets hit below my hips. i was a little unsure of the bold pattern but i liked it better in person. i bought it to wear on an upcoming beach vacation but now i plan to pair it with flats and sweaters for the fall.
2892	4	a	Relaxed fit, soft and comfortable. interesting design but material is extremely thin. if i had purchased this at full price, i probably would have returned it. it seems more like a pajama top...
2893	2	a	This sweater would have been a better fit for me if the sleeves were slightly larger and had a button/snap on the front. the material is soft and comfortable. black pairs well with jeans.
2894	1	a	I bought this dress to wear to a funeral. i usually wear a medium but when i tried it on it was way too big so i exchanged it for a small which fit perfectly! the side slits make the dress a bit sexy and the styling is boxy but very comfortable especially with the pockets! the fabric lies beautifully on the body. i would recommend this dress.
2895	3	a	I remember seeing this great jackets online and knowing that i would have to have it! so i traveled to the store to try it on. the ruffle on the bottom was beautiful and fluffy and just like the pictures. the color was perfect and it was lightweight enough i could get more uses out of it that most of my coats in the texas heat. so i tried on the small. the didn't quite button over my bust, and i did an arm wiggle that made the arms too tight near where they met my body. no problem, medium it is.
2896	1	a	"I bought the blue dress, though the ""blue"" dress was a little more like grey according to my husband and i. the quality of the fabric was quite nice.  i have to return the dress because it does not fit me around the bust. i consider myself to have a good size bust (not huge), but the dress seems to expect quite a bit smaller.   i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual, which is what i wanted, but i guess i just wouldn't call it at all pretty."
2897	1	a	The dress is beautiful in pictures, but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly, had to return.
2898	4	a	"This top is so soft and luxuriously comfy! i love wearing it around the house, haven't really ""dressed"" it up yet with jeans or jewelry. it runs slightly big, but if you like the oversized look, this is definitely perfect."
2899	1	a	"I tried this dress on and felt amazing in it.  i got home and showed my husband my purchases.  i told him i wasn't sure if i should have bought this one and told him to be honest with me.  he said it looked great and he was glad i bought it.  so great for a spring wedding. fits true to size.  i am 125 5'4"" c-cup and i bought my normal size 0.  this made my waist look really small."
2900	0	a	"These are my favorite pair of capris/ankle jeans ever! i'm 5'4"", 120lbs and got the 28 petite in gray. the fit is fantastic and the length is perfect for summer days (couple inches above my ankles). the gray color is so versatile and i can dress it up or down. i plan on getting it in other colors as well since the fit is so good."
2901	1	a	The length is lovely, the color is nice, the fabric feels like silk but isn't (so you can wash it), and the cut is flattering if you're a b cup or below. for me, the pleats on top made my chestiness look like fattiness.
2902	4	a	I have a narrow face, and most coats with the big collars overwhelm me. this proportion is perfect. follows my shape without constricting but flows so well for a good line. color isn't quite laden green; it's more teal which works even better for me. so hard to find a wool coat these days that isn't bulky.
2903	1	a	I was so excited to receive this dress! it even has embroidered loops on the hem of the slip underneath which was such a cute detail. it's very pretty on. that being said, i ordered a size 4 which fit me perfectly (150 lbs) but ladies, i do not mean this in any way but in my personal opinion, my arms are out of shape. not toned and flabby. the sleeves on this dress will not do you any justice. it will make your arms look worse because of the shape of the sleeve. so keep that in consideration if
2904	0	a	"Such a cute skirt! the fabric is comfortable and light, and the the tie in the front helps conceal some of those ""tummy issues"" a lot of people want to hide. :)"
2905	1	a	"Very pretty dress and a bit different than what we see in the shops! i found the material to be very nice, despite one of the reviewers comments. it is a sheath that is not skin tight but shows curves - great for dancing. also i did not find the neck too tight - fits fine. tts as normally a petite 6 which is a wonderful fit and sometimes a petite 4 or 8 depending on the cut. the 8 was too large. all in all a feminine uncommon dress. looking forward to wearing it to one of the 6 weddings th"
2906	1	a	"I just received my dress yesterday and it is gorgeous!!! i actually ordered 2 sizes, 00p and 0p, depending on some cuts i'm between those 2 sizes, i am 5'1 92 lbs but with holidays eating i have gained 4 pounds so far, so the 00p was bit too tight all way from hips to bust area, i was able to zip it up but was a bit painful to keep breathing and got some weird wrinkles on the back between waist line and derriã©re. the dress is a beautiful cocktail of sexy curvy silhouette with the baroque flavor"
2907	0	a	Love these jeans, comfortable fit and material is soft.. fit true to size and have a good rise.
2908	4	a	"I saw this in the store on a mannequin in baltimore.....and i had to try it. it almost felt more like a sweatshirt than a true sweater. i found the top to be a shaped. smaller at the shoulders and chest and widening as it went down. the sleeves were rolled up which showed a soft peachy look underneath, which was cute. but i am on the fence on to which size to go with. like other reviewers have said, if you go up a size for shoulder comfort it gets a bit too swingy on the bottom. the length was n"
2909	5	a	"Dress is beautiful in person, light material that is excellent for summer.  this dress is not forgiving in the chest, so ladies if you bigger chested i suggest going up a size or two. i'm 5'4, 145 lbs and 34ddd, i usually wear 8 or 10, this dress in a 10 made my look like i was wearing an unflattering sports bra."
2910	2	a	I had high hopes with the other good reviews, but you just don't know how amazing this is until you put it on! just so soft and cozy! i am so excited for more saturday/sunday products at retailer!
2911	4	a	I bought the green motif and the colors are beautiful and look just like the picture. as others have mentioned, it does have a high slit on the side that has a tendency to separate and look bulky. i just put a couple of small hooks to keep it together. i normally would wear a medium or large, but based on other reviews, i ordered down to the small and it was perfect. since i live in the south where it can stay quite warm through fall, it will be a great transitional piece.
2912	0	a	"So there weren't any product reviews to go by when i ordered the last small. i had no way of knowing if it ran big, small, or tts. i'm usually a med, but to my surprise the small worked due to the fluid pleating. it sits right on my natural waistline similar to the model and not too short in length (i'm 5'8""). i also like the med weight of the fabric it moves freely when you walk, but not too light. it is similar to a double weight georgette or crepe."
2913	0	a	Online photos do not do this skirt any justice i agree with a previous poster. i normally never buy anything brown, but there are pops of teal and magenta throughout. you can't see the gorgeous shimmer and the interesting layered colors online. in addition, this skirt has a stretch waistband (plus for the holidays!) and is so flattering, not too tight, but shows just enough of your curves, physique. i like that the skirt is longer as well - will look cute with boots. i purchased the size medium
2914	2	a	I do wish this came in a 30dd sizing, purchased he 32d and it fits, though the band is looser than desired. i am still keeping it. i love the back, will be great for some of my dresses ti used to wear strapless bras to wear. recommend.
2915	1	a	I am normally a size 8 in dresses and bought this in a small. so if you are a smaller person, this would likely be a bit loose on you. the color was odd. i liked the navy blue, but the pink was a pepto bismol colored pink. i just felt like i would get sick of the color/pattern after one wear. the fit is cute and comfy.
2916	4	a	This product is comfortable and stylish. i love the design and the color print. i can dresss it up and dress it down. it goes with everything and also fits great.
2917	3	a	I love this piece !   i purchased it on sale months ago and when  i wear it i just love it!!  it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect it's very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing  i'm very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine  would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices   thx retailer!
2918	4	a	"Loved the idea of this top--but it just won't work for me. it's really big. i'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs. a small should be fine, but i'm swimming in this. the back is pretty (i tried it on with a white cami), but it looks very maternity on me. tried to order the xs, but it's sold out. too bad. was a cute idea. not too thin for summer."
2919	4	a	Beautiful color and  soft material but runs a little big so size down. i loved that it was complementing to my figure without making me look larger
2920	4	a	This top fits loosely through the body and a little snigger in the bust. fabric is nice but does require some ironing/steaming at times. it is a little pricey but you won't find anything similar so being unique makes it worth the cost. i ordered online but it was available at my local retailer store; unfortunately the online order didn't show availability & i would have liked to see it first since i was unsure of size ( usually wear medium if top has a relaxed fit, large if not). very cute too!
2921	4	a	The first day i wore this jacket to work, three people told me how great it looked. it's stylish but comfy, looks great worn with a tunic and leggings or accompanying a skirt and tights. best of all, the camel color is a great change from black and as a bonus, doesn't show my orangeish lab's dog hair!
2922	1	a	I was thoroughly underwhelmed. it did not hang well, and the fit seemed off. the tie waist just sort of hung there. i could have sized down, but i didn't even want to bother. it was pretty boring and flimsy for $138.
2923	4	a	Received this product with a gaping hole in it. very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse
2924	4	a	It was very pretty,but it ran very big , sadly i had to return it.
2925	2	a	This bra is just as cute in person as it is in the pic! i can tell it's pretty well made and i love that it has a lot of little details like on the straps and the cute front-closure and lacy racerback. it also fits pretty true to size, which is a must for me because i often get bras that leave my boobs spilling out. however, this bra isn't the comfiest even though it looks like it would be pretty comfy in the picture.the style doesn't look too stiff or anything and the size i got isn't too tight
2926	0	a	While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item, these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online, the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.
2927	4	a	I love this brand and their different styles of tshirts. extremely soft, washes well and wears well! the shirt runs a bit large and i usually wear a medium, but in this brand i am a extra small or small.
2928	4	a	Very cute top and so comfortable! it runs big i'm between a medium and large. i ordered the large and it's definitely a little big but wearable. i probably should've swapped it for a medium but it's still really cute!
2929	4	a	I saw both of these blouses several months earlier and anxiously waited for them to go on sale. definitely worth the wait. the quality and designs are superb true to size
2930	4	a	I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric...it's very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse. will be returning it.
2931	4	a	Looked really cute on line. arrived with a large hole in the front! quality and look was very cheap!!! would not recommend this sweater at all. step it up please retailer!
2932	4	a	This shirt is just so easy breezy! i got the blue motif and love the pattern. the top is loose but it's supposed to fit that way. i have a feeling this will be my go to for the spring summer! i'm about 136lbs and ordered a small.
2933	0	a	"So i ordered both sizes in this, small and xs.  i'm 128 lbs. and 5""4 and the xs fit me.  at first i wasn't sure about this piece but after getting it on it starts to grow on you.  the top part of the jumper fits really cute and the bottoms are very wide and can be long.  i did get this at a great price so i'm going to keep it, don't know how many times i will end up wearing but thought it would be really cute to wear out on date night with my husband."
2934	1	a	Gorgeous, but so big. i got eh pxs and it's like a mumu. i wiill return
2935	2	a	This dress fits wonderfully. i can wear it causally or dress it up if i want to. great deal as well.
2936	1	a	So much prettier in person! beautiful colors matched together! so light and relaxing! love at first sight!
2937	0	a	These shorts are great, both the design and fit are beautiful. i would say that these run true to size, i bought my usual size, 26, and they fit perfectly. they fit a little high waisted, which i love. the material is so soft and are so comfortable. i would recommend these shorts if you're thinking about it!
2938	0	a	These are worth the money! gorgeous fit, soft denim, and make my body look long and sleek (especially my bottom). i wear mine w a white tee underneath and plan to add booties for the fall but for now, platform clogs. fabulous.
2939	1	a	I bought this dress in store today in a size 4, i usually wear an 8 (so i was thrilled) the print and details are gorgeous but it's a very wide swing dress, there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist. i'm going to wear this with a belt so it's fine but the images online are a little misleading.
2940	4	a	This blouse drapes nicely. the 8 in the store was too big which is not what i usually find with maeve. i wear a 6 or small in most blouses. i ordered the 6 and it was still too big, so i hope the 4 will work.
2941	0	a	Absolutely gorgeous shirt. the quality is outstanding! only problem is that it is too small. i am usually a perfect size 6 and this will not zip. returning for a size 8. you won't regret buying it!
2942	1	a	I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a 2 and because of the stretch in it, it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.
2943	4	a	The quality is good, as is the design idea, but, practically, it doesn't work. ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly. this top is not soft or flowy, it is stiff and very wide.
2944	4	a	I love this top! i typically wear a size small and this is very true to size. it's loose fitting but does not make you look large. the pattern on the material is also fun without being too busy. perfect for fall!
2945	5	a	"Love this dress! paid full price and completely worth it. fit tts for me- i'm 5'8"" 135 lbs., with a slim upper body so i had no issues with the neck being tight. definitely would be braless or need a strapless bra. gorgeous material, light and breezy dress. best retailer purchase in a long time!"
2946	1	a	Retailer has incredible service, and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however, this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use, so i first tried hand washing it. however, the black part of the dress came off on the white part, making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful, striking dress (that would be great maternit
2947	1	a	This dress is absolutely beautiful. i wear with with a flat shoes gold. i got a lot of complaints. i was witing the fall season finale antro bringing what i want.
2948	4	a	This is a great, effortless top. you can dress it up or down and fits true to size. it's forgiving and the straps draw your eye to the most flattering part of the body. the fabric is stretchy and and comfortable.
2949	1	a	"I love cloth and stone and the softness and prettiness of this fabric did not disappoint. this is not a dress, however. it is a long shirt. the sides were so short the you could see where my bum and hamstrings came together. leggings would ruin the look and as a shirt it would be totally impractical. for reference i am 5'8"" and 130 lbs. the small was the correct size, save for the length."
2950	5	a	In love! just wow. beautiful colors although they're dark you can still see all the variations. the flannel is light and not too heavy. there's visible black lace just below the shoulder. pretty buttons. ordered the large, my normal size and it's a perfect fit. roomy but not oversized. so well made i think this will be a favorite for years.
2951	0	a	I almost bought this skirt yesterday in store, but decided against it because the fabric was subpar. the skirt i tried on was snagged and unraveled. i selected another skirt, which i purchased. as the sales associate was folding the skirt, i noticed that this one was also snagged and unraveling. despite loving the style and fit, i had to be realistic with my lifestyle and decided to return it then and there. if there were two severe snags on two skirts before even leaving the store, how would th
2952	4	a	"I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag, no fit , no drape very unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale, it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep."
2953	3	a	"This jacket doesn't look all that special in the photos provided. i found it at my local store and i knew it was mine the moment i tried it on. it has that boxy shoulder look i associate with 80s power suits. i call this look: ""full sigourney weaver"" and it is marvelous! perfect for a lunch date with harrison ford circa 1988. so happy with this purchase. highly recommend!"
2954	0	a	I ordered these in both the grey and moss, and i love both. they are very soft, very easy, loose fitting casual shorts. i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured, so they hit lower on my leg than on the model, which i prefer in these. i am 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered xs. the dark grey ones feel more versatile, like you could throw on anything with them and go. the moss look cute with white/cream summery tops. they washed well (machine, cold, laid flat to dry), touched up with light steam from
2955	1	a	This dress is absolutely beautiful! and, had it been just a little longer or a little shorter i would have kept it. but, the hem hit me at just the wrong spot! alas, i had to send it back :(
2956	0	a	"I think these jeans are much better in person than on the picture. on the model they look a bit boxy and too loose for my taste. i am tall, slim/athletic and they fit like made for me in my usual size. they have some ""give"" and tend to get looser while you wear them, but because they are midrise they won't slide down. they are a slightly relaxed swlim fit on me. the demin is solid, the color a nice medium dark sky blue. the emobroidery and the beads are beautiful and look like they will hold up"
2957	0	a	These citizens of humanity jeans are indeed pricy but worth the money. they fit slim through the hips and not too loose in the legs to make you feel like they are huge...very versatile and look fabulous with a cropped sweater or even a hip length top. add a pair of chunky shoes and you have a great look. i even tried them with dansko clogs and they looks cute. it's a great break from skinny jeans and much more chic than boyfriend jeans.
2958	4	a	I love this tank. super soft and comfy. i wear with leggings, jeans, shorts- anything. longer in the back so will cover your butt- at least it covered mine. runs slightly oversized. love the asymmetry in the front- very flattering. very happy with it.
2959	4	a	I love this shirt. it would be a fairly basic tee but the neckline makes it fun. it's very soft and comfortable. i bought the white with blue pattern and will probably purchase additional colors.
2960	1	a	"I was looking for a dress that had a lot of color. since i usually stick to neutrals, this was out of my comfort zone, but i found this one and loved it. it's comfortable, not clingy, and i can wear a regular bra (bonus!). i wish the waist wasn't dropped, but i think it worked well. i plan on wearing it more in the spring/summer, dressing it up or down will be easy.   i'm usually a size 12 and this fit true to size."
2961	0	a	"When i opened the package i knew i was in love. the colors are vibrant-true to the photo. the fabric is delicious, soft and silky, the perfect weight for a warm summer day. these can be dressed up or down. i am 5'9"" 140lbs. i bought the medium and they fit with plenty of room.  i would highly reccomend these shorts-just gorgeous! come on summer!"
2962	0	a	This skirt is unique yet versatile and gorgeous. everything about this skirt works: dazzle balanced out with softness and midi length. the twirly width shows off the skirt in a subtle way, and super comfortable. no petite 2 left so i purchased a regular 2 and it fits perfectly (i am 5ft2in, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls about 2in. longer than shown on the model. this skirt is sold out fast, no surprise. it flatters all body types at all ages. get ready for lots of compliments!
2963	4	a	"Spotted this in the local store last week & just had to try it on! it is a soft cotton gauze texture which is slightly stiff but in a good way. my usual size small was too big. the oversized look was fine from front & back view, but in the side view the bottom stuck way out. the xs was much better so i took it home. its very comfy & looks great with dark blue denim. 5'3"", 118#."
2964	3	a	Runs almost two sizes small. i plan to wear as a jacket over a sleeveless dress / skirt / trousers like a suit. the material is sturdy. i recommend for early autumn or spring weather. once again, a collector's item with unique colors and design of pattern.
2965	4	a	This top looks great and feels great. got lots of compliments when i wore it for thanksgiving. i pretty plan to wear this for every holiday event this year and will layer it with sweaters and scarves to mix it up.
2966	4	a	Picked this up at the local retailer in both colors. the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan - which i also bought. highly recommend.
2967	0	a	Overall beautiful skirt, material is a little on the heavy and stiff side but still a really nice skirt
2968	0	a	I love this skirt! as a fan of different textures and pretty things, this piece exceeded my expectations! i am always a size 0 or 2 in retailer dresses and the 2 fits like a glove. the length is perfect - just above the knee. ever since i wore a valentino dress with a similar thick, neoprene material, i've adored the feel of it! everything feels firm and put together. the colors in this skirt are beautiful and the pattern is feminine and romantic. it will pair well with lots of different tops too!
2969	0	a	Love these! so comfy and a great color! also love that it came in petite! it is so hard to find avoid crop pant in petite!!!
2970	4	a	This blouse is sumptuous! the fabric is soooo soft, embroidery beautiful, fit flattering. sadly i returned it due to the color. i mostly shop on-line due to time restriction, and the picture looks to be a winter white to me. it is a light yellow color, most pleasing with the cobalt embroidery. alas, any shade of yellow makes my skin look jaundice - so back it had to go.
2971	2	a	Extremely pretty swimsuit, gorgeous cut in the front with the lace and the floral print, very flattering to hourglass shapes. coverage across rear end is a bit less than i would prefer, but it's so very pretty that i'm keeping it. several comments from friends that this could be worn as a tank top for regular wear it is so pretty.
2972	2	a	I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.
2973	4	a	The sweater is light and very soft. the silver banding on the neck, sleeves and hem make it easy to dress up.
2974	4	a	I bought this stylish and cozy sweater in ivory. i find that cable knit sweaters tend to add bulk, but this sweater creates a long, lean look. it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans, and the buttons on the cowl are a fun detail. every time i wear this, i get compliments on it.
2975	4	a	This top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price. it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it. also, the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt. still, the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans.
2976	4	a	"I bought this tunic today because it paired well with patterned slim pants. at 5'2"" the tunic felt like it added height and even though i'm a 34f the top fit well across the bust. i tried on the large first, and it felt very comfortable but a bit big. the medium fit a little more snugly, but was more proportional in the arms, so i purchased it instead. the neckline is not too low and does not require a camisole under and the buttons add a nice weight so that the top drapes towards my chest inst"
2977	4	a	This is a beautiful top, however it looks better on the 80 pound model. the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body. if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are.
2978	1	a	"I originally bought the white lace version of this dress, but it felt too ""bridey?"" then i snagged all three of the velvet blazers and spotted this black version. i like that it is not all lace, with the pleated chiffon ""center."" the under slip is straight and fits with the outer layer sheer enough to give the appearance of there being a shape under the flow. it is so versatile as i can do it with the velvet blazers and booties or classic lbd with black pumps. well worth the price as this will f"
2979	4	a	I really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy. it's shorter in the front and longer in the back. the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled. it's definitely worth trying on, but didn't fit me.
2980	4	a	I first saw this shirt on one of the workers at the retailer stores and it looked beautiful. i loved it so much i had to order it when it came on sale. the fit is a little too short for my liking, but i think i can make it work. also, it does fit a little snug around the arms but it at least it doesn't show your undergarments. overall, i think it is absolutely beautiful. the fabric has a beautiful shimmer to it and it looks easy to dress up for a day at the office or a night on the town, or paired
2981	0	a	Fit true to size and very well. hit the leg at a good length. i'm 5'5. they were perfect.
2982	0	a	"I'm 5'5"" 120 lbs and i bought these in a 0. they fit great. i wore them for upwards of 12 hours and i was very comfortable. i received compliments on the print and cut. very flattering."
2983	4	a	Perfect fit. though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami. i absolutely recommend this shirt. it fits tts.
2984	1	a	Love everything about this: the length, cut, look, etc. i wear medium/large... went with medium and it was perfect.
2985	0	a	The nolan's are my favorite pair of jeans from any brand. they are skinny leg but not too tight and the material is oh so soft. i buy 1-2 sizes down as they stretch out a lot.
2986	1	a	I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline, so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale, but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves. they were right! the way it's seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that it's incredibly flattering. the fabric is light enough for warm weather, though it may be too heavy for hot weather. it's soft and has a very flattering n
2987	4	a	I know a lot of folks thought this top was too big/boxy, but i'm pretty slim up top with a big booty (quintessential pear shape), and i think the shape is totally flattering. your mileage may vary, but with free returns i'd just try it on first.  i sized down one size, which helped, and got the raspberry  colored one. i adore the color -- it's impossibly vibrant, and beautiful for spring summer or fall. the eyelets don't have any cloth underneath, just bare skin,  but they're so small that i don
2988	4	a	I cant say enough about this top. the material is soft and comfy . very well made. the length and  size is spot on! looks great tucked in or out! very versatile. highly recommend!!
2989	4	a	It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. wouldn't recommend. though it is sooooo soft!
2990	1	a	"It has been a long cold winter and spring...but it is going to get hot! and this is a perfect dress for july. i tried this on and did not feel the need for a slip or a cami, yes, it is lightweight, no, i would not consider it for work, but when it gets hot in the summer, i feel like this will be a perfect slip on and go dress for days or casual evenings. i wear a 12, and the medium fit perfectly i considered ordering the small, since i had some extra space, but again, it is going to get hot,"
2991	1	a	"I searched far and wide for this dress. after ordering an 8, 10 and 12 from 3 different stores in two different cities, in a span of 2 months, i finally settled on the 10! i literally went searching for this while on vacation, too. i'm 5'5.5"", 160 lbs and 36c bust and the 10 fit perfectly. this dress is adorable and i've worn it to the office and on the weekends. this will definitely be in my biweekly rotation this summer. the quality is on point and it was definitely worth the price tag. i was"
2992	3	a	This great weekend staple is the perfect lightweight jacket. it has a roomy, comfortable fit but the drawstring helps you create a bit of a waist. got lots of compliments on the embroidery.
2993	4	a	Just got the small peach in the mail; love it. also got the black small petite; works great as this shirt is pretty long. great boho tee.
2994	1	a	I know this is supposed to be a loose, flowy fit which is exactly the style i love. however, this is beyond tent-like. i'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small. fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper. huge bummer, especially after seeing a few 5-stars.
2995	4	a	"I tried the 4 and felt it ran a bit big, i'm 34a-28-26, 5'6"" about 130lbs and expected to take a 6. the 4 was ideal. love the concept but thought the material was too stiff to be a 'swing' tank. the pleats in the back poke up when you move or bend as if you've got little horns coming out of your back. i think a chambray, like cloth and stone produces might have rendered this super cute design better (imo). it has a trapeze shape, i wouldn't plan on tucking it in. finally, you mightn't want to"
2996	1	a	I have a different perspective than the other reviewers. the fabric is thin - and silky -perfect for summer! it is a pleasant change from other items in my summer closet. i bought the small, which i typically wear. it can easily be dressed up with heels and down with flat sandals. finally, it has pockets!!!!
2997	0	a	I love this skirt! i know others have thought it frumpy, maybe it's because i'm so long waisted but this skirt is perfect for me! not too long not too short but just right! the fabric print is beautiful a mix of muted and bright colors. the fabric quality is nice but nothing overly outstanding. still i'm glad i ordered it before it was gone!
2998	0	a	These cords are great, the fit, the style, everything! my new favorite fall pants!
2999	4	a	"I bought this in the white in both the sp and the mp. i am 5'2"". i ended up keeping the mp (my usually size at 36c, broad shoulders). i found that the top of the sleeves to be a bit snug and i have normal size arms. if you look at the model shots, you can see that they are tight on top. i also found this shirt to be very long, even in the petite sizing. overall, i kept it as it was slimming, quality made, and the tight sleeve hopefully won't bother me (or shrink!)"
