10001	Citizens of humanity jeans are excellent!!! i prefer high rise & this brand is my favorite. i like the clean lines & plain design. the material is comfortable- substantial with just enough stretch in the material which makes them super comfortable. i'm not constantly pulling these jeans up, they hold their shape really well & wash well too. they run tts.
10002	Could not wait to try this on when it arrived, jumpers are tricky in the way they can ride up and become unflattering. not the case here, i usually wear a size 8 but i decided to order a size down for a size 6. i am 5'5 and 150 lb. being the fact that i am in the midst of losing weight i thought i would rather it be more snug and this really was just right. the pockets make it casual and cute, while the print and bare shoulder make it fresh and chic. you will love!
10003	This is a charming dress, with lots of quality touches, and something which is easy to wear and appropriate for many occasions. however, the dress i received wasn't quite like the dress pictured in the catalog and main website photos. the bottom buttons of the over-dress do not have matching holes, so you can't button it. this makes the v lower, and the bodice looser. it is like the photo with the brunette model on the website, rather than the primary photos with the blonde lady. personally, i w
10004	There aren't enough great words to describe this dress. tried on the black one in store yesterday and knew immediately i was going to purchase.  everything is perfection - not tight slip underneath that even has the strap snap closures to hold it in place at the shoulders, not too low cut, hits right above knee so not too short, light weight, flattering, etc!!  and machine washable! can dress up or down. could even wear to work with a jacket or cardi. can wear all seasons - can't wait to pair wi
10005	Great pop of color (i purchased the rosy color) and great piece you can add layers to. it drapes beautifully, may run a tad larger, but not enough to size down. light weight, so wear alone for warmer fall days or as we get into spring, and with a scarf and jacket for cooler days.
10006	I really wanted to love this dress! the quality is great, and the overall look is so lovely. however, i tried two different sizes (petite s and petite xs) and it still looked too baggy/big. the upper part is wider than it appears. also, the photos shows the bottom two buttons buttoned up. however, the dress doesn't actually have any loop holes or button holes, so it just hangs open. very sad to have to return both dresses.
10007	I purchased the mauve dress from an retailer store last weekend during their 20% off sale. i absolutely can not say enough great things about this dress. it fits beautifully... the pattern on the material is so pretty and feminine. once i got home from the store and tried the dress on again, i immediately purchased the black one also. i had to have it in black too! such a great dress to wear to parties, date night, friends outings.. we are going to california in september and will be wearing these
10008	It lays very nicely on your body. very flattering!!!!
10009	This is a great dress from moving to summer into fall. it's great right now with the warm temps, but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit. it's very comfortable also. there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front. i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through. maybe, you can adjust it at the straps some. at any rate, it's a nice dress and i'm keeping it.
10010	Just as the others have reviewed, i agree! this dress is flowy and so feminine. i got it today and i am wearing it now! so light! i usually wear a large or a 12 in dresses. i am pear shaped. 36b bust and large hips. it is flattering and feels great on. the slip underneath fits perfect on me. grab this before it becomes iso!
10011	I caught a sneak peak of this beautiful dress on a local retailer instagram page...and i was so excited when it arrived at my store. i love this dress! i went with the black because i loved how bold it was. it's ultra feminine and flowy. the slip underneath has the prettiest embroidered print and the overlay is light and airy. the bottom is hemmed with a little lace peekaboo and it is wonderful. i tried this on in both a l and an xl. the xl fit well but the dress was a little long on top, so i wen
10012	"The print, layers and fit of this dress remind me of the 1990's but in a good way! the outer dress is voluminous and flowy, so i understand why some reviewers feel the dress runs large. the embroidered slip is tts and quite the cherry on top. i really appreciate that styling detail. 140# 36dd 5'3"" and i chose medium regular length, not petite since i'm older and wanted the length."
10013	Thin for this late in the season, but the colors are so pretty. i'm going to layer it over a long sleeve t, top with a cardi and pair with leggings. runs large. love the the unconnected slip. 5 stars.
10014	Got this dress in the mail today, and it's definitely a keeper. the material is high quality, and i can see wearing this dress on all but the coldest days of winter. it'll be great to wear today in 90 degree weather, and with a cardigan and booties, it will easily transition into cool weather. the colors, patterns, and lace are all just beautiful. for reference, i always order xs for loose fitting dresses, and a size 4 for close fitting styles. the xs in this dress is perfect.
10015	"Love this dress! it's a little roomy on me & i maybe should have gone with the medium. i'm 5'11"" and about 165 so usually wear a large. my problem is with the length. i knew it was a gamble, but the other color images on the 5'10"" model gave me the hope that the dress would come close to being near my knees ... nope. it's a good 6"" above them, and i couldn't wear this to work. so being the crafty sort, i'm pondering adding a few more lace layers to the hem."
10016	I started buying maeve dresses about five years ago and love every last one that i own! this one is no exception. i bought it in black last week (size s) for my birthday treat, and it was so wonderfully light during the week of 99 f heat in the district. it's feminine and delicate in appearance, yet the material is of good quality and super comfortable. it's awesome, just a perfect summer and probably fall dress.
10017	"I love the look of this dress. the fitting could use some work--the top layer could be slightly more fitted--but overall it looks adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned the top does not have any button loops.   my biggest issue with the dress is the quality of the material. one time through the wash on the gentle cycle and the slip underneath has shrunk at least a full size. for the price of this dress, i don't expect disposable clothing. if i had known it would shrink, i would've hand wa"
10018	I must be the lone dissenter, but i am in love with this piece! a dark cami underneath really make the eyelet pop. i probably would not have liked it if it did not have the clasp, as it does run wide. however, with skinny jeans or slim pants, this works b/c it's loose in the right ways. it may not be for everyone, but it's one of my faves right now.
10019	The essence of femininity. simply beautiful. if you begin with the pattern of the dress, you become drawn to it. then, as you look closer and see the slip with its creamy detailed embroidery, and immediately you see how the dress opens at the bodice with tiny, set buttons, you soon realize, that's not all... the bottom of this fine piece of art continues with soft, delicate, chiffon trim with a bonus layer of the most beautiful lace to finish it off. i bought it on sight and just love it. i was
10020	This is a must have for summer. i'm always hot but sometimes a sweater just doesn't look right. the short sleeves are just what i've been looking for. every jacket i own runs smaller on me around the bust and arms, so i think for everyone else, your normal jacket size should be perfect.
10021	I bought these pants to wear while riding on the back of my husbands motorcycle. i wanted something that was more chic than typical motorcycle women's clothing and these were perfect. they block the wind but are stretchy on the back side so they are super comfortable to wear all day. i also wear these to work on fridays! i bought a size 28 and they fit great. i usually wear a 6 in us sizing.
10022	"Great dress, can be styled up or down for more casual look. it ran a bit large for me, especially up top; the armholes were droopy unfortunately. i ordered the s but returned, the xs will hopefully be better. for reference, i'm usually a s, 5'5"" 127lb."
10023	I ordered this dress in two colors and i'm happy that i did!  very cute and great fit!  flattering too!
10024	Love this top for work. loose, flattering and enough detail to be noticed. fits tts and goes with everything.
10025	"Bought this in the white in the store - came home and ordered the blue - wish they had my size in the orange. maybe this is enough said? this is so comfortable, so well made, so easy to wear - might be the perfect dress ever."
10026	I typically wear a 4 in dresses, and sized up to a 6 because of the other reviews. i'm bigger on bottom than on top, and the 6 fit me fine (snug, but fine) on the bottom but the top was a bit big. there was too much material in the arm hole area. it's very pretty and good quality, but not a good fit for pear-shapes.
10027	They are beautiful in person, until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist, roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather, especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams, is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.
10028	I am a huge fan of pilcro pants, and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants. the idea is great - leather in the front, fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look. however, i couldn't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around (can't bend the leg all the way; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee). the fit was perfect everywhere else. sadly, these had to go back :(
10029	I liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy. fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me. may look better on a different body type.
10030	Absolutely love this dress!! this was my first purchase from this site and as per the usual, i was worried about the sizing but the fit couldn't be better. definitely won't be the last. material is heavenly and has a double layering that was a nice surprise. very warm and soft. high quality stuff. i could have gotten my usual size in petite, but i didn't want it to be too short. i'm glad i did. this is the perfect dress for work.
10031	This dress is everything i hoped it would be. it is soft and comfortable, and flattering even though it's not tight fitting. true to size as well.
10032	They are beautiful! they fit amazingly! they ripped on a seam the third time i wore them. i kept wearing them, because again, the fit! the style! alas, about the fifth time i wore them, the other leg ripped at the knee seam. they are just totally falling apart. it's so very sad. i would wear them alllll the time if they could bear it. i'm actually thinking of buying another pair because i love them soooo, but it would likely be wasted cash as i believe there is a real manufacturing issue here. w
10033	I initially walked right by these pants when i saw them on the rack. then i saw them on the fitting room attendant. they looked amazing . i ended up purchasing them and i love them . the great thing about them is the the leather is only in the front which makes it great for moving around and sitting down (the back is kinda legging like). i had to size down in these.
10034	I really wanted to like these, but they just didn't look right on my 5'3 sorta bulky frame. i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings, so maybe i'm just not the right target for these, but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try. the waist was too high for my liking, and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look.
10035	"I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh. this top is just reall"
10036	I am sadly returning this dress, but i would recommend it! it is soft and i loved the design of the dress. very comfortable. the only reason i am returning it is due to my figure. it is a fitted dress and was a little more revealing that i would have liked.
10037	"I think this is a really flattering dress. i like the length of the sleeves (they're not long like in retailer's very first navy photo but all the other pics are accurate in my opinion.) in my photo, i'm wearing an xs regular so i'd say it's shorter than 35"" because i'm only 5'3"" and it's above my knee. it may run slightly small because i'm a 34aa, with a 26"" waist, 34"" hips and usually wear xspetite in retailer but this xs fits me fine (although to get it to be fitted at the waist, xxs might be bet"
10038	I absolutely love the look and fit of these pants. what is even better is that they don't stretch out while wearing them. i will get a lot of use out of them!
10039	Such a pretty dress and the colors are just so summery. it's very flattering on but i will have to return it unfortunately. i ordered the 6p because the 8p was sold out and although the top fits quite well, its just too snug on the hips. if the 8p was available i would definitely exchange it for that.
10040	
10041	I tried it on and it fit like a glove. it was a little strange having a different fabric on the back, but it worked and i am keeping it.
10042	These are such a great alternative to actual leather pants, they have the perfect amount of stretch and breath-ability (i've always found leather pants to be too hot) . got the holly color, unfortunately the p size was sold out but as another reviewer noted, these are easy to roll up. i noticed some of the complaints about quality and these not holding up, but given the use of two different materials, pu and a stretchy material, i think it's only natural that these would tear along the seams aft
10043	Love the versatility of the dress. very easy to dress either up or down. i've been able to wear it out for a casual day with a denim jacket and booties (just like the stock photo!) or even wear it to work with a black jacket and flats. the color is beautiful and the material is very soft and comfortable. absolutely love the cut and design of the dress on top. only thing i would mention is that the dress is a bit form fitting than expected. it definitely hugs your curves.
10044	Absolutely love these pants! i have had these pilcos for about two months now and it has been a staple in my fall wardrobe. i have worn them at least once a week. the only downfall is the button has already fallen off and the seam in the knee has recently torn apart. given the leather, i'm not sure if they can be fixed. these are fabulous, but the quality is just not there. very disappointing.
10045	I bought this dress for a dinner after my daughter's wedding rehearsal. it is perfect. it is dressy enough for the occasion. it also has a casual look to it. i think it is very versatile. i fell in love with the colors, material and the quality. i am more excited about this dress then the dress i am wearing to the wedding. buy it you'll love it.
10046	
10047	
10048	"I really liked this dress when i tried the navy on in the store. i am 5'4"", 140 lb. and the medium fit me really well. unfortunately, i am not comfortable showing a lot of leg so the dress was just too short for me. if it had come to the tops of my knees i would have gone for it but it was well above my knees. the fit and color were great though, i loved the neckline and the material was very soft and comfortable. i tried the large but, while it was a little longer, the larger size made it lose"
10049	"I'm so happy i decided to order this dress! i am 5'3"" 120 lbs and normally buy xs petite, but the comments said the dress is a little short so i went with a xs regular in navy. i am glad i did -- it hits me about 2-3 inches above the knee. the material is very soft and seems well constructed. a bit thicker than your average summer dress but i like that! very flattering overall, and for the price it's a great steal!"
10050	
10051	As a tall girl, i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs! they are amazing for dressing up (or sassing up) and outfit. i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them. however, as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor. after wearing them to they symphony, the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat! i really don't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved. i'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants!
10052	"As you can tell from the pictures, it's nothing fancy; i think this dress will get a lot of wear for everyday living. simple and comfy. reviewers said it ran pretty small so i sized up but wished i hadn't. it is not very ""fit"
10053	"I bought this dress in ivory and then bought the navy on sale, i loved it so much. i'm 5'4"", 117, and the petite medium was perfect. love the kicky flare, and the lining makes it so comfortable. an effortless, fun dress - perfect for hot summer lunch."
10054	They are very comfortable and have kept their shape after a couple of wearings. the pants can be used for informal or on the dressier side. the spandex in them is contributes to the comfort.
10055	"I bought the navy color in xs petite. i'm 5'1, 115 w/ athletic build. i thought the fit was perfectly fine. with a belt, the dress is about 3 inches above my knee. the dress is made very soft/breathable fabric and has a ""slip"" underneath.  bonus: the dress is made in the usa! i'll be buying the white and red once they're marked down a bit more. very satisfied with this dress."
10056	I purchased the navy size small and was delighted with the fit. the waist line is perfectly proportioned for a petite. i think this means that the waist line will be high on a woman who needs regular sizing. i like the lining, it adds a substantial look to the dress.
10057	I loved these pants the minute i put them on, and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends, not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this, because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears, then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom
10058	Very beautiful sheath dress that will be perfect for summer weddings and spring events because of the delicious sorbet pallette.  it's a substantial weight fabric that will nip you in and give the illusion of curves where none exist (in a good way.).  pattern is actually knit into the fabric not printed.  size 8p is the smaller of my size range so for others who are slender on top may want to size down.  if you have prominent hips, stay tts or size up.  if you are very busty, it's tts or size up
10059	I love these pants. i have them in the black and green. they are comfortable and look great on my curvy figure. i am 5'2 120lbs and got the size 27
10060	Fits true to size with good coverage. stayed put when i was in the pool.
10061	"I said this ran large because i bought a 16 and i normally need a size 18 (i'm busty) if the item doesn't stretch. but, a size 16 fit me. it's more straight and less blousy, but it does fit. so, if you like your tops a little less full of fabric and more tailored but loose, imho you can size down.  the fabric is rayon/polyester that's light and cool. it is semi-sheer but a white bra or nude bra would be fine. the top has a double layer in front. one solid and the over-lay of the embroidery. th"
10062	I bought this today in navy and loved it the second i put it on. it feels great on, is well made and flattering! you can wear it anywhere and look pulled together. much cuter in real life too. it does run a little small. id go up a size if you're getting the white so it won't cling too much.
10063	Received these in the green holly color (beautiful color) for christmas
10064	"I bought the navy version of this dress in the store and thought it looked pretty nice. i am 5'10"" and 145 pounds, and the small fit me great. i think that the dress looks exactly like it does in the pictures, at least for the particular color that i bought; the length comes about mid-thigh, as shown, and i would definitely have worn it to work. after looking in the mirror for a few more days though, i decided to return the dress, because i didn't feel like the shape of it was especially sensati"
10065	I have thicker thighs and don't usually find that i can wear this kind of thing. these, on the other hand, are hot, hot, hot and are even somehow slimming for my thighs. i just adore them. i'm waiting for the green color to go on sale so i can buy them too!
10066	Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!
10067	I'm 5 feet 120 and hourglass figure. i literally burst out laughing when i opened the package. i ordered my usual small petite. the dress is so short and small you would have to be 4 feet 90 pounds. returning.
10068	I have this top in 3 colors and am waiting for the black to arrive. very soft on the body. we live in fl so lightweight is appreciated. stylish fit that is not ordinary. great colors. will pack well and can be dressed up with a scarf. sleeves run long.
10069	So i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down. the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made. i really wish this were just lined dress. i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath. not worth the money, but i needed something to wear that was transitional.
10070	
10071	Love this top! i bought it in 2 colors; it's a great twist on a basic tee. love love love!
10072	"I am 5'0"", 109lbs, 32d, and the 0 petite fit tts. the fabric is comfortable and the dress well made. my only complaint would be that the picture of the model and the dress i have in my possession do not have the same coloured slip. my dress arrived with a nude slip. i was a little confused at first but when i tried on the dress i realized it was not a bad thing. the lace actually stands out. all in all, a greal buy. discounts make it worth it too."
10073	These jeans look amazing on! hug every curve in just the right way....the long length with flare...add a platform heel and i look like i have legs for days!! and my booty will definitely turn some heads! total splurge but for a great pair of jeans, totally worth it. ordered my usual size 27 and they fit like a dream. hope they don't stretch out after wearing a few hours. the amount of stretch feels nice, so i think they'll continue to hug your body. if you want 1 pair of flares in your wardrobe.
10074	I love the crisscross detail that makes this a stylish and also flattering piece. lovely soft material that drapes well and hides imperfections. wish it came in more colors!
10075	I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail, i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online, the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat, i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!
10076	I have a few of these tees in the short sleeve version and found myself wearing them pretty often so i jumped on the long sleeve option when it went on sale. i bought the black and red (which is more of an orangey red). i love them as well! this top drapes nicely and has a little more style than just a plain tee. the material is thin and while that is nice for breeziness sake, i don't anticipate this will last that long, but thats cool...its not a real investment piece but rather a cute casual t
10077	This is the perfect tank. it's super soft, great colors and with a shape that allows you to wear a regular bra. best of all, it was offered in petitie sizes. for me that means i finally have a tank that doesn't gap at the arms or scoop too low or flood me with excess length. thank you retailer for remembering us petitie girls with this wonderful tank!
10078	These tanks are very soft. i have two black and one coral. i had to return the white as it was see through. they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if you're in between sizes. i recommend these tanks for sure
10079	Love the cut of this t-shirt. just loose enough but not big and boxy like so many other tees but not fitted either. nice weight, the hemline is interesting...overall happy with it. just hope it doesn't shrink!
10080	"I was surprised to find this jacket on sale and i don't mind :) it's a trend of the season and i absolutely don't mind to look like a mattress or wear robe. the garment runs large so i wear usually 6 and have to get xs. i am 5'6"" 146 lbs usually wear s/m in jackets. it hits me 2 inches below my knee. i love it."
10081	"But when i saw this top in person, urged by my stylist when they got it in, i decided to try it on. they had xs in store, my former normal size (xs or xsp). that was too big though. not being sure how the petite would look, and not sure if smaller would work, i decided to order all three: xxs, xsp and xxsp!  verdict on size: xxsp was pulling at the arm holes, kind of small there. xxs regular was almost right, but arm holes were a little high, not as comfortable. xsp ended up being the right c"
10082	I loved this dress and ordered it online. i found the colors to be a bit more muted than i expected, and unfortunately the fabric quality seemed low considering the price point. ultimately i decided to return it as i couldn't justify spending $178 on a dress that didn't seem as well made as i would expect from retailer.
10083	I ordered this style in the blue, red, yellow and white for the sale price. they all fit true to size, matching the model's photos. but, the quality is poor. the hems are frayed, they wrinkle easily, they're just a mess. the model's photos show a messy look so you know what you're getting. the positives are the colors. the blue is especially gorgeous. the yellow is like a spicy mustard shade. they are all comfortable. just sloppy looking. the sale price matches the quality. they do stretch out t
10084	"Beautiful spring dress. perfect for luncheons or any occasion. so very pretty, lovely fabric and good fit. you will definitely feel pretty in this dress. y daughter is 5'3"" and the length was perfect."
10085	
10086	
10087	I wanted to like this top, especially because of its comfortable material and color, but the asymmetrical shape didn't hang well on me. it also runs big - i got a small, and although the bodice fit okay, the sleeves were long, and the bottom of the top looked mishaped and dumpy. this top will be going back.
10088	"Though i am a true size medium, i do not like fitted tees, so generally i buy a large. based upon other reviews, i decided to give the medium a try, hoping that it would be loose enough. though i am on the cusp of petite (5' 3 1/2""), i decided to go with the regular medium since i prefer longer, tunic length tops. the medium does run big, imo, and fits me like a large would. it is loose, flowy and long enough to cover my entire backside. the sleeves are long and i do have to roll them up, perhap"
10089	"First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5"" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t"
10090	"I never write reviews, but i just purchased this top at full price last week in the store. it's not a have to have top just to look at it, but once i put it on i had to have it. it's extremely comfortable and i am able to wear it while running around with my boys and still feel as though i'm put together.   i've worn this top now 2 times and after the 2nd wear i have 3 holes in the area where the waist line of my jeans sits. the first time i wore this top it was for only and hour or so. what a"
10091	"I ordered the tangerine color of this tank. it's a great color, slightly heathered.  what i like most about this tank are the riders straps and the depth of the scoop neck. it allows for a normal bra and could be dressed up or down.  i wore the tank out and about, and it was comfy and pretty. later, though, my husband came home and asked if i knew it was see through. eek! sure enough, it is pretty sheer in certain lights. next time, i will wear a cami underneath. though i wish it were a bit"
10092	This dress is gorgeous. the quality is high, runs true to size, and is very flattering! my only issue is the tule. i already have hips, so the tule makes the dress over-flare. i am going to have the tailor remove the tule and it will be perfect. for those who are not an hourglass shape naturally, this will help provide the extra shaping.  overall, i love this dress and will be keeping it.
10093	"These shirts are fantastic; lightweight sleeves for summer wear. i go back and forth between xs and small, (i have broad shoulders) and ordered one of each. i like both. the shirt has give so the xs is fine but the variation in size gives the two shirts very different looks.  the color is fantastic and true to the photos! not always the case with online purchasing so i loved that."
10094	I ordered a regular size 6 because the petite size 6 was sold out. it was too large for me; maybe the 4 would have worked. in part because the size was off, it looked frumpy on me with the poofs and flowers. however, i did like that it is cotton and has its own beige-colored slip that snaps on at the shoulders. i have no doubt this could look very nice on someone if the size was just right.. i like the black crochet-type details.
10095	Really cute sweater, well made, but so intensely itchy i couldn't keep it on for more than 30 seconds !
10096	I was really excited about this dress- the style looked like it would be a spring/summer staple in my retailer-heavy wardrobe. i was really surprised when i received it in the mail. the dress is quite thin cotton fabric and feels cheaply made. for the price, i could purchase a much higher quality dress elsewhere that would hold up better. i've been an retailer fan for more than an decade, but this trend of higher prices for lower quality is disappointing and insirpring me to leave a review for the f
10097	Great, comfy shirt! long enough that i can wear it with leggings!
10098	Should have listened 2 a previous review! while this is a very well made garment, it really does remind me of a bathrobe, and will be returning :( too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great. also...this runs very large. the extra small was more like a medium.
10099	This shirt is such a beautiful color! the lavender is a really lovely addition to spring wardrobe and goes with more than imagined. it has a bit of an oversized fit although it falls really nicely on slimmer silhouettes. it's also incredibly comfy and stylish with an updated look even to the most casual of attire.
10100	I received this top yesterday and love it! sexy yet not too revealing and great for date night! i like the way it fits across the chest and isn't too short in the waist. very soft fabric.
10101	I was looking for a classic, white t-shirt that wasn't too big (i.e. a tunic) or too fitted. this was perfect! i love the irregular hemline and the fit. it's not too tight, but not too big either where it looks messy. just a perfect little tee for any wardrobe. runs true to size. i'm a 34d, size 10 and ordered the medium - it fit great!
10102	I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it.
10103	Got this in the pretty springy blue already wore it with white jeans and loved it!! love the loose longer swingy style and i can't wait to wear again! i may have to get another color!
10104	I own this tank in three different colors, and have been wearing them since the weather warmed up! they are soft, good quality, and wash up well. i've taken them on vacation as they take up no room in my suitcase, and also have used them as little camisole shirts. they don't fit too tight on, just right. i think you could also use them with pajama bottoms to sleep in.
10105	"I was looking for a tee that i could wear on the weekends without looking sloppy and also have a little coverage for when i'm feeling a little bloated. (come on, that's what happens sometimes on weekends, ha!) this tee is great because it's got some coverage and it's also not sloppy looking or oversized while still being flowy and flattering.   the shoulders and arms are fairly tts and there's a slight a-line shape to this tee, so its flattering without being a tent or frumpy looking. i did si"
10106	"This jacket is beautiful. the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect. however, one i put it on, i couldn't wait to get it off. it's so itchy!! i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable. especially around my neck. i wouldn't recommend this jacket based on the material alone. also, the jacket runs large. i'm 5'1"" 130 lbs 34d and i ordered the small. i would definitely size down."
10107	I loved the fact that this dress is cotton. it is a thin cotton, and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap. mine came with a nude slip. i'm thinking they all come with a nude slip. i'm not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is. the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine won't tear easily or to retur
10108	Adorable summer top. the geometrical shape makes this top interesting. it looks much better on then in the picture displayed. it's soft , flowing and covers all flaws. the gold color is beautiful and vibrant. i know i will purchase this in other colors. the long back really sets it off. if you are looking for comfort, don't hesitate, this top is perfect.
10109	Very pretty top. runs a bit large (i generally take an xs and the xs in this top fits me a little longer and larger than on the model). comfortable and easy to wear. nice cut with angled front and bit longer back. did develop a small hole very quickly as some thinner and tissue tees do but hoping that's unusual as i did buy two different colors of this tee shirt and will be totally disappointed if this happens to both, especially at this price.
10110	When i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe. straight, too boxy.
10111	This top is semi fitted and then stretches as you wear it. i love the design and color choices.
10112	Loved this skirt. it reminded me of the styles that i saw visiting paris this past summer.
10113	This tee is so comfortable and stylish. you can easily dress it up. i love how the back covers your assets, and the sleeves are long enough for tall girls. a great buy on sale! i bought a small and bought 3 colors!
10114	Bought these jeans after reading others reviews and was not disapointed. these are the most flatering jeans! they give you legs for days, while providing amazing shape. oh and did i mention their soft as butter. huge win for me as jeans are one of the most difficult items for me to my as my waist is 1-2 sized smaller than my hips and thes stretch marvilously to fit your body. they are on the pricier side and well worth it.
10115	Great with leggings and skinny jeans! it's comfortable too!
10116	This vest is cute. the colors are as pictured, and the lace detail on the back is adorable. it is summery and versatile. however, it was really big on me. i usually wear and xs, but it just swallowed me. now i have to consider whether to exchange for an xs petite.
10117	I like this top. in the photo, the white in the print stands out. in-person, the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull, more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good, the print looks good. it is a swing top, looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down, could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.
10118	Beautiful color, design and fit.  but i couldn't wait to get it off.  i don't have sensitive skin and don't recall ever putting a jacket on that felt like steel wool.
10119	"This dress is more lovely in person than in the picture. the lace details show beautifully against its nude slip. i'm 5'1"" 130# and regular size 2 fits perfectly and hits at my knees. it's a very flattering dressy-casual dress. it's a bit pricey for a cotton dress but worth it at the 20% retailer promo."
10120	Fantastic quality. i agree the material is heavier and may be too hot for summer in sc but will be perfect for ac cooled offices. the fit is tts. i am smaller on top than the bottom and size 2 fit well everywhere thanks to the somewhat stretchy material, 32-24-36. i never write reviews but this dress really is fantastic and at a great price point given the high quality of the fabric and design. i couldn't tell from the pics but the back bottom is not a single center slit but a double slit. i rea
10121	I saw this in the store and purchased it right on the spot (didn't even see the reviews until now). i can wear either a small or x-small in retailer but for this top, the x-small was a better fit as it draped nicely and was still very loose on me (i'm 5'4, 125 lbs, 34b). i was worried that the opening was too wide but it was perfect. i like the elbow length sleeves and the fact that the blouse is lined which mean it's not sheer and don't have to wear a camisole. i usually stick with the classics i
10122	This shirt is actually not as fitted as it looks on the model. the shirt actually flares out a bit and giving more room to large chested women, like myself. the arms and chest area are a tat small, but the non-fitted style accommodated that nicely. great color, great design with the butterflies and easy to wash. looks great with skinny bell bottoms or even jean shorts in the summer and some cowboy boots. very sexy.
10123	Most peasant tops have a lot of detail at the chest, such as gathering, yoke inlay, ties etc. i like this peasant blouse because it has a simple top part, so it does not add volume to the chest. good for busty figures. pretty top, though colors a bit more autumnal than pictured.
10124	This was really big on me. i am usually a 10 and even the 8 wouldn't stay up around the chest. i would need to have straps sewn on to make this work. on the plus side, the material is absolutely gorgeous. rich, saturated color. too bad about the fit. maybe really busty girls will have better luck, but this is going back. too expensive to justify keeping it if i need to spend money having it remade/tailored.
10125	This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.
10126	I wanted to love this shirt. it's not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just wasn't flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn't right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.
10127	Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas, so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect, since the colors aren't look too summery, but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy, but drapes nicely so it won't make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops, this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.
10128	Love this top for casual days. fits perfectly, fabric feels quality and color is bright but not too bright. good length, just touches top of my thighs.
10129	I saw this blouse in the store a few weeks ago and thought it was really pretty- great colors and fun beading around the wrists & hem. went online to order the petite size and when it arrived i literally couldn't believe it was the same shirt! it was so washed out compared to the one in the store and the petite size is very short (and i'm only 5 feet tall so that's saying something!). the neckline is very wide and open- not even sure what kind of bra wouldn't show?? sadly i wasted the shipping c
10130	I absolutely love this top, it washed up nicely and is perfect for body style. short waist nice soft colors. i ordered another top that is this style. perfect first time i wore it i received so many compliments.
10131	I love this shirt's color which is a lovely yellow. the fit is nice and flowing. i usually wear xs but intentionally bought s, so that it would be a little lose and i may wear with leggings. my one issue is how transparent it is. i opt to wear a spaghetti strap underneath it, however some women might be ok wearing it alone.
10132	I fell in love with this blouse the minute i saw it in the store. the colors are a little deeper than how they appear in the catalog, but the greens and browns are beautiful and will be great for fall! it fit very true to size, i usually wear 8-10, and the m fit perfect. the gold beading on the sleeves and neck are a nice extra! love this top!!
10133	I got these on sale mid-summer at retailer and they quickly became my go-to summer slacks for the office. i work in washington dc and jerusalem -- two really hot cities -- and these are comfortable yet professional. with a sleeveless blouse, jacket and heeled sandals they are professional, with flat sandals and a t-shirt perfect for a weekend. they travel quite well and don't instantly wrinkle the way most linen slacks do. think ahead to next summer and grab them.
10134	"These pants fit me perfectly..i am 5'7"" and 134 (most days).. and wore a 4..they are so comfortable, i could sleep in them. they do stretch a little after wearing (linen), which can be a good thing to some...they are a heavier linen so good for mild winters..almost look denim..if they came in more colors i would get more!they also remind me of my old hippie days, which was fun"
10135	Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.
10136	"I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on, i promptly went online and ordered two more! i've gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them. great for looking put together with no fuss.  people that have commented there's were destroyed in the wash didn't read the care label which says dry clean."
10137	I loved this top... the color is true to screen. the cut is cute. it's a lovely basic top that has just the right twist to it. i loved the fabric. it is see-through but if you wear a nude colored bra under it nothing shows.
10138	I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors, really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t
10139	This is such a beautiful shirt! for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34b) it is a very detailed and tailored shirt so i can understand if your busty why you may have to size up. the attention to detail along with the embroidered butterflies sets this shirt a step above average. the color is an odd shade of olive but i like it and the butterflies have areas that you can see through but not in an im-modest way. i do not feel the need to wear anything under it.
10140	"This picture does not do this skirt justice. it is gorgeous. however, the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device. unfortunately, it was the largest size so i can't size up. i'm 4'11"" so the length was perfect - it came to right above my knees. i love the skirt so much that i'm considering liposuction."
10141	I ordered this in the darker color. i was excited to try it on when it arrived the fabric was really nice, good quality and the design is so cute. sadly it did not work for me. there is a lot of volume especially in the back which does not work for my curvy shape. i can see this top working well on a straighter figure but the volume and length really just did not flatter my hips and thighs. i will be sending this back.
10142	"I like what they were going for here, and the fabric. but it falls short in that i can't wear it to work---the back ""keyhole"" is massive so i can't wear my normal bras, and the very wide neck also shows bra straps, so unless i want to go with a strapless bra, it's not useful for me. i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that. i'd go without, but that is a no-no where i work. i may try getting a size smaller. i wear a med. and i got a small and mayb"
10143	Fits really nicely and i'm picky about sleeves but these are just right. a little see through but i don't have to wear anything under it because the seams and piecing cover well. love the fit not too blousy in the waist and the assymetrical hem is nice.
10144	Would not have picked this out online, but it caught my eye in the store. the blue color is gorgeous, it's a flattering style that drapes well and will pair with just about any short, jean, capri or summer weight pant and a number of chic accessories. you will not be disappointed!
10145	This top is much stiffer, more baby-doll and boxier than pictured. lining is stiff too, and colors more muddy than shown. i wear boho tops all the time and this looked terrible on me (i have broad-ish shoulders and a chest). i thought it would be a fun, drapey top for transition to fall but unfortunately it's going back.
10146	"I've been shopping at retailer since 2007, and floreat used to be my favorite designer, but for the past year or more, floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model.  1. it is long on her, not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this, i might try on a size m and give it another chance. 2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this, as mentioned above. 3. in the picture, t"
10147	A great casual top for warm weather - the linen ensures its structure stands out, and the structure gives it more interest than a plan tee. does a fine job of hiding minor midsection lumpiness. can be dressed up a bit if worn with linen or cotton trousers. i bought the yellow and was pleased to find it wasn't too transparent. i bought the small and found it tts for an american small (bigger than a uk or european small). a versatile keeper.
10148	I have to agree with previous reviewers in that it is a bit short on the top but i kind of like that as i am petite and most tops come way too long on me; however go up a size if you have any breasts at all. likely they will not fit in you standard size. however i just love this shirt. soooo adorable. the color is a bit more olive than brown to me though than what is in the pic :)
10149	This shirt is so comfortable and looks very nice with jeans or work pants. it's a great shirt!
10150	I had high hopes for this top. i love the plaid and design but found it too boxy and short. the front was cut too low as well.
10151	"It's always sunny when i wear this sunshine yellow tee.  love the color and they way it was pieced together.  has a flattering feminine fit whole still feeling relaxed and casual.  it's slightly sheer but not obscene.  all linen and a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i purchased medium and i'm 39/28/35 140# 5'3"""
10152	"I agree with the other reviewers, this top is completely disappointing in every way, i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin,....... it runs really big it's short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture. colors are completely dull in person, i really think this picture was lightened a great deal. fabric feels cheap and stiff lining is stuff and poorly sewn. i haven't one positive thing to say about t"
10153	"The style, plaid colors & cotton fabric really appealed to me in the pics. looks like it will be very cool & airy for these brutal hot days. ordered both the blue & purple in the size 6 for length. did not disappoint at all! looks pretty much on me as in the pic. a little surprise is that both tops have a thin metallic pinstripe spaced abt 3-4"" thruout the plaid. it's a silver metallic on the blue, & raspberry on the purple plaid. not obvious from far away but noticeable up close. a cute feature"
10154	Cute and simple.  nice fabric. it's a looser fit so if you're in between sizes i'd recommend the smaller size
10155	As other reviewers have said ~ the colors are more muted but good fall colors! quality top with lining and bead detail on hem and sleeves. flowy, loose fit ~ very cute with skinny jeans and booties. i would size down if you are small chested. great boho top.
10156	Great color and fabric! a bit on the sheer side but not completely see-through. perfect for spring, summer and even into fall. wore it on a weekend trip to the beach with capris and then to work with a cropped blazer. planning on ordering it in additional colors if it's still available. a good staple for your wardrobe!
10157	I ordered this top in xsp and xs. i don't think i let the xsp top breathe long enough, because i thought it was too short and sent it back. (there is no retailer near me...) i kept the xs, and at first thought the same thing about it not fitting right, but by the end of the day it stretched just enough, and felt just right. really pretty top. i received a lot of compliments on it.
10158	Really cute over my white cropped pilcro jeans. or as a beach cover up over a bathing suit. i want this in more colors!
10159	This skirt is stunning but i really wish it was cotton canvas - maybe by summer retailer could make one?
10160	I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings, but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though.
10161	"Great, really soft hoodie. i got an xxs petite and it's still a little big, but it works. i'm 5'1"", 95lbs."
10162	This dress is fantastic. super flattering and unique. i get a compliment every time i wear it. i encourage retailer to source more dresses from this brand/designer. lovely. i am picky and nevery give a perfect rating, this dress got all 5 stars.
10163	I love this tee. very soft and easy care. gentle cycle hand to dry.
10164	I usually wear a medium in jackets, took a chance with the small in this coat. it fits well, the arms are a bit snug but not too snug. beautiful design though. biggest disappointment was quality. i thought the jacket would be thick and warm. it's pretty thin, will test out warmth soon. overall decent purchase, would buy again.
10165	This wool jacket actually feels more as a cardigan, its a little too thin for a jacket but looks about the same as pictured. its very pretty. i ordered a l and it was true to size. sleeves are cropped. the wool material is surprisingly soft and comfortable. very nice and colorful addition to my closet. recommend! :)
10166	
10167	"I bought one of these tees for myself and one as a gift -- both in green, which is really a beautiful dark teal color (as pictured). the fabric is so soft that the gift recipient said she wanted ""an entire jumpsuit made of this fabric."" :) the shirt is long enough, loose enough and substantial enough to wear untucked, as pictured, but lightweight enough to tuck in to a pencil skirt. i am usually an xs or an s in tops, and i ordered the s in this one. the larger size gives the slightly loose fit"
10168	I saw these in the connecticut retailer but didn't want to pay full price. the very next week, they went on sale! i ordered xs (i'm 5'4, small frame, 120lbs). while the length is perfect, the waist is a bit tight for pjs. though, not tight enough to return as i love everything else about these. they're like wearing a painting of fine art! light weight flannel. hope they hold up well iin cold water wash!
10169	I just purchased this amazing jacket in the moss color in my regular size small (34d-27-35) at the store because my husband had commented about how cool it looked and i absolutely love it. this is the softest jacket ever and you wouldn't even know it's not real leather. the moss is more of a cross between a dark grey and green and it's so neat how it goes with so many outfits. the moss green does not make it difficult at all to match up with so many other colors like you would think due to it's
10170	I'm super into this top! i bought the evergreen color in store as it fit true to size and was very flattering. i went to buy an item that was available online only and decided to also buy this top in black. my favorite aspect about this shirt is that it can be dressed up or down. the material is slightly stretchy though it does not cling. i can wear a chunky necklace and dressy skinny pants and look ready for a nice dinner. on the other hand, this top can be thrown on with a pair of comfy jeans
10171	"This dress is amazing quality with stunning details. its flowy and absolutely beautiful. i plan on wearing it whilst im in the depths of the mongolian mountains while singing operatic arias. i ordered a size two regular, even though i am petite for the sole purpose of dress length. ---->in the picture, the dress comes down to an awkward length on the model, the sleeves are 3/4 and it doesnt look as good as it could if the length settled down to where their ankles are, or if the sleeves reache"
10172	I was looking for something to wear for an event at an art gallery. i actually really loved this dress! i think it hides body flaws. i tired on the xs, but the small was a little more flowing. it was comfortable and very fun to wear.. i am short, so the length was great for me i wore a different full length black slip under it which was more comfortable for me. go try it on too see if it fits for your body style. it was great for me
10173	Very soft for vegan leather. very stylish. i thought it ran slightly small for size indicated on jacket. daughter is 8-10 but medium was tight.
10174	This hoodie is beautiful, soft and flattering. but the soft fabric pilled badly after one wearing and it's probably going to look ratty after a few washings. i might accept pilling in a $30 sweatshirt but not at this price. i don't really want to take it back but i will. (i've complained to retailer employees in the past about other clothes pilling and poor quality, and they've always said i could bring it back)
10175	"I tried on the dress that was returned at my store in xxs p, i would not have based on reviews but my stylist asked me to try it on. it does look nice, you just have to cinch it all the way. perhaps most people do need to size down. for my 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5in waist, i wouldn't go up to xs p... to give an idea.  material is nice and sturdy. give ti a try!"
10176	This is a beautiful dress. all that's missing is a bonnet!
10177	It's beautiful, but more sheer on bottom than it appears in photo. size up.
10178	Cute shirt, great for a lazy day off. i got an xs, but i thought this was a bit lose especially around the waist. the shirt is good quality, the material is heavier, great for spring/fall. it goes well with leggings and a jacket.
10179	I wasn't sure the shorter length in the back was working until i tried it on. this jacket totally worked for me. the brown color can be easily matched with other colors. i got the jacket in medium size. i usually in between size. the medium size allow more space on the chest area, however the sleeve becomes a bit too long for me.
10180	This top is so cute it's my go to top. dress up or down looks really cute with skinny skirt. i have the ivory and just ordered the dark grey. one great thing this top has pockets. i would buy this in many colors if i could. yes it's full but a cute full. but i love full tops. i think this is true to size it's not tight and i don't think it would be as cute tight. i actually like mine on me better than the one on the model.lol washes like a dream and you can dry it in the dryer.
10181	This dress is really good quality and the beading is adorable. but, the sleeves combined with the maxi skirt made me look like i was a sister wife and not in a $250 dress. i still gave it four stars though, because i am having it hemmed to above the knee because i like the top part so much. i ordered the 00p, am 5'1 110 lbs and the waist fit perfect, the skirt was about three inches above my ankles. perhaps someone with a more boho style might find the length of the skirt cute but i just found i
10182	I got the red- it is a great color. this is one of those thin soft t shirts. it drapes really nicely and dresses up or dresses down. the only downside for me is that it takes a little extra effort in the washing department, but really not much- just have to line dry.
10183	I saw this in my local retailer, and was blown away by how soft it was! the minute i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off. for being a boxy cut, it was surprisingly flattering. i have a large chest and normally wear an xl in retailer clothes, but i could easily zip the size large all the way up. this is the perfect hoodie to wear running errands on the weekend, or with a pretty blouse on under it at work. i know i'll get a ton of use out of it, so i recommend it!
10184	I purchased this sock in another print before and wear them all the time. i was happy to see a new pair on the website and purchased them again! these liner socks actually stay on my feet... others brands i've tried before slip off my heel, but these stay hidden and stay put. plus a fun design!
10185	This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said, its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r
10186	"What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5'2"", but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i can't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me, so i'll be returning it."
10187	Another winner for me! this top drapes wonderfully, the lace is beautiful and looks fabulous on! i would highly recommend it!
10188	I love this unique piece. it is slightly over sized which is intended - cinches allow you to tighten the waist area/providing more definition. will look great with booties in the fall.. great boho dress.. the included slip runs small and short. however, if it's a piece you love, you could easily wear a different slip if you wanted something a little longer.
10189	So cheerful and colorful! love these cozy pj pants!
10190	This dress is very good quality, with beautiful beading on the bodice. it's a heavier material than i was expecting, but that was a pleasant surprise. unfortunately, when i put it on and looked in the mirror, i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid. the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and, combined with the overall design and length, i couldn't think of anywhere to wear it. this is an easy return for me. the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit
10191	Excited to get this sweater! i'm a 38c and usually wear a size 14 blouse so i ordered an xl as i don't like clingy sweaters. this was perfect; fitted but not tight. i'll be able to wear this with jeans and cute boots for lunches or nice slacks and heels for a dinner date. wish i could've gotten it for the 25% off + free s/h but glad i didn't wait - this size was sold out first.
10192	I fist saw this dress in the window in alexandria, va olde towne and i immediately said that i have to have it. upon receiving it in the mail, i was surprised by the quality of the dress. this dress is made very well. after trying it on it did look like i was going to be dancing with the hippies in woodstock. but i love the dress and plan on wearing it soon. good quality
10193	"After reading the other reviews, i had to write my own. i think this dress is adorable. it is a tunic and advertised as such. i think the drawcord and the way it is styled is really different and gives the dress some pop. i am 5'4"" so the length is good for me. i didn't have trouble with the arms as some did. the slip was a problem , too small, especially considering the dress is a tunic and fits as a tunic. the dress fits me as it does the model. with a pair of cute boots, this dress rocks."
10194	I loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on. in the dressing room area we were all laughing because (i tried on a small) when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldn't raise my arms. the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches! even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you weren't wearing a dress at all but a shirt. too bad. poor design for sure, and such a shame when th
10195	"My skirt arrived this week and its beautiful! i'm so happy i splurged on it. i'm usually a size 6 and the medium fits perfect, although it is quite long (i'm 5'2"" though;). i will probably get it hemmed, but went ahead and wore it anyway and actually found i like it a bit long and its very comfortable. the fabric is very high quality and the color is stunning."
10196	Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.
10197	This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute, not flattering, the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend, although it looks airy and comfy.
10198	Just received this beautiful jacket of quality wool and superior design. i love it and wore it christmas eve with tailored black pants. the fit is perfect in the shoulders, sleeve length and generous in the hips, waist. i used the tie to gather it in a bit at the waist, but plan to have an inch or so taken in on either side at the hip to avoid my looking too wide. a matter of preference, but i have most things tailored--a must at my age! i felt young and attractive rather than old and non-descri
10199	"I'm in love with this jumpsuit! i'm 39 y/old, 5.5"", 140lbs and ordered the 6 petite (my legs are a little challenged in the length department). it fits perfectly, and i get complimented every time i wear it. simple, yet elegant and stylish."
10200	George venson of vousta has designed a pair of pajama bottoms that are beautifully designed & comfy to lounge & sleep in. they are a light weight flannel that fit true to size & wash extremely well. the design on these pj's are like no other; a white background with red birds. polar bears, deer, all with tree branches running through the length of the pant. they're just delightful. you must try them!
10201	"I'm a petite girl, 5' and 100lbs. ordered regular size xs since others mentioned this being ""short"" or ""cropped"". this sweater is adorable, not itchy in my opinion, and the lenght is just right, not short, not long, however it may be a bit short for tall girls...still think it's worth a try."
10202	"I really love this dress! the fit is flattering and comfortable. the fabric has a pale art nouveau background, with indian and middle eastern prints over it. the beadwork does ""really pop,"" and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. for lovers of etro's bohemian style who don't want to spent thousands of dollars on a dress . . ."
10203	I'll start by saying, over the years, i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap, cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean, this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.
10204	When i first put this dress on, i immediately thought...oh no, i can't pull this off. at least, not without a cow to milk. but this dress is so comfortable. the material feels divine and the quality really is excellent for the price. the pattern of the panel on the bodice creates a slimming effect so it is also very flattering if you can get the waist to hit right. (i had to try on a few different bras to make this happen.) fits true to size. i got a size 2 - my usual size and i have gained a fe
10205	I was a little  hesitant to order it.  i am glad i did, it is a great top.
10206	"I was so excited to receive this dress. i got a petite 4 as i am 5'2"". it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible. it didn't look good on me. the waist line was a bit too high...maybe a regular would have looked better. also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn't. also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance. i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn't work for me and i had to send it back."
10207	"I love the patterns and the colors! easy to dress up or down.  i ordered a small and just ordered a can to compare them. the cut is great as the sides still meet even though there's no closure. it's a good weight for this weather and winter! i live in sweater coats where i am and this is a great addition. it's a little itchy, that's the only flaw."
10208	"Absolutely perfect and worth every penny! i am 5'8"" and normally between a 4 and 6 in jackets. while the small fit, i ended up purchasing a medium so i had more room in the arms. insanely comfortable and truly stunning on. expect compliments when you are wearing it!"
10209	The collar on this jacket is amazing; there is so much you can do with it to create different styles and looks. it gives it a glamorous edge with a classic uniqueness. the print contains vibrant colors - perfect for holiday parties as well as for work and other occasions. when you snap it, the material gets bunchy and awkward-fitting so it's best to wear it as a wrap. it is a little pricey in my opinion and i am guessing it is due to the perfect and flawless design that stands apart from some of
10210	I agree with almost everything the previous reviewer said with one notable exception: probably because she and i have very different figures, i am able to wear the sweater fully snapped with the belt cinching my waist creating a peplum effect. i wore this jacket to a party as a top over a black band aid skirt (code for tight-fitting and tastefully short) with black semi-opaque tights and black booties. the look was classy, but edgy having paired a delicate floral pattern and unusually feminine n
10211	I loved this on the cover of the august catalog. when i saw the pictures online, i was a bit hesitant because the background of the dress looked white, and i wondered whether it would be too washed out for me. not so. i love it! it fits beautifully; the waistline is very flattering. it looks like a dress a model would wear in the 1960s -- not a hippie, but a model in a high fashion magazine. it looks great with boots. the fabric is soft to the touch, so luxurious. i am of polish and lithuanian d
10212	"I love the fabric and details of this dress!! i was thrilled to see it in person. i plan on wearing it when the weather gets colder because of the styling of the dress. i am choosing to keep the hem where it is, and thus prefer it as a ""colder months"" dress. the poppy flowers really ""pop"" in this dress- love!!"
10213	This jacket is really pretty and unique. unfortunately the material around the waist area does not lay flat like it does in the picture. i'm 5 ft 6 in and a size 6. i ordered the medium. it fit well but the material around the waist area jutted out making me look really wide. disappointed to have to return this.
10214	"Absolutely beautiful jacket...the craftsmanship is amazing, and the colors remind me of a impressionist water color. the jacket runs true to size (i'm 5'7"" and 115 pounds with a 30e bust and the extra small fit perfectly). unlike the other reviewers, i didn't have issue with the bottom not lying flat or the collar bunching up. i wore it with a green leather pencil skirt and suede stilettos, but you can also wear it with skinny jeans as well.i got this very deeply discounted, and although it is i"
10215	I was lucky enough to see this in store when it went on sale and although i rarely wear leather/vegan jackets i tried it on. i am torn on sizing i'm normally a m or 8/10 in retailer but the m fit slightly tight in the waist and the l was slightly loose. i ended up with the l in the moss color, since i can layer and don't really want the jacket too cropped. i also saw the brown and tried that on but for me the moss color was much richer.
10216	This piece is comfortable and easy to pair with leggings or denim. soft and not too heavy.
10217	"This is just as it looks. a minimalist, elegant, dark navy skirt that provides a classic feminine shape and looks like it could last for years. it is straight, so you might want to consider sizing up unless you're quite slender. i'm 5'10"" and 160 and am sending back a m for a l. excited to get my new skirt and to wear it."
10218	I wanted to love this because it's all my favorites: simple, chic design; pure silk; gorgeous color. in reality, the dress was 100% see-through, very thin, and poor quality silk. i posted pictures of me wearing this dress with a nude slip on underneath that i brought along for shopping elsewhere for business dresses. despite the thin quality of the silk, i was still considering spending this dress (despite it's unreasonably high $$$ for the quality), but after trying it on i was really disappoin
10219	
10220	"I didn't have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress, i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy, itchy polyester-like fabric, not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black, not the plum color in 4/5 photos. but most importantly, i am 5'8"" and the dress is very short on me. it'"
10221	It does snag easily which stinks because it's darling and i love it to pieces.... i just hope it doesn't end up in pieces!
10222	"The previous review by beardedlady said it best: ""yes, i do still feel like a little girl playing dress up in it but i don't care. this is a fun, creative dress to be worn on the days when you feel like having a julie andrews moment.""    in my own opinion, i don't think i can wear this without a topper covering the poufy shoulders so i'm happy that i own the dara moto jacket in plum to toughen up the look. i am 38-27-35/36c/135# and the bodice feels a little loose all over with the size 10 re"
10223	
10224	I had my eye on this jacket (in moss) for awhile. i was afraid the vegan leather wouldn't feel natural or soft but i was wrong. it's wonderfully soft - so much so that every time i wear it and tell someone it's vegan leather, they feel compelled to touch it and can't get over the quality. the detailing is great and the back adds a special, interesting touch. it's become my go-to jacket and works just as well with jeans as it does with a nice dress. and who doesn't love getting a compliment every
10225	This jacket feels like quality and has beautiful detailing. one thing to note though, the proportions are a little odd - it is cut very high in the back (at the waist) and the sleeves seem over-long.
10226	Soft, elegant, beautiful and makes me feel special! what more could one ask for? fit is true to size and has various styling options. best retailer purchase in some time.
10227	Great wardrobe staple! at 119, i ordered the s and the fit was great. you can wear this so many ways and it's soft!
10228	This vest is the best!! even though it has no sleeves it truly keeps you warm. it feels like you're wearing a soft blanket around you. it is my favorite!
10229	One word: obsessed. feel like a carrie bradshaw bohemian queen. sturdy and luxurious, pretty fancy, definitely queen-worthy. i&amp;amp;#39;m walzing around my house in this dress listening to john mayer and feeling fab
10230	This dress is stunning.  it may be my new favorite thing!  i'm not sure where you are to wear this as it is really fancy but i will wear it to work and church anyways--even if it is a bit on the dressed up side.  the fit it true to size.  i am 5'8 and the length is similar to that on the model in the photo. zipper troubles!  i can zip it off of my body--but when one when it comes to the thicker part where the zipper is i cannot zip it--decided could zip halfway and still shimmy in.
10231	I love the long tunic with high slits, it's such a great design. i bought this on sale on a whim. i did see that there was already a small snag on the one i purchased right after i took it out of the bag, must have missed that when i looked at it in the store. i still love it, just a little worried based on other reviews that i won't be able to keep from snagging in the future. at the sale price i would say still worth it though!
10232	I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this dress, based on the previous reviews. for me, it fit perfect. the blouse was fine, not too much fabric. the skirt is soft and stretchy. the fit was tts. for reference, i am 120lbs, 34c and i purchased the 4p. it fits great!
10233	"I wore this blazer for one day, didn't do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable, since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.  as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it's good over something cute.  or, it would be, if it didn't fall apart."
10234	I saw this romper online and knew i needed it as i love flannels and i love rompers. it's super comfy. i bought with the intention of wearing it out, not just around the house. i think in the fall it will be cute with high socks and boots but as i just got it, i've been opting for tights. lots of compliments so far. i got a small because i didn't want it to be too short, it fits well.
10235	"I wanted to love this romper, but it just wasted right for me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered size small. i may have liked it better with more room in the medium, decided to return. i still recommend trying this product, but it wasn't for me and my hips!"
10236	I purchased this top in both colors while on sale. it fits true to size. the material is heavier than i expected, but that just means it should hold up for a long time. recommend
10237	This si=hirt actually has a shimmer to the fabric. it is more of sweatshirt material but i like the thickness, not too thick not too thin. the color is nice in person, and has a shimmer to it. i like the detail in the neck too with the sequins. reason i didn't get it is it felt a little big on me (smallest is xs) and also the color wasn't optimal (i am rather pale). otherwise, i do like the shirt.
10238	I meant to order both red and blue and added to red in my basket by accident, oops, meant to be? the color is very nice, not too bright holiday red, but nice rich red. the cut is very flattering too. i didn't expect to love it as much on. i ordered the xxs p, length was not too high/cropped, perfect. the asymmetrical hem gives some visual interest to the sweater, so does the fun neckline with keyhole on the side... fun take on a sweater... for me, the fabric was comfortable. i am 115 lbs, 30dd,
10239	"I saw this online and was pleased they had it in blue at the store. the blue is more of a gray, but it's a great color. i tried on the small and my daughter said ""you look pretty, mommy."" i was sold! i love the cascade on the side."
10240	I have been staring at these shorts since they first appeared and finally decided to treat myself to them for my birthday. when they came in the mail i was so excited and they in person are even more beautiful and well made then in the picture. but be warned these shorts are rather short so if you don't mind showing a bit of leg these will be right up your alley.
10241	"I absolutely love these shorts. i do, however feel they run on the large side. i am 5'1"" and normally wear a 24, 25, 0 or 00 and bought these in an xs. i would have gotten an xxs if they were available, but that was not an option. they are a little baggy, but they are so great i could not pass them up. these are too good to pass on."
10242	Very happy with the fit of this sweater, which is flattering and unique. the ruffle elevates the piece. very soft and a good length for me (i got a medium) in both the sleeves and the body. the hole at the neck gaps a little, which may bug me as time goes on, but otherwise i am so pleased with this sweater that i am willing to put up with it. i ordered this in the red, which is more of an orangey red, which does not suit my skin tone. i will exchange for the blue/gray version.
10243	This sweater is perfect for cool days.  the fit is true to size, though a bit longer than in the photos, especially the sleeves (i'm petite).  i actually liked the length so did not order petite.  the sweater is a relatively soft cotton blend.  it is comfortable and the ruffle adds just the right amount of finesse.  the ruffle is stitched on all the way, so it doesn't open in front, which is a plus.  the blue grey is marled and more grey than blue.  the red is beautiful and as pictured.
10244	This is a very well made top, i like the cut and it fits true to size. very nice quality and the colors schemes are unique. i'm happy with this purchase.
10245	Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately, none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;)
10246	I love this brand, i literally live in their tops.. this one is a bit of a disappointment. it is made out of fabric that feels cheap, reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products. it's very thin, and see through. unless wearing a camisole/slip underneath, you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath- no muffin tops or back fat!!i got the black, and am keeping it only because i love the design, need a black top desperat
10247	This looks just as good in person as it does online.   true to size.  definitely warm, but not too heavy.  comfortable as well.
10248	This romper fits well and is flattering. i love the relaxed style. the quality is quite poor, though. one leg ripped the second time i wore it and the fabric, while soft and comfortable, is fraying and pilling like crazy. after only two brief wears, the romper looks cheap and old. i expect much better quality at this pricepoint. really disappointed.
10249	These are gorgeous and not too short or too long which is oddly hard to find! they're mostly tts, but if you're between sizes i'd go up a size because the small was slightly snug on me and i'm a 4/6. i'm hopeful that they'll stretch a little with wear because i think the medium would be too loose.
10250	I was excited when i saw these shorts in my local retailer store. i wear a 25 sometimes 26 and i grabbed an xs. however, when i tried these shorts on i was sad to see that they run big and looked baggy on me. they fit, but are really loose. i am probably going to have to return these because they don't come in an xxs. they are great shorts and a perfect length, but make sure you size down.
10251	I bought this sweater on sale and love it. it's very sweet, comfortable, and unique. it fits true to size.
10252	This is an adorable top. i purchased both the green and the blue. the colors and look are so much nicer than the photos of it. this is a stock up item.
10253	"I truly feel guilty wearing these outdoors. it is incredibly comfortable, so much so that i asked the sales girl if these were pjs or actually worn out. i'm usually between a s and m. both fit fine, but i went with the m to have a bit more room and allow the top to be a bit more ""flannel"" flowy. the top has enough length that i can actually let it droop over the waist bet a bit. the length is definitely upper thigh on me (5'8"" @ 145), but rest assured, nothing is hanging out. it's actually the p"
10254	I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p, as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015, and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p, it was much too
10255	"I first saw this online and was worried the design might look awkward in real life...not on a model, but tired it on in store and it looks great!  it has a tighter fit and seems to flair out in just the right place.  just the right thickness, not too thin or thick.  i am 5'6"", 124lb, 34b and got the xs.  i did not try on the s for comparison as i thought the xs fit great.  i'm always either an xs or s with retailer tops. blue is definitely more steel. interesting piece! will not disappointed!"
10256	This is cute! i was hesitant to buy, but glad i did. it has a unique cut. the fit is tighter to the body, but it's very flattering. i purchased a xxs petite in the blue color. the blue seems more on the gray side to me, but it is mottled and really pretty. the neckline comes all the way up - as shown. the detail on the neckline and the ruffle shown at a bias is really cool. i love it. pair it with a skirt or jeans. adorable!
10257	This is the softest flannel ever! while i don't think i'd wear it outside, it is super comfy just lounging around. it runs very large, but since it's a flannel romper, not a problem. absolutely recommend for all shapes and sizes!
10258	"I am very particular about jeans. it's not just the look; it;s the feel and the quality of the fabric that won me over. the mid-rise wide-leg crop is perfection. i'm 5'7"" and a size 8. these are extremely flattering and versatile to go casual or incorporate into a more professional feel. great way to show off some of the fabulous fall footwear options as well. i highly recommend."
10259	Very comfortable, fit over my muscle-y and flabby arms! very pretty.
10260	These are great pants! i sized up from my typical size 28 because i found the rise to be a little low for me. i tend to like my pants a little higher on my waist. the sa said these ran a little smaller for most. when i got home, i put them up to my size 28's and they were the same. (what woman likes to go up a size?) i purchased the black;great for work and play. i would like the holly too but i am waiting.
10261	Love this dress! ?? i tried it on at the store and loved how it felt on. i put it on hold to think about it and returned later that day to purchase. i am glad i did. the 1st day i wore it i received numerous compliments!
10262	This is the one. the faux fur i have been looking for. it is plush and heavy so that it should keep me warm and toasty during the dreaded new england winter. i love the richly saturated jewel tones over a base of black . there are only two snaps to close the front but there is enough fabric to overlap to keep the cold away. maybe winter won't be so bad after all.... one caveat is that the item description is not truly accurate. i initially ordered a petite since the length stated was almost 37 i
10263	This top is gorgeous dress it up for work or wear with jeans for a more casual look. the top fits true to size and the lace is not overdone . i would recommend this and can't wait to wear it.
10264	"This dress embodies the retailer brand. the design is unique, and form fitting for just about any body type. beautiful saturated colors and a great cut make it an all around classic. i wish for more of these designs. i originally ordered my usual size 4, but went down to a 2. this dress runs large. looks great with heels or boots as pictured. i am 5'6"" 134 lb. this dress has a timeless quality that you will wear for years to come. at my age, i try to buy things that i will wear for many sea"
10265	Adorable, true to size and just as pictured. there is no hook and eye clasp as stated but still cute. light weight and will be perfect over dresses and summer tanks. wish there were additional colors. i love the white though.
10266	As other reviewers have pointed out, the bum is not flattering. the pockets are wide and the fit sort of flattens you out. bummer. literally. too bad, i wanted these to work more than then coh's parker cropped. the coh's win. my wallet loses.
10267	
10268	Beautiful detail and soft sweater. i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short. arms were long and baggy in comparison. given the fit, i didn't think the small would work. really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back.
10269	Can easily be worn with boots or sandals - multi season dress. comfortable, flattering cut. slightly roomy, but pretty true to size.
10270	Easy to wear and layer. thin and light casual fabric, not itchy. great basic addition to my closet!
10271	The fabric is beautiful.  didn't wrinkle so much after 8 hours in a suitcase.  as opposed to the other reviewer mine arrived neatly, stripes match nicely.  i am kind of thick waisted and the size 6 was still perfect for me - i am currently 130 lbs, 34-28-35.  love the colors and the fabric, a nice cotton twill, lined, pockets, pretty bow belt.  i am not a fan of the size zipper style but it is not a deal breaker.  glad i have them !!
10272	These pants fit the bill! they're soft and very comfortable. easy to wear day and night. these are a little higher on the waist, which i love. purchased two pair! i purchased the regular and they come to my ankles.
10273	Love these crops. fitted through hips with full legs. at 5'7 and 125, the 27 fit perfect. these look great with block heels and wedges. denim is lightweight, perfect for fall.
10274	"I think i received a mislabeled vest?? when i opened the package, i thought it was some sort of joke!  i was expecting what the stock photos show, a longer length flowy sweater vest.... mine was literally child sized. i'm not a big person at all.. i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and wear a 6/8. i ordered this in a m/l, thinking i would like it loose. i tried it on thinking, maybe it will look longer once on.. no.. not even. i looked ridiculous. the front hit above the waist of my jeans and the back hit middl"
10275	Bought this blouse in white. fits great. can be worn with many things. dressed up or down.
10276	My daughter had one and wore it with everything.i ended up getting one myself.it is a perfect weight.
10277	Bought these over the weekend and i am in love! they are very soft, extremely flattering, and the rich green color is fantastic. i may go back for the black. i went with my usual size 28 for reference, and the fit is great. these will be a fall staple, for sure!
10278	"These are amazing. so comfortable, true to size (i usually wear a 29 in pilcro and ag and bought these in a 29). i have curvy thighs and a smaller waist but didn't get a gap situation with these. the only issue i have is the length. i'm 5'6"" and wish they were a tiny bit shorter. they hit right at the top of my foot so i keep debating if i should cuff them or not, since the length looks more flattering cuffed but then the actual cuff looks a little weird. i bought them in black for work, and now"
10279	This top is pretty and i did not find it sheer at all but i am returning it due to the lace sleeves are tight. but, i do have large arms! other than the sleeves i would keep it!
10280	Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.
10281	Can't love this dress enough. i have to force myself not to wear too often. i get stopped every single time i wear it to get complimented. i'm usually a size 6 or 8 in dresses. went with the 8 after trying both on. i found the arms fit better with the 8. i'm pretty athletic and 5'5' around 140 lbs.
10282	I love this sweater, it's so soft, and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it. it runs true to size, but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more, it seems to stretch a little. overall, i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it!
10283	"I have a love affair with pilcro and these jeans make my heart throb. i've been stalking these jeans online and tried them on in the store yesterday. i'm 5'9"", curvy, and was concerned that they would make my legs look like tree trunks swathed in denim with miniature cartoon feet protruding from below the hem. not so. they fit like a glove, rested perfectly at my lower calf, hugged around the hips and waist, and flared without looking like church bells. seriously, if you're a cropped pants fan,"
10284	But tight around the chest, i ordered xs petite after trying on xxs petite and both are a tad tight on the chest area, kept xs petites as bigger would be too much fabric everywhere else. green color is classic, and the back is longer than the front. overall flattering if with the right outfit. i'm 30 dd and 115 lbs for reference.
10285	
10286	I love the look of this dress but wish the bottom was lined like the top is. it's a little sheer without the lining.
10287	"This sweater is just as pictured. the fit is true to size, though it is a looser style rather than fitted sweater. it is short, though not cropped, and the sleeves are 1-2"" too long, but it is still flattering. it hits at the top of my hip and it looks great with high-waisted flares. the scallop detail is perfect, just enough interest, but not overbearing. the material is soft and heavier than expected. it is a good weight for fall. i wish it was made of natural fibers instead of synthetics, but"
10288	Love these new jeans. they fit perfect and are extremely flattering. they look great with a crop style top and flats!
10289	I was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price. it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket. the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining. in addition, the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba
10290	I liked this bc it is long, ivory and thin. i think it will be a versatile piece to wear with tees & casual dresses. it has a little hook & button closure up on one shoulder if you wish to wear it more as a wrap. looks cute that way too.
10291	I bought this top in the black color and it's great! the lace sleeves are so soft- not itchy at all and it is very flattering.
10292	These pants are so flattering, comfortable, and silky smooth. a versatile fall staple for sure. i bought my usual 28 and they fit perfectly.
10293	Nice twist on a basic t-shirt. pictures don't tell the full tale. better in person. bought the cream one. loving it.
10294	Oh my this is the best cardigan ever. quality is superb and so soft. i am between a 12 and 14 so i ordered the xl, this cardigan fits true to size. will order more if more colors become available.
10295	I really like this dress! i wasn't sure what to expect when i ordered it, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. it fits well and it's very cute and different.
10296	Purchased as a gift for someone who needs to up her pj ante -- soft cute fun
10297	This top is very sweet and looks lovely on the model. it was not flattering for my larger bust, with the inverted pleat opening at my bustline and spreading out over my waist. the quality is nice, the fit in the shoulders is snug. the length is a bit short for me, but it may lay better on a different body type.
10298	I love everything about this dress. the coloring, fabric and flow of it. it's so much better in person than on-line. it's true to size and very comfortable. a great price as well.
10299	These pants were pretty different then my typical style, but i love them! they come down a bit longer then i think they are supposed to because i have shorter legs, but i still think they are cute- especially with a heel or clog. good quality, well made.
10300	My title says it all. this coat is sure to turn heads everywhere you go. the colors in the coat are beautiful jewel tones and differnt then you will see anywhere. it is so soft and warm and makes me feel fabulous. i feel it fits tts i am short and the regular lent was fine on me. get this before it's gone.
10301	Online this jacket is supposedly an online exclusive, but i saw it in green at my local store. i had to try it on and i loved it. it does swing but is not to much fabric. the drape is really nice it is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it sort of shows that on the model but is much more noticeable in person. this jacket is not lined and i would say more of a shirt. this is perfect for spring or cooler summer nights or over a tank or short sleeve in the winter. i also love lyocell it j
10302	"This is a beautiful dress and i would recommend. but it was short on me (tall), not the midi i was hoping for. and a little too low cut (too much cleavage), i'm a d cup. since i paid full price, i have to be completely pleased with my purchase, for this reason i will return.  maybe if i had bought it on sale price, then i would keep."
10303	I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!
10304	Ordered a petite and it was not as dark of a denim like the picture. the pockets on the backside are wide and are not flattering if you have any curve to your rear. makes you look wider than you are! pocket on front are also large, which accentuate thighs. these were returned immediately as it did not work for me.
10305	I tried the green one on in the store, as my store only had the green. the lace was sort of fuzzy-looking and i couldn't tell if the items were shop-worn or if the lace was supposed to look like that. since they all looked that way, i decided it was the look of the original fabric and i tried it on. i do like the combination of the lace sleeves and v-neck. a bit dressy but casual also. although i sometimes appreciate a little forgiveness in the tummy area, in this case the design was too loose a
10306	"I ordered this shirt online in green, size small. i am 5'4"" and 120 lbs. i was a little worried the small might be too long &/or tentlike (i probably would have ordered a petite small had it been available), but it fits great!!! i love the earthy color combined with feminine lace... unique, comfy, gorgeous!"
10307	"I just love everything about these jeans, and everyone that sees them on me seems to as well! i'm short (5'2"") and was concerned about the length on me because they didn't have the petite in my size- but these seem to be just fine. i wear them with a bit of a heel, so that helps. they fit snugly (but not too tight) in all the right places, i have a bit of a backside so that's a plus for me! because of the higher waist, they also don't ride down.  except for the shorter length, they remind me a l"
10308	Bought this dress as good transition piece into our hot fall. don't usually go for the uneven hemline. but got so many compliments, i'm expanding my comfort zone.
10309	These pants are so perfect, i bought 3 pairs. perfect for casual friday's, a night out or the weekend.
10310	This dress is gorgeous in color and print; i think it can be styled as eclectic or elegant as you'd like. definitely runs big in the shoulder/bodice area, so i sized down.
10311	"This top is beautiful on. i did not find it to be sheer in either the black or the ivory, of which i tried both on. i purchased the black as it was more stunning. i am a medium and it fit absolutely perfect. it has a nice pleat in the front, in case you have a teeny bit of tummy. i found it to be very flattering and will wear it as a date top. it will look awesome with skinny jeans or ponte ankle leggings. the body fabric is a lighter cotton. i am 5'4"" and it hits at hip length. it does not have"
10312	These jeans are adorable!  i wear a 10p and the 30 petite fit perfectly. great quality and will look cute with a boxy crop top and flats.
10313	"I wanted a dress that made me feel pretty while traveling, when we went out in the evening. nothing really fancy but nice. i saw this right when it came out and the colors and cut were exactly what i was looking for. i am 5' 3"", and normally a size 6 in retailer dresses, but i have a dd34 chest and a little broader ribcage, even though my shoulders and hips are small , which can be tricky. the fit and flare style helps a lot but only if the torso is not too tight. i went back and forth over the si"
10314	"This top is very light and soft for summer. even the lace is soft. it's not sheer and doesn't require layering. true to size. i'm 5'4"", 34dd, 150 lbs- m fits well. my arms are not tiny and yet the lace weren't tight for me. but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer. it's good if you are paying the sale price."
10315	This dress is seriously gorgeous, and even more so in person. the cut at the bottom is so flattering for curvy , pear shaped, and hourglass shaped women. i sized down so that the dress gave me more of a waist than you can see on the model and it was so much more flattering. love the fabric, fit and style of this dress.
10316	"You do not want to know how many cropped, wide-leg jeans i've tried on. all the rest make me look ridiculous for various reasons....it's not easy to get this style right, apparently. these are great: comfy, make my legs look cute, not chopped off, they are not mysteriously tight in the upper thigh (why do some do that?) they act like trousers with a jean's casual edge. the ""let out"" hem is super cute and they are soft and comfortable. perfect with tucked in or shorter blouse styles.  i bought"
10317	These pants are so great. i was debating between them and some sateen denim style pants from another store, but these definitely take the cake. the fit is awesome--although i am a 26 in the green and a 27 in the black, so that's kind of weird.
10318	Fun transitional dress for fall that can be worn with ballet flats, boots or booties. true to size. for reference i am 5'9, 138 with an athletic build.
10319	I wanted to love this dress but the sizing was too large for me, overwhelming my frame. i am very petite; for reference, 5'2, 24 waist, 30, and usually get an xxsp or 00p but even the 00p was too large in both the waist and especially in the shoulder area. at minimum for fit, i would have had to have the dress taken up but required too much alteration. the skirt is not lined which i found disappointing, given the price. the colors and handkerchief like hem is really cute though but i returned.
10320	"I really did want to love these jeans but i had to return them.  im a size 10 and a little heavier in the thighs and got a 30. the rise is just to high for me and the thigh was very tight.   the denim felt fabulous they just fit me a bit funky."
10321	I had mixed feelings about this dress. the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd. it has two slips, one that fits close and a second that's a bit too puffy. so the skirt didn't sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger. the odd length made it unflattering. it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i didn't want to risk it.
10322	"Love these! loose and comfy everywhere. delighted to have found a 32, and delighted that they are roomy, even at the waist. i exchanged another pair of pilcro's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict, but as usual, retailer customer service was excellent. earlier sale price was honored, easy returns in the orignal shipping bag..  retailer design, fashion and company attitude excels!"
10323	"I am 5'7"", approx. 135 lbs, 27-28 in jeans, size 4 in dresses. purchased these in a size 8. i would suggest sizing up between one to two sizes. as a result, the upper thigh portion of the shorts do appear a little baggier - plus pleats - can be overwhelming in terms of material - but not so baggy that it would make it ""circus tent""-like. do not expect these to be fitted.definitely a fun pair of shorts. seems like it will go well with sandals, espadrilles, wedges. paired with either a front-tucke"
10324	I tried these on in the store and was unsure about sizing. once they went on sale i bought the xs and have already worn them twice.good transitional grey colored short into fall. need to be ironed or steamed after wearing for a while but comfy and smooth out easily.
10325	As with my other pilcro pants, i love the fit of these jeans. very soft fabric but don't stretch out too much after first wearing. the fabric is distressed but not so much that i worry about holes forming.
10326	I loved these and wore them once (i bought the red ones) and the stained my furniture and my shirt so i washed them a few times in hopes of getting out all the extra dye- ruined yet another chair!!! so annoyed. i loved them but they are not worth it.
10327	The only negative about this dress was the placement of the stripe across your stomach
10328	I absolutely love these sleep pants. they are very comfortable and the cute tea cups print makes them fun. i have washed them and put them in the dryer and they didn't fade or shrink. grab a pair while you still can you won't regret it.
10329	The fabric quality and style are amazing. the fabric is very high quality and so soft and the style is nice for an adult. i generally don't wear shorts because of length, style and other problems but i can wear these without feeling like a high schooler. i usually wear a 24/00 in pants, i ordered the 0 and was worried that it would be too loose and look sloppy on me but it fits amazingly. one of my favorite purchases ever!!!
10330	"This dress is cut perfectly to have a lot of movement. love the colors. i went with my usual size 2 and it fit generously. i am 5.4 and the size 2 hit about the same as the model.   my only complaint: it came really wrinkled and will definitely not make a travel dress."
10331	I followed the advice of the other reviewer and went 2 sizes up, i'm so glad that i did. i'm usually an 8 and i ordered a 12 and they are just right. the pleats made them very flowy in the hip, so it gives a little wider look on me than i really want, but i really love these shorts, so it's not a deal breaker. overall, i am happy with them, but definitely size up!
10332	Wore it this weekend and the compliments were overflowing! it's exceptionally flattering for busty women (i'm a 32dd). i had to size down from an 8 to a 6, but even the 8 looked good, just a bit loose in the bodice. v neck is just right, not too low, not too high. print is gorgeous in person - colors are much richer than the online photo. the flowy skirt is very slimming and forgiving for hourglass and pear shaped body types. but if you have slim hips, you might feel like you're swimming in fabr
10333	I love these pants! best fitting pants i've ever owned. flattering. stretchy/don't stretch out. i am so sad that retailer didn't plan well and stock enough. i bought the black, want the gray and all sizes but 25 and 31 are sold out. i might just buy another black pair so i can have another. i really wish retailer would re-stock these!!!! although these are 5star pants, i rated them a 3 for retailers poor / low stock quantity.
10334	This top runs a little bit larger and if you have bat wings you might want to stay true to size. i haven't washed or dry cleaned yet although most retailer shirts i have come to find new to be dry cleaned. otherwise fit is great so is the overall aesthetic.
10335	So nice. lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs. will look stylish on all heights. very impressed with the styling and construction. fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage.
10336	"This dress is quite the stunner! i love the mix of patterns and the asymmetrical hem. four stars in quality, though, as it could have a bit of pure cotton in the fabric composition, as opposed to rayon + viscose only. still, a versatile dress, for day or night. i love the length of the petite size (please note i'm 5' 4"") the shortest part of the hem hits right at the knees. a keeper."
10337	"These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops.   the fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online.   the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren't on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a ""1920s circus diaper"" look which is not good.   they're also really tight compar"
10338	"These jeans are perfect--exactly what i was looking for. i was afraid the rise might be too high but it was just right, well below the belly button. i abhor anything resembling a ""mom jean"" rise. they will look really chic with boots as well as sandals or flats. i have lots of pants in my wardrobe but i have a feeling this will be a favorite pair."
10339	This dress is beautifully tailored and so flattering. i feel very comfortable wearing it to work because of the sleeves and neckline, but think it would also be good to wear out. i'm so happy i bought it.
10340	"I adore eva franco but these are just not thoughtfully designed regarding fit. i wear a size 12 and took the risk of ordering the 12 as a popback, but they do fit 1-2 sizes small. i could get them zipped but it's not a good look. i feel like the waist would fit if the rise weren't so short. for reference, i have a 33"" waist and 42"" hips."
10341	I love this top. i typically wear small in most retailer tops and decided to size down in this to an xs and i'm glad i did. well made and cute floral design that can be worn year round.
10342	This dress is simply unique   beautiful! i said it runs large, but that only because the bodice is a little looser than anticipated. i decided to stick with my normal size 0 though so i could have a little extra room. for those wishing for a tight fit, size down. i love the colors in this dress; i typically shy away from bright colors and pinks but paired with the muted yellow/brown
10343	I saw this in the sales rack and decided to try it on, and i'm so glad i did. it looks very ordinary on the hanger, but, in fact, it's a very surprising find, as others have mentioned. _____________ pros: - a-line so you could go down a size for a slimmer fit. - the zipper in the back has an attached pleather-like tag to help in zipping the dress up. i found this extremely considerate and smart; most dresses don't have this. - lots of stretch and very, very comfortable. i can see myself wearing
10344	I love this sweater's rich color and good quality, but the fabric is very thick and heavy, the neck opening is too wide, and the length is too short to be flattering not on my tall (not model skinny) frame.
10345	"I'm typically a 27. this 27 seems snug but there isn't a 28 in petite so i'm keeping these 27 petites. i ordered 27 regular also and they are too long. i'm 5'4"" 128lbs. they are very comfortable. hope they stretch just a tad."
10346	I travel a lot and like to wear something other than jeans when i go out in europe. these pants are comfortable and yet i can dress them up. great fit and really nice fabric. i bought these in two colors.
10347	Gorgeous colors, high quality. my only word of caution is that the top part is very tight. if you have a large chest (c+) this is going to be snug, or not fit at all. i'm wearing it now in pregnancy, but i think it will also look great post-partum. can be dressed up or down.
10348	Tracy reese always pleases. this coat is absolutely awesome. it is gorgeous! the faux fur is soft and cozy. this coat is warm. i love the snap closure. this is the sort of attire that makes you feel lovely and is cheerful for those dull winter days. so happy to have in my wardrobe. a collector's item, for sure.
10349	I love these jeans. at first, i was unsure of what shoes to wear with the length of the crop. i don't wear block high heels ( as pictured) everyday chasing after my boys. but once i figured out which shoes looked cute i was in heaven. the fit is very flattering and it will be a great jean for everyday fun!
10350	"This dress has a charming ""carefree"" look that invites fall."
10351	This dress is absolutely beautiful. i wear with with a flat shoes gold. i got a lot of complaints. i was witing the fall season finale antro bringing what i want.
10352	"I am a big tracy reese fan, she knows how to cut a dress to flatter the best and hides the worst of a woman's body. i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips and size regular 4 fits very well, it makes my waist look tiny which is awesome and the length is right at my knees. the v neck is a bit low cut so i would need a camisole if worn to work. i like the 2 layer skirt slip, but the ruffle part at the hem needs to be steamed straight or the dress would look too bumpy. colors are rich and unique!"
10353	What a fun dress to wear. it feels great, and looks great. i feel good when i wear it. if i was a kid i would wear it everyday, ha ha.
10354	I'm in between a medium and a large and i ended up with a large because of the sleeves, which are fitted. the sleeve looks loose on the model, but i have some muscle on my bones. the v-neck is a little low and i will probably war a cami underneath, something i would have done in a medium as well. overall i like the top, i got the green. it has a nice style and will stand alone in warmer months without a jacket or sweater over it.
10355	Pleasantly surprised with how cute and flattering this dress is. i'm about a size 12 and the size l fit perfectly. the bit of a line to the skirt is very flattering. and the knit is not too clingy.
10356	I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable. the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy. i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too. they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer. these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear.
10357	"I stopped into a store near me specifically to try these on given how adorable they look here. while i liked them, i didn't love them. i love some stretch, so that part was good. however, the denim was much thinner and lighter colored than they look to me online here.    i really want to love them, though their light color has me less enthusiastic. another reviewer also mentioned a butt-flattening effect, which i noticed also. i might have sprung for them anyway, they do have a cute shape, bu"
10358	I at first only intended to try this jacket on and get a feel for the fit and style, as i've been looking for spring/fall in-between weather outerwear. but i unexpectedly (and maybe unfortunately for my bank account) fell in love instantly. the fabric is very soft, and the cut is cute, stylish, and flattering. the quality seems good, and the fit is perfect. i ordered an xs regular in the moss color.
10359	
10360	I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.
10361	Beautiful skirt but runs small. not for eveyone- this is for those with flat stomachs. i had to size up from a 6 to an 8 for my stomach to not stick out in this skirt and then it looked to wide on the bottom and lost the slick pencil look. if you are fit and firm this is a gorgeous skirt. it is lined and fabric somewhat heavy.
10362	"Overall, quite good red skirt, though a little clingy material. good that it has lining. the waist is elastic. xs fits great on me (5'4"", 120lbs)."
10363	"These are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not 10.5 like the description says, which is the only reason i gambled on these it is 13""."
10364	I'm a new mom, and am thrilled at the structure and quality of this dress. it gives me a great shape, very flattering. i can wear it to work with a jacket or dress it up with jewelry for a fancier event.
10365	"I was really hoping that this dress would fit perfectly because it looks beautiful on the model! however, when i put the dress on, there is a seam where the top portion meets the bottom portion and it made the skirt stick out a ton. i ordered the 0p and i am 5'4"" 110lbs. maybe ordering this dress in a larger size would prevent the skirt from looking so full at the top."
10366	Tried this skirt on in the store and loved it...so pretty,feminine and versatile,except for the color.. although its a gorgeous color and i do love red,how often do people wear red skirts? i would have snatched it up if it were offered in other colors. unlike the other reviewer,i think the ruching is great as it gives you the option to wear the skirt higher or lower on your waist and adds the axtra interest factor. as this would be a totally frivolous buy,i'm going to resist and try to wait for
10367	I love the cut of these pants! kind of a flare, kind of a boot cut and super flattering. they are long so really need heels to keep a nice leg. they have tons of stretch so i could wear two different size. i choose the smaller for a little less length in the leg. i consider them more pants then denim.
10368	This dress is a beautiful cut, and thankfully, it comes in petite so it fit my frame. i ordered it in my usual size in both 2r and 2p and will be returning the r. checks are cute and can be dressed up for work or for social event depending on goal. fabric is a little scratchy but texture and cut are great.
10369	I'm not normally one to spend $89.99 on a dress from retailer, but when this dress arrived in the mail it was a no-brainer that i would keep it. it hangs beautifully on your body and the fabric is extremely comfortable the tie at the waist is really flattering and the neckline adds a little bit of fun. i imagine it can go from season to season pretty easily: springtime with a cardigan and flats --> summer with wedges --> fall with tights and boots. i love pieces that can serve different purposes a
10370	I purchased this jumpsuit for christmas parties this year and have received so many compliments. it's a great fit and very comfortable. i especially love the pockets! very flattering.
10371	I honestly can't say enough wonderful things about this beautiful skirt. it is so soft and comfortable, very flowy and flattering, i have a smaller waist but wider hips, and this accentuates all of my best features! i highly recommend this skirt for any occasion! i wore it to my bridal shower and got soo many compliment and i really couldn't stop touching the material. what a wonderful addition to my closet!
10372	The burgundy and black dress is stunning on. beautiful cut and colors. i think i do need the petite however. the material is not as stretchy as other dresses, but the dress does keep its shape.
10373	"I bought this dress online because it looked interesting and on sale for $30 why not. i think it looks unassuming on the hanger but on it is fantastic. i am 5' 3"", 150 pounds, 34d and the 8 fit me perfectly. it accentuates the curves without revealing anything. will be perfect for fall/winter but am going to wear it to a wedding in june where the bride is a vintage loving person so i think with the right shoes and jewelry it will be perfect."
10374	Fits great and just as pictured. the material is very smooth and slinky.
10375	Perfect slimming fit. wore it to work and then on to a holiday party. received multiple compliments throughout the day and evening!
10376	The design is very flattering and holiday appropriate. but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used. although figure flattering, the zipper is so cheap that --it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress. and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they're asking for it. maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail
10377	I loved the fabric design. the fabric itself is a bit strange to the touch. i'm hoping it will soften with time. and the smell from the fabric is a bit strange. however, i love the fit and cut and pattern. i will gently hand wash it and hope for the best.
10378	It's a beautiful skirt. the color is vivid and the skirt is flattering.
10379	Got the wine color and love it! the design definitely is slimming! 5'1, 120lb, got  size 4.
10380	This sweater is gorgeous! the color is a true periwinkle which really attracted me to it. the bell sleeves are a nice change. i have very long arms and they fit perfectly. i could wear this sweater out.
10381	I love the skirt! the color is beautiful, but i didn't love the fabric. it's too delicate and not great for a mom with two busy boys.
10382	Love the high rise and stretch of this jean- i feel long and lean which is tough for a short curvy girl! i feel these run a little small for pilcro- i went up a size.
10383	This top is so pretty. the fabric is absolutely gorgeous and the lace on the collar and back add an elegant old world vibe to this beautiful blouse. it is very light and flowy and i can imagine it will be nice and cool for those hot summer days to come. i am rather large chested so it does look a little tent like from the side but that is not the case fron the front and honestly i really don't care because it is so comfortable and pretty. i know i will wear this top quite a bit this summer.
10384	I wanted this dress in wine for a holiday party. but it just has no life whatsoever. unlike prior reviewer, i found nothing to dislike about the fabric. the fabric is fine and the fit is fine. i'm sometimes an 8 and sometimes a 6; took this in an 8 and definitely would not size down. it's relatively close- and well-fitting, but the sleeves and neckline further ruined it for me. the sleeves are shapeless, long and baggy. the neckline is just blah. it needs to be neater, trimmer, more cut. the ruc
10385	This is interesting material- very heavy and smooth. it is fits great, i was able to size down. the color is a brown/copper and should match most things. overall, it is a great skirt for colder weather since it is thick material.
10386	I needed a modest dress with sleeves for a few events, and when this went on sale, i thought it might fit the bill. it does, and at under $30, it was a no-brainer flattering fit, attractive, tts, and the gathers over the middle hide my mommy tummy. i like that i can wear a normal bra with it, too. i can see what other reviewers are saying about the weird feel of the fabric, but it doesn't bother me. this dress will work well for evening and winter events and i'm glad it's in my closet.
10387	I love this dress. the fabric is creative...checked lace. the silhouette is figure flattering. work appropriate and can wear it for dinner with a change of shoes and jewelry.
10388	Love, love, love this dress! the color is a beautiful blue grey, and the peach embroidery has just a tiny bit of sparkle. can be dressed up or down.
10389	It was a little shorter than i expected i am 5'8 and 125 pounds. i ordered the extra small and it was a perfect fit aside from length. at 42 yrs old, i can't wear mid thigh dresses to work. hit hit me at the same length it hit the model in the picture.... even though she is 5'10. if you are 5'6 and below this is a beautiful dress
10390	"The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit, albeit unique, is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape, but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5'8"" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better."
10391	These are called jeans but they aren't exactly jean material. they are black with a nice stretch to the fabric. a bit tighter on the thighs than the flare jeans but the stretch to the fabric makes it work. i like these very much, a very slimming effect. mid rise- which looks very chic.highly recommend!
10392	Love the perfectly placed ruching. the red lace over black and elegant. fits like a glove. gives me great curves
10393	This beautiful blue sweater was exactly what i wanted!
10394	I liked the way the dress looked in the front, but the material in the back was knit and very clingy. i did not think it was flattering on me.
10395	I usually wear size 4 but the 2 was perfect, 4 would have definitely been loose. really nice zipper in the back, this skirt is thick and has a stiff/bouncy construction to it due to the neoprene which i was worried would make me look large but it is still soft enough that it doesn't do that. i usually have to get petite for retailer and this was no exception, the nonpetite goes beyond my knees awkwardly...  strangely enough, my only criticism for this is that the outer shell seems to get largish w
10396	As always these pilcro pants did not disappoint. i can always order a size 26 and know they will fit like a custom pant. i actually like the fit on me better than shown on the model. there is no crotch hang like in the photo. i need to wear heels with these because of the length but heels and flares are very slimming.
10397	Great dress for a party or a more conservative event.  love the style and fit.  a little hard to get on and off...
10398	"I was so surprised to find this in the sale. it is beautiful. light and airy while lined. the color is bright and fun. it is so comfortable. i ordered an xs based on reviews (this is my typical size in this type of style) and it fit great. i ordered the regular length even though i am only 5'4"". i am about 120#. will be an easy ""go to"" skirt to throw on for a casual look or can be dressed up. did i mention comfortable?"
10399	This dress worked well on me (not too curvy). it's fitted and enhances curves in a nice way. the patterns looked nice, too.
10400	This is a good skirt, although i think the fabric keeps it from being great. it fits well, has a good shape, and drapes nicely. the synthetic material is ok, and i'll keep it, but it may limit the use. i'll wear it to work, but probably not to nicer events.
10401	I love this sweater, especially the sleeves. i'm 5'2 and athletic so i don't' feel that it is the most flattering for my figure but i love it so much that i kept it!
10402	"I tried this dress on in the store. it looked frumpy. the ruching was not flattering. the fabric felt cheap. i think for the price there are plenty of other options for dresses than can give you a ""wow"" look. i'm 5'1"" 107lbs and the 0p fit fine."
10403	Cute, but very itchy! have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath!
10404	"The color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget - a very cheap polyester. on top of that - it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way - so you can bet, that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing. i've attached a picture of the ""hem"" below. on top of that - the ruching is awkward (as mentioned by another reviewers). all in all - kind of terrible."
10405	"Woah, these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash, the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3"" / 140 curvy. no, no, no!"
10406	This is a beautiful dress! blend of materials give it a great feel, the cut and style are very flattering. colors allow it to be carried over multiple seasons either on its own or layered for colder weather! very happy with this investment!
10407	
10408	"I am 5'3"" and the arms of this sweater run at least 2 inches past my finger tips. if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall, it just doesn't work. also, i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online. sigh."
10409	This sweater is ok. i love, love, love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect. i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring, but once it arrived, i knew i had to return. the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection. i like my sweaters more flowy. if you like fitted-style sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once. also, it's a bit itchy for me-but i'm rather sensitive and if i'd loved this on
10410	"Great summer skirt, can be dressed up or down. the band top is weird, but you don't have to style it as pictured. i may get the top hemmed down the road.  i have a 32 waist and got a size large."
10411	I love the style, but it didn't work for me. i ordered the r size. they were way too too long. i generally wear size 26, and the r length works with most retailer pants. with this particular pant, i could barely pull up the zipper. i'm not sure what happened bc i haven't gained any additional weight. i am 5'2, and 110 lbs. unfortunately, i had to return the pants. i think the design is for supermodels. maybe a petite size would have worked? the p was out of stock. good luck!
10412	Love this skirt. super soft and flowy. the red color is beautiful. i love the detailed raunching for the waist band. the length is perfect at my knee is i wear it empire waist style or below my knees if i wear on my hips.
10413	While being stylish. the dress is well made and comfortable.
10414	This skirt is so ladylike and light as air! the cherry red color is beautiful - just as pictured. i can imagine so many opportunities to wear this skirt. with a sweater and tights now, and maybe a striped tee and sandals in the spring. i'm sure i'll have this gorgeous classic in my wardrobe for a very long time to come!
10415	I tried the size small on at my regular store, and thought the subtle, sophisticated color and the embroidered pattern were beautiful, though the dress was clearly too long for me in the shoulders, neckline and armholes, and the lower hem.  i ordered the small petite online, hoping that it would fit perfectly, but the top of the dress fit the same as the regular size had in the store. the only difference was that the bottom hem was a little shorter and a better length for me.  i bought the dress
10416	Beautiful emerald green color in a lovely silk. i suggest one size down if you're small chested as the arm holes will fit more snugly.
10417	"Love this dress! i've been looking for a nice nursing friendly dress for a while and this one is perfect! its so soft and hangs nicely. its very versatile and can be worn for multiple seasons. i ordered a size small which fits nicely, but could have done an xs or small petite. (for reference, i am 5'2"", 118 lbs)."
10418	It does run a little small. my regular 2 fit but snug. the colors were drab and the material felt like straw. the lining is really silky and nice. just didn't work for me .
10419	This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on, but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length), it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length, which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.
10420	I am typically a 14-16 and the dress is true to size. (xl) i live that the embroidery runs the full length of the dress. i also like the shimmery side seam detail. the front cut near the shoulders is very flattering on. one minor issue is a gap in the bosom area due to button placement. however, i plan to add a snap t i fix. i often have this issue as i am large in that area. the length is flattering as well and provides great coverage in the rear. lightweight and flows nicely. the color is wond
10421	This dress is incredibly soft, comfortable, and essentially lined (i mean, look at all that intricate embroidery... your skin has no idea it is there). the colors are lovely (the embroidery is sort of a soft peachy cream lined with gold) and the dress is even prettier in person. the neckline is low, but not too revealing, and, though i normally avoid shirts without sleeves, the cut is flattering around my arms. the cut of the hem is also flattering. in some ways, the belt seems like an extra pie
10422	Fantastic price right now and very flattering!! cute and sexy dress that hugs but its forgiving!
10423	Very versatile dress.  runs a bit large i am 5 foot 2 (105 lbs) and ordered the xs petite and it fit perfectly!
10424	I fell in love with this dress online, but it just doesn't look as nice in person. first of all, it's huge. i usually take a 4-6 in dresses. i ordered a size 4 in this, and it was like a sack on me. i would have needed at least two sizes smaller. however, after seeing it in person, i didn't love it enough to order a smaller size to get a better fit.
10425	"I really like this dress. i tried it on in the store and i had to take it home with me. the print is fun and bright and interesting, without being over the top. the grommets give it a little bit of edgy balance to the sweet, flowy shape.  a note on the the fit: i am a 12/14 and the 12 fit well. it is a bit loose in some places, like the waist, but it certainly doesn't look like a maternity dress. i think the looseness is a good part of the overall look. i am high-waisted, and the waistline hit"
10426	These are very comfy and look great on! i would like to get a second pair in the lighter color.
10427	Super cute plaid top. i love the colors they are vibrant and go well with my fair complexion. it is a short top and would pair well with high waisted jeans or skirts.
10428	As with other maeve dresses, the fit is great. i love the empire waist with stud details. the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip. i'm not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything. when i first saw this online, i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online. however, only the smallest size had the great snake on the back
10429	This jacket is really cute! however, the mesh is really fragile. i've had the jacket for a month and noticed a huge tear down the back shoulder. it doesn't fit me tight so i'm not sure how it happened. every time i wear it i'm super paranoid about snagging it on something. like i mentioned before, the jacket is cute. it's lightweight and the design is unique. but if you want to get more than an occasional wearing out of this then don't bother. i'm hoping i can return it otherwise that's a lot of
10430	Love love love this blouse the cut outs at the top just add to it's elegance
10431	"I ordered the 00 p after trying on the regular 0, and that was better. it runs wide, the lining is true to size, but the overlay is loose. the colors are pretty, the design is nice, but i didn't love it as much as other ones.  likes: the studs add an edgier look to a almost dainty look (flow y sheer fabric). the cut is flattering if you get the right size (recommend one size down).  no big dislikes...why i would still recommend.  115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist... 00p"
10432	This is very cute in person. i love the colors, a tiny bit brighter in person. it is very feminine, with the ruffles, but with an edge. not too foo-foo. i tried no the regular size and it was a little short even on me, i would have to wear with higher rise pants, or show some belly... no petite on this one. the size 0 fit me at 115 lbs and 30dd chest. the material is light and airy, so great for warmer days. love it but in my wish list, didn't get it yet,...though the day it showed up at my loca
10433	"This was the dress i was most excited about in the new arrivals, but sadly it didn't live up to expectations. unlike the first two product photos, the dress is baggy and empire waisted, and the black trim is the thin one shown in the last two product photos. the dress is slip on with no zipper or tie, and on me there were about 4+ inches to spare at the waist. all in all it felt sloppy, such a shame as i would have loved the original design online.  anyhow, i wanted to share photos of the real"
10434	I just love these! i ordered these in both the lighter and darker denim in my usual size 28. they fit just right, just like my other pilcro jeans. i'm only 5' and the petite version was not available so i will have to get them altered but that's typical. i love the wash in each of them and the distressing is good, not over-the-top. i'm so glad i got these! and the sale price was a bonus!
10435	"I received many compliments on this dress. for a maeve dress it did run large. i normally take a 4 or 6 in maeve but with this dress i bought the size 2 and it fits perfect. i am 5' 2"" and 120 lbs. i have a little belly and this dress hides it well. beautiful colors and nice shape. it also hits at my knee so it is perfect for work."
10436	I saw this dress and fell in love right away! this is right up my alley, super comfy, perfect fit and love the stud detail. can't wait to wear!
10437	I found this top really flattering on. i originally ordered a 6 and found it a little too big. the 4 fit perfectly, it falls around your belly button area so a little of your stomach will show. it has a flattering scoop neckline and the ruffles give it that extra flare. very light weight for the summer, colors are brighter/better in person.
10438	I originally bought this jacket in a medium, but the sleeves were a bit long and overall fit a little big. i decided to exchange for a small and i am so glad i did!! this jacket feels great and the sleeves hit at just the right spot in the small size. i normally wear a 6.
10439	Very cute and would transition well season to season with different boots/booties.  didn't lay well on chest for me.  returned it.
10440	This was a very odd fitting top. i should have read the description more closely. the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places.
10441	"I ordered this coat as it was on sale but it was so nice it would have been worth full price. i am 5 feet 1"" and 110 pounds - i ordered a 4 petite as i like jackets a little larger for a sweater underneath but i could have used the 2 petite as well. this coat is heavy - so also very warm. it is a little shorter than on the model. the colors are more vivid the blue is a denim wash blue not navy blue - it fits fabulously and the quality is great. i wore it to dinner with a navy turtleneck and must"
10442	I purchased this dress for a special occasion and am delighted it's exactly what i was hoping for. everything from the way it fits to the way it feels is perfect. i highly recommend it!
10443	This top is lovely to look at and to wear... one to reach for frequently
10444	Run to purchase this jacket. i am in love. it surpassed my wildest expectations when it arrived. beautiful coloration, comfortable fit, fantastic fabric and gorgeous collar. i am so glad that i ordered it. please use this exact same design and offer this same jacket in other colors and patterns. i can't say enough good things about this item.
10445	I just received the acacia swing tank and when i pulled it out, i felt like it was christmas day all over. it hangs nicely and felt luxurious on my skin. even my husband was dazzled. the detailing of the flowers is delicate and feminine. the cutaway gives you a sexy, casual chic appearance that you can dress up or down. i can't wait to unveil this new piece at work.
10446	
10447	This was really billowy but not in a good way. i had to return it. looks great in the photo but not so much in person.
10448	Soft and romantic. i love it! just like pictured and i wear a cami under. dress up or down
10449	Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn't. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn't have enough shape. had to send it back.
10450	It is one of my favorites from retailer. i received so many compliments while wearing it! i usually wear a 6 but i sized down to a 4 and still had plenty of room.
10451	"Fell in love with these instantly in the dressing room. it was more than i wanted to spend but i don't regret it. quality is great, denim is just the right thickness, i love the wash... will be wearing these a lot. just like my other pilcros!  i'm 5'8"" 125 lbs. size 28 fits perfect and the length is just right."
10452	I'm so disappointed with the fit of this top. it is extremely short, even for my 5'2 frame. sizing up will not fix the length. too bad, because the shirt is cute.
10453	This was a holiday splurge and combined with a sale discount, it was a good price. i love this coat. i agree with some of the shapelessness in the back. but it's not a deal breaker for me. the overall cuteness won me over.
10454	I love the look of this jacket. it's incredibly soft and fits tts. i love how it's a little different and fun. however, it's already pilling after 3 wears. probably have gotten a total of 15 hours of wear out of it. i am so disappointed. for this price point, i would have expected better quality.
10455	This is a beautiful, well made jacket. also, it's very cozy and warm. unfortunately for me, it was too short and wide. i ordered the petite, but it was still too wide which also made it look too short. not flattering for my small frame.
10456	"Great quality coat! very pretty colors and love the sleeves! i would have given 5 stars, but like other reviewers stated, this coat does she'd. best not to wear black. it is a slight ""swing"" style coat, so it's not fitted at the waist and hips, but very stylish. i found it best to size down. i'm 5'4 118lb, but i'm large chested (32dd) i usually wear a size 6 coat or blazer so it fits my chest, but the six was too big. the size 4 fit great across my chest and still room for a sweater!"
10457	I love this shirt. tried in on in stores. i'm typically a medium across the board. i'm 5'6, 137lbs, 34d. i went for the size 6 figuring the 4 would be too small. the 6 fit... but it's short like everyone else said. not crop top short but definitely raise your arms and stomach is exposed short. i didn't buy it for the $50 price tag because of the shortness. but now that it's 30% i might spring for it, regardless of the weird cut. it's super cute otherwise!
10458	"I disagree with the other reviews...the colors on this dress are great. bright against the black and the studs are super cute. and the ties at the cuff are a cute touch. fun dress. i think it's as fitted or not as you want. drives me crazy when people get hung up on their ""size"" to judge clothes. go up or down if it doesn't fit the way you want. i like it to flow a little so i sized accordingly."
10459	These are way oversized! i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large. wasted money on shipping. won't do that again:(
10460	I received this jacket in an 8. fits great with room . i am a 34dd chest for reference as i was not sure if i needed a 10, but the 8 is perfect. see my pictures as i feel the website photos are more bright as the actual jacket is more muted. buttons are very nice but the pocket flaps hit right at the boob area so it my bother some . very high quality, lined and will look great over some retailer dresses in the same color way i purchased last year. depending on the season this jacket would do fine
10461	Disappointing, back is yellowish and looks strange. the front view is cute but doesn't match the fabric on the back at all. can't imagine why you would do that?
10462	"I love these jeans. perfect amount of stretch, perfect color, perfect weekend.   i bought two sizes smaller than normal.  a little snug when they come out of the dryer, but within an hour they are the perfect fit."
10463	The color of this dress is amazing! even though it's not lined, the fabric looks and feels like silk charmeuse and is so light and comfy on your skin. more of a maxi than a midi on me; i'm considering shortening it. elegant and breezy at the same time - love it!
10464	When i saw this blouse online i thought it was so cute! i love the floral detail. unfortunately it looks much cuter online than it does in person. it has no shape so it is not flattering to the figure. it might look better tucked in or partially tucked in as shown in the picture, but it did not look good completely tucked out. i was also not a fan of the fabric. in the picture the fabric looks dressier than it is. the front is more polyester and is a little dressier, but not what i envisioned. t
10465	"Beautiful, feminine, flowy dress. love the brass button detail at neckline and around waist-gives the otherwise delicate dress a pop of ""edge"". had to detach the slip to get it on, but glad it is included with the dress. i purchased the small and fits like a glove (5'8"", 135lbs, 34d). can't wait to wear it!!"
10466	I bought this for my girlfriend with the hope that my presumptive intuition about her style preferences and the fit itself would prove successful. fortunately she loves it and looks amazing in it!  the colors are vibrant and the unique texture really lends itself toward a clothing item that is special- even for retailer.  recommend it highly!
10467	The snake and the studs, they make the dress. sadly, the snake is hard to find, as mentioned in another review. this dress also runs large, i'm usually a 12 and went down to 10. the images are misleading too. two pics show a small, fitted look, and the other two show a full, swing look. i'm trying to make this work but it may have to go.
10468	"I originally purchased these in a size 27 and they were big. i returned them and got a size 26, and they did stretch out after wearing them once - to the point where i could probably have gone done to a size 25. the cut, color, fabric and distressing are great. i am 5'3"" and the pants are a tad too long for me to wear them with ankle booties without looking odd. overall, i love these jeans and wear them a lot!"
10469	Please be awate that although this blouse is beautiful and the color is gorgeous--it is completely sheer!!! it just doesn't match up with the price point,
10470	The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.
10471	I loved this dress on the hanger and loved it more when i tried it on. i am usually an 8, but purchased the 6 in this dress. i preferred the empire waist to be more fitted which the 6 provided. you can decide which look you prefer. both looked good. i just wanted a less baggy look. as one reviewer mentioned, the print is cut different on all of the dresses. i think the colors pictured online are accurate. regarding the snake on the fabric, i have several snakes on my dress, but not on the back a
10472	This is a very pretty, particularly youthful dress.  but, do be forewarned, it is gigantic.  size down even if you never do, and get a petite if you are even a little short.  i didn't size down enough and it was both wide and long -- it looked ridiculous.  i am petite, and the hem went way below my knees (and the dress was considerably longer than the slip).
10473	I probably have 10 pairs of pilcro jeans and pants and most of the jeans are the skinny fit. i wanted something that wasn't a skinny fit so i thought i would try these straight fit jeans thinking they would be skinny but they also wouldn't be loose. just got them today and when i tried them on they were tighter then the skinny jeans i just took off. i guess i agree with the other reviewers that they fit like a glove. so if that's what you're looking for these will be great.
10474	Love this dress! light and breezy, but i'm wearing it with tights and a jacket for a winter look.
10475	I'm anxious to wear this dress with boots. i love the colors and print. perfect for work and evenings out.
10476	"I bought this online because i love the print on the dress and i was not disappointed. it is gorgeous! the waist on the dress is much looser than in the picture, but i am fine with that. i am 5'9"" and the dress length is accurate as shown in the picture."
10477	This is a great staple piece for your closet. i do agree that it runs large. i am usually a small and ordered this in an xsmall and that was perfect for the billowy-ness of the top. i have a long torso and arms, so going with an xsmall made the arms slightly short on me. i do not see this as an issue as i just pull them up to 3/4 length on my arm (the sleeves are elastic so this is possible). i receive compliments every time i wear this top. it is beautiful and comfortable. i definitely recommen
10478	Beautiful blouse, very flattering! if you run larger in the bust you might want to select one size larger than you usually wear.
10479	Not bad- basic, simple, versatile. i wore untucked with skinny black pants. comfy too. cotton knit like materials.
10480	I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.
10481	I ordered this when i first saw it on line but it was backordered. it just arrived today and i am so very happy with it. so feminine, kind of vintage yet modern. the epitome of the retailer aesthetic. i typically wear a 0p ( 32 a -26-35: 5 ft 2 in) in tracy reese and the 0p is perfect. i gave a 4 for quality only because it is polyester, (however that also keeps the price down). it seems that every summer plenty by tracy reese comes out with a dress that becomes my go -to favorite and this year is
10482	
10483	Perfect summer dress: feminine, cool, with just the right flow. hides the bad, and has a nice shape.
10484	I ordered xs petite. the base of the neck was itchy... if you wear a turtle neck sweater inside, it should be fine. the other parts were very soft.
10485	I wanted this immediately after seeing it in the catalog. i couldn't wait for it to get to my store so i ordered it and it did not disappoint! it is extremely flattering on my hourglass figure. the pattern and colors are amazing. the unlined lower half does not bother me. i will be wearing this with a denim jacket, light sweater, wedges, then booties in the fall! i fell like this dress will be able to be worn for years to come.
10486	Bought this for a summer wedding, it fit great and i got a lot of compliments!
10487	I like the shirtsleeves for south florida and the material. the design is great too. hits high up on my waist which i like. i ordered the black, but had to send it back as the medium was too big. i usually take a medium, but the small fits perfect. like white a lot and ordered the gold too.
10488	I love the style of this top. hand washed before wearing and it looks like a rag before i even got to wear it. very disappointed since i thought it would be a very practical tank.
10489	I so wanted to love the striped peplum top, however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top. not flattering in the least for a d-dd cup. will be returning. i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen :)
10490	Love it!! it does run big so i had to return for smaller size. fabric is nice very true to picture
10491	"I saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had 1 more left in my size! it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my 27"" inches perfectly with no real give- so keep that in mind. the top does seem a little blousey, which i typically avoid (34d already) but this was still super flattering. overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on- one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it!"
10492	I ordered this online and was completely underwhelmed in person. the pattern didn't pop at all and the fit was just ok. it kind of bunched weird in the breast area. i usually love plenty but this is a return.
10493	This was my first dress purchase this year, quite late. i've been disappointed with a lot of polyester/rayon/viscose dresses so far. if it's 100% silk or cotton, it's quite expensive. this dress meets all my tick marks: no synthetic, beautiful pattern, well-made, flattering to the figure. i have a silk slip so the absence of lining was not an issue for me. fits true to my petite sizing. it's a very easy to wear dress, no tugging with straps or a belt. it's slimming and skims the figure properly.
10494	These jeans fit like a glove while being flatteringly stretchy. i am 5ft 7in, 125 lbs and i have a size 26. these are my second pair of ag stevie ankle jeans and i can't wait to get more. they are a beautiful deep/dark blue. love them!!
10495	Not being into bright neon colors, i love this top! the fit is true to size and helps to hide my tummy. it's super cute and very flattering.
10496	I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size, however, it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump, this is a good choice. for others who are not, it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.
10497	I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top, which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well, made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress, flowing and cool.
10498	I bought this dress in a store, and it suits the body better than on the picture. the pattern is exquisite and beautiful, i receive compliments every time i wear it. it is made of silk, which is a preferred alternative to polyester. but as other reviewers mentioned, it needs a slip, and for an expensive dress it should come with one, or should be fully lined. it is only lined on top. the peep hole is deep, but on my body, it doesn't gap much (i'm 5'7'' 142 lbs). a keeper for me for its beauty!
10499	Great quality top. i do wish it fit me...i'm really long waisted and this top was too short. had to return
10500	It's very pretty. i purchased mine in the floral. romantic floral. the peplum is true to photos. it isn't short as many are. the print is gorgeous and the fabric is soft and comfortable and the styling is perfect
10501	There were just too many pleats to this thing. it was not flattering. it looks fantastic on this model but not on me. oh well.
10502	Ag is my go-to brand for comfortable, high quality jeans. these fit the bill!
10503	I love everything about this dress, but the bust area. the bottom is so light and flowey with the pleating. makes you want to twirl. the color is light but not as light as the photo. it does not wash me out. the problem is the bust. it has pleats that billow out near the armpit area, making you look top heavy. the bottom is slimming, the top make you look buxom. the v neck is also higher than i would like, which again adds to the fullness of the chest area. i am still debating keeping this or re
10504	I love this dress! the colors are so pretty and the fit is very flattering.
10505	"This wasn't for me. i have a short neck and am 5.3"". the length was fine on the one i tried on, but other proportions were off. it was too big around, in the middle, yet tighter at the bottom. on me, this made it resemble a large bag. the neckline stood up on mine. even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model, it still felt like a whiplash collar (coming up over my chin). i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft."
10506	"I finally ordered this after looking at it many times, had to order the 00p as they were out of all other petite sizes, and to my surprise, it totally fits me! why i put larger. both colors are equally nice, but due to my pale skin (and only petite available) i ordered the ""yellow"" one (brighter colors). cut is flattering, love the pleat detail in the skirt, the 00p fit my 30dd chest, and 26.5 inch waist. the length is perfect, above the knee in front and lower in the back. good choice..."
10507	I was urged to try this on by my usual stylist as she thought it would look nice with shorts i purchased or jeans or pencil skirt i own (she knows a lot of what i own). it is truly pretty love the embroidered cut outs makes the tank look stylish. the cut is also flattering, though i think i'll have to wear a strapless bra. color is also warm enough to work on pale skin like me or a golden tan. i purchased the 0 regulr, tried on petite but i found it was short and flared too much. i am 115 lbs 30
10508	"This dress is absolutely gorgeous. the fabric is light and comfortable. the colors are even more vibrant in person. it has a keyhole opening in front, which might not be for everyone, but which i really liked. the only things i would caution buyers about, is that it is not lined, and for shorter buyers (i'm 5' 3"") it runs a bit long, so if you can pick up the petite, that might mean a better fit."
10509	The print on the fabric of this dress is stunning. it is lighter weight than i anticipated, and the photo didn't show the keyhole opening in the front (which i like but may not be for everyone). i am pear shaped and on the tall side, so the shape works nicely on me, not too snug in the middle or rear. not sure about someone not as tall or more busty. i typically wear a larger size on the bottom than the top, so i ordered in the larger size which fit well.
10510	
10511	This dress is easy to wear, lined and feels like it could be a wonderful summer staple. i love that it's so colorful. but for some reason, the pops of color on the white background did not look great on my very pale skin. i'm sure on someone else this will be beautiful. i also thought it ran just slightly large in the bust (although, to be fair, i am small-chested).
10512	"I love this top!! fits perfectly, and not too long. i'm 5'4"", 112 lbs and a 32dd and the small fits like a gem.not too fitted, but not boxy. i like that it covers my waist, but isn't too long, either. i may order another one i love it so much!"
10513	
10514	Just not cute. i don't know how else to describe this top. i am a 34dd and ordered a large. it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am. i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn't in store so i returned.
10515	This is a cute top. not perfectly made, a little boxy, but also not a crop top on me (5'5). it looks cute with high waisted jeans.
10516	"I saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it. when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes - my regular and one size larger. when i got them, i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect! beautiful pattern and material. light and airy. sexy with the low-cut ""keyhole."" i am sooo happy with my purchase."
10517	I love the design of this top - short and swingy, with a cute mock turtleneck and interesting textured pattern. definitely runs large - if you're between sizes, definitely go for the smaller one. it also has pretty large armholes, so you can kind of see your bra from the side.
10518	I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.
10519	The product looked more or less as expected, but the fabric felt very cheap. not the quality i would expect from retailer. the shirt is also very short, which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of.
10520	I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however, not only are the armholes are too large, the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes, it becomes a crop top, not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work, but alas, it went back.
10521	"One of my favorite dresses in retailer! floral prints caught my eye at the first sight, so i had been desperate to have it! it looks pale on picture, but in reality, it is brighter than you imagine it would be.  along with soft, floral, pretty color, i like the design of skirt.  compared to the front, length is longer on the back.  it fringes nicely, so it looks elegant when i walk. and the last thing i'd like to point out... because of the textile, it is quite easy to fold into appr"
10522	"The delicate print and coloring are stunning. i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress.  the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch, i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nice.  this is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top. i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines"
10523	I love ag stevie jeans but these are my favorite. super soft with just the right amount of stretch. they keep their fit and don't stretch out. the very dark wash makes them extremely flattering. i'm petite and a bit curvy and these are extremely comfortable.
10524	The dress is just perfect. it's fits true to size and the colors are as pictured. also, a bonus, it travels well - despite having so many pleats it folds nicely and can be worn right out of the bag. very happy i got it while on sale.
10525	"I bought this dress for an upcoming bridal shower i am attending. it fits great, is flattering, and i can also wear it to work since it is long enough.  overall it was a great purchase!"
10526	"I am 5'10"" 150lbs and size 8 fits me perfectly.  the print is lovely and the fabric has a nice flow to it.  at this price point the dress should have a lining."
10527	"Love this, but it is not a true white. it's slightly ivory, winter white. please be accurate with color descriptions! it's extremely frustrating when online retailers don't describe colors accurately. it can be hard to see subtle color differences in photos (especially with the color white) due to lighting of the shot. we rely on descriptions when ordering online. it's not difficult to do, really it's not.  that said, i didn't have any armhole trouble as others did. they were sized just right,"
10528	"It was just too big in the regular size and too short in petite.  the proportion was off.  i bought a similar sweater last year in a blue color that i wore constantly and was hoping this would be like it. i think if you are very tall you might pull this off. i'm 5,4"" and even the extra small regular hung below my booty."
10529	I had sized down because i'm usually a petite, but didn't have the option for petite here, and it was still too big. a petite or an additional size down could have helped the fit, but in the end the style wasn't what i was going for. the dress has a little more texture going on than what is revealed in the photo here on the site -- i thought it was a luxurious brocade fabric, but the shininess actually comes from silky threads on a mesh-ish overlay. it's a lovely, quality dress, and the color is
10530	"I am a sweater girl, so i was really looking forward to this cozy-looking piece. like other reviewers, i found the fit to be very strange and not as pictured. i am 5'1"" and 107 lbs and typically wear xxsp or xsp. i ordered this in the xxsp because of the loose fit. it did not fit like the model at all. the sleeves were shorter and stuck out oddly. the length was not as long as pictured, but it would have been fine for me had the sweater not also been as wide as it was long. others suggested sizi"
10531	The design is stunning, the color is universally super-flattering. it's a lovely top. so much so that i tried it on even though it was pricey. but the armholes are huge. you can see it on the model, who is definitely not wearing a bra. on me, there was a lot of side bra exposure. if they'd had smaller sizes at the berkeley store, i would've given them a shot, but my true size was a really poor fit.
10532	There is simply no way to wear a bra with this top. that being said, the cotton is substantive and crisp, the embroidery striking, the coral color bright and summery. it hits me exactly where my hips begin to broaden, which i honestly kind of hate, but the top is so lovely no one's going to be assessing your hips. if you have narrow hips and perky breasts, though, what a perfect summer top (although, i suppose if those are your features every top is perfect!)
10533	The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright, but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.
10534	I know you've heard it before, but this dress is so much more beautiful in person! i'm petite, usually size 4 but busty, so i tried the 4 and the 6 in the store. the 4 fit perfectly except it was a bit snug at the bust so the the slit pulled open, revealing a bit more cleavage than i wanted. the 6 fit perfectly through the bust, and although it was a bit loose through the body, the cut was still very flattering. i also tried the 6p, which fit but i preferred the longer length of the regular 6.
10535	This is the 4th pair of ag stevie jeans i have bought from retailer. the petite sizing fit me great (i'm 5'1 and 112 lbs) the quality is fabulous and worth the price. i have 2 denim, 1 white, and just purchased these dark wave. i went to the ag store and they do not carry petities. this jean is made exclusively for retailer. love them!
10536	"Just wanted to let readers know that the dress doesn't flare out at the bottom like it shows on the model. for me, that's a good thing. it definitely sways and swishes, but doesn't flare out. you definitely have to wear a slip with it, not because it's see-through at all (it's not), but because of the static.   also, this is the perfect dress for belt-lovers."
10537	"This dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites! (i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering...so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well!) i ordered in the 2p. i am 5'4"" about 120#. it fits beautifully...even though it's a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p (it is no longer available though). but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is"
10538	Very versatile tank.....i will wear it with slacks, skirts, culottes, jeans. it is soft; and the pattern is more noticeable than in the picture. i ordered the white; and i may order the black too. i am 5'4'', 130 lbs. ordered in small. the armholes are perfect - no gap at all.
10539	I really like this dress. it does not bother me that it is not lined. i feel very feminine wearing it. i plan to get a shrug to wear with it.
10540	This dress is to die for.  the picture doesn't do it justice. so pretty and dainty.  perfect dress for a wedding.
10541	This dress is gorgeous. it is better in person than online. i love the detail of the pleats and the waist. it is light weight and perfectly lines and a beautiful dress for twirling with a martini in hand. in fact, my sister tried to steal it from during a recent trip to europe. it is that adorable and flattering - highly recommend!
10542	This top is so pretty, even better in person. it's made really well and i love that it's washable. i did have some initial reservations with the fit. i'm petite and small chested so i typically like to wear a bra to get a bit of extra 'help'. but with the way this top is cut, swingy and slightly bell shaped, i found that wearing a bra, even one with light foam cups (not even pushup), was making the shape of the top look really weird. once i took off the bra, the top actually looked great. i got
10543	I loved everything about this shirt except the harm holes are oddly large. i tried on a medium and the arm holes were very large so i thought a small would fit better but it didn't, the fabric is beautiful and the diamond pattern looks amazing up close but i decided to return the top because the arm holes just stuck out so awkwardly.
10544	You just can't go wrong with a perfect white top. i'm usually xs or s and got this top in xs & the fit is perfect. the bottom is a very subtle bubble hem that you can't really see in the picture. the top is boxy but not too overwhelming since the proportions are just right. thesis a great transitional top that will go with skinny jeans, pencil skirts or even a pair of utility pants. it can easily be dressed up or down.
10545	The fabric and cut of the dress is beautiful.  i am writing a review so i can share my experience regarding size. i ordered the dress in size 2, my normal size for this designer. it fit ok but was a little large in the bust area. for reference, i am a 34 a. i i returned it and ordered a size 0, which fits perfectly.
10546	"I love, love, love this top! the color is beautiful, a pinkish-orange, about exactly how it looks online. it is soft and light weight for summers. it does run a little big, i debated between a 0 and a 2 and ended up with a 2, i'm almost 5'7"" and 130lbs for reference. it wings out on the sides at first, once i steamed it at home and relaxed the fabric a bit it draped nicely, so don't let that turn you off from it when trying it on! part of the design is cut out through out as a warning,"
10547	These jeans are very comfortable, with the higher waist. they have a slight stretch and keep their shape. i also like that the inside is a darker color, which looks good when rolled up.
10548	I love this tank top. i was looking for a mockneck tank for a while, and this totally fit the bill. i wear it to work and out, and feel great in it.
10549	Beautiful top marred only by the armholes. i tried a small and a medium but alas, my bra showed under the arms. i my be overly endowed for this top, but the way it cuts, you would have to be braless to wear it. not for me, but wish it worked. it is really pretty.
10550	"I am 5' 4"", a size 8-10 (size 29/30), and my figure is apple-ish. i can't pull off peplum tops because they are too tight for my shape and they flare out at an unflattering spot. all of those ""rules"" go out the window with this tankini.  first, swimsuits are supposed to be tight, so that problem is eliminated right away. second, the flare-out is perfect for women that want to hide their tummies. i don't like how swimsuits are generally tight in the tummy - that's the area that i'd like to hide t"
10551	"My favorite pair of ags. i normally wear sz26 but i have awkward proportions when it comes to finding jeans that are actually ""ankle"" length on me. i orders these in a petite and went a size up to be safe. it doesn't seem like they've stretch out any and they fit exactly how i want. i love the dark wash bc they can be both dressed up and down."
10552	"I see other reviewers are like me. we are wondering why antho has so many waistless, big, flowy tops! please! more tops with a defined waist! please! i love this top. it's a gorgeous color and a lot of work to it, very retro antho, not just a t-shirt like so many are these days. to my delight, it runs large. i usually wear a 14 or 16, but the store had a 12 in the sale room, and not only did it fit, but i plan to have my seamstress taper the waistline and cut off the ""wings"" that flare off on t"
10553	I have been searching my entire marriage -- 11 years -- for the perfect christmas and valentine's day dress. it had to be red, it had to be the right red, and it had to be my style. there were several i saw over the years that were either too burgundy or too matronly. when i saw this dress, i knew my 11-year search was over! this is the most beautiful and elegant, red, special-occasion dress i have ever seen! i cannot wait to wear it for christmas! i think retailer should have reordered thi
10554	"Ag jeans are the only brand that fit my body type. for reference, i'm 5'4"", short-waisted with larger athletic thighs, smaller waist, bigger behind (or pear-shaped) and shorter legs. this is first time i didn't have to cut off several inches in length, though i may need to hem a few inches as these jeans hit right below ankle (not above like model photo). i usually wear a 29 in ag, but went up one size based on other reviewers comments. ag jeans are worth the price: great quality and made in the"
10555	I love this top! it's so hard for me to find conservative, comfortable and yet not mom-isn swimsuits. this top is amazing. it's comfortable and soft and great quality. i'm excited to use this suit this season!
10556	Very poorly made- wide and short, very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton, but it felt very synthetic.
10557	"I loved the pattern, color and mock turtleneck style of this top, but it was just too short on me. i purchased the xs in the ivory color (i am 5'5"", 32d, 110 lbs for reference). i had planned to layer this under jackets for work, but every time i raised my arms, you could see my stomach. i would not have felt comfortable wearing it to work because of this. the fit was slightly boxy also, and it was not flattering when i tucked it into a skirt because the boxy shape caused the shirt to bunch up s"
10558	"I purchased this dress in ""yellow"" in a size 8 and 10 since i'm between sizes, and the 8 fits like a dream. i love this dress. it's a nice length, hitting just below my knees, and i can pull off strappy sandals as well as wedge heels and it all looks great. i also like that the top is situated so that i can wear a regular bra with it. i was concerned that the pleats would look tacky in person, but they give the dress a nice amount of movement and swing. highly recommend!"
10559	So much prettier in person! beautiful colors matched together! so light and relaxing! love at first sight!
10560	"As always, these ag stevies are perfect. i was worried they would run small, but they are true to size on me. i'm about 5'2"" and ordered the petite length and the length looks like the model on me. just above the ankles."
10561	Very pretty and a nice fit. lighter weight than i expected at this price but as long as it holds up i'll be happy.
10562	This dress is very pretty colorwise, but the fit did not work for me. i could see this working on girls with narrow hips, but it didn't flatter my narrow waist/wide hip frame.
10563	Agree with other reviewers that the sweater might swallow you up unless you are tall. it's soft (not itchy), well made, comfy and stylish. i want it to get cold out so i can wear it!
10564	Beautiful and high quality. unfortunately it made me look top-heavy. i am a 36dd .
10565	I wanted to love this so much that i ordered in both a mp and sp. both have gone back. i'm petite and curvy - particularly on top. i wear petites 90% of the time. this didn't fit like a petite - it was cut like full size in every way - particularly the arm holes and length. when the mp didn't fit (i always start trying on in the larger size), i thought - well surely the small will be better. i considered keeping because i would wear it with jackets over it, then decided that was crazy. disappoin
10566	Thought i would love this product, but i had to return it. the fabric and design were very nice but the length was very short and the neck too tight. i ordered a xxsp which is usually the size i get. if i had known i would have ordered a regular xxs. not sure if this would have solved the problem. might be worth going to the store to try.
10567	Great dress. bit see through on the skirt. need to wear slip with it.
10568	I bought the holly color which appears almost granite/slate color in natural light. overall, great transitional sweater piece for fall. i'm considering exchanging it for an xs since the s seems a bit large. comfy/cozy yet breathable.
10569	Great job from the fabricators in creating such a gorgeous print on light-as-air silk! i'm so happy with the dress and can stare at it for hours, that's how pretty it is. the fit is perfect on me and disguised my figure flaws since it's an a-line skirt that doesn't cling. yes, the skirt is sheer and unlined and for the price a slip should have been included. fortunately i own a silky half slip that complements nicely. i'm a top heavy 36dd, large rib cage, 140# with a square waist and no hips and
10570	I love tracy reese designs because they are so feminine and figure flattering. this dress almost hits the target, it's just a bit off on the bodice, especially at the back and sides. the pleating balloons out too much. i'm sure a little tailoring will fix this, it's up to the buyer if that's worth the money to do it. for myself, i'm just wearing a thin cropped cardi to hide the billow. since petite was sold out, i took a regular size 8 which is the smaller of my size range. the length makes this
10571	I love this top so much that i ordered it in second color. it is shorter but still works with skirts and pants. the material is a fun texture. i didn't have any problems with the arm holes, but this may be due to being less full in the bust area.
10572	Love this sweater! i purchased both the green and gray versions and will wear them constantly this winter. although some reviews were critical of the feel of the yarn, i do not find this to be a problem... so happy with these products! for reference to size, i bought the m and am 5'11... the sweater hits me exactly where it does on the model.
10573	Love the fit, i purchased a medium,and like the room it gives, not snug against my body. the waistline cut is my favorite. purchased three colors, black, white and mustard. all are very flattering for my age (60) and i wear with my skinny jeans!
10574	This is a chunky, boxy sweater. it runs big. the pictures don't really show how over sized the cowl neck is. i love it and think it looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. but the over-sized shape might not work with every body type.
10575	This is such a flattering, easy to wear dress! i am a size 6 with a 32g bust, and this dress fits me perfectly. so if you're busty, this should work for you too. soft, flowy, feminine. looking forward to warm weather!
10576	Absolutely adore the simplicity and style of this dress. dress is quite flowy, the fabric under the pleats is very soft making is quite comfortable.
10577	Swimsuit shopping can be the worst. it's difficult to find bathing suits that fit well and are flattering. this swim top is a winner. the straps are comfortable, and the scoop in the front was not too low for a 36d cup. the best part is the higher back! a lot of swimwear dips in the back, but this does not (read: eliminates the dreaded back fat). my only concern was that it isn't super supportive for larger busts, but i'm keeping it because i love the straps and how it flatters overall. this wou
10578	This dress has a marilyn feel to it, felt like a dream
10579	Just bought this for easter and it fits beautifully! not only is the cut very flattering, but the colors and fabric are perfect for spring!
10580	The cut of this dress is designed for any figure! the back hem sweeps as you walk, and the pleats prevent the material clinging to places you want to downplay, such as bulges. even flat chested women can look curvy and lovely in this dress. only downside, if any, is the lavender coloring which doesn't do much for impact if you are pale skinned and fair. i'm blonde, and while i got lots of compliments on the becoming flow of the dress, even i can see it doesn't say wow because i kind of fade away
10581	"I am a huge fan of ag stevie ankles and own at least a dozen pair. i am 5'4"", so this style is perfect for me. this particular wash is a fantastic and flattering fit. it hits right above my ankle and fits beautifully through the hips and legs. i am going to buy a 2nd pair as i know i will be wearing these all the time!"
10582	"This is the second of the new dress batch i have purchased and it is lovely. this catalog shot does not do it justice.  the colors are brighter, but not neon, lots of indigo and coral. there is a tad of yellow? the bodice makes my aa size look much ""more."" the bodice fits me perfectly as the top pleating is flat. the v neck is just right - not too low, and the back is even prettier.  the dress just fell gracefully out of the package without a wrinkle and without a mussed pleat! that was a sh"

10584	This top is really comfortable but dressy enough for a business/casual office. the fit is nice and loose without making you look larger than you are. i get a lot of compliments every time i wear this.
10585	I love this dress! it is perfect for a wedding, brunch with friends, or even work. it is beautifully made and is comfortable. i have it in the yellow colorway, but i am tempted to go back and purchase it in the purple colorway as well.
10586	This dress is much prettier in person! colors are more vibrant and don't need to iron!!! the neckline was too low for me, so wore a light purple cami underneath which matched the purplish shade of the dress! perfect!!!
10587	These are a perfect staple piece: you can dress them up or down, and they're insanely comfortable! even if you hold a lot of your weight in your butt and thighs like i do, i feel like these pants do such a nice job of being form-fitting and flattering without squeezing the life out of you. i have always loved any and all retailer pants in this style, because they just fit so well and last a really long time. i will continue to buy these for many, many years!
10588	Love the color of this- a rich, dark green- it is super cozy and perfect to throw a long sleeved shirt under- it is roomy, not fitted. i ordered a small, then thought i should have ordered an xs,- so then i ordered an xs as well. i go between xs and small, but because this is not fitted, the xs is perfect. material is nice- soft and super cozy.
10589	"The colors (including the deep blue in the background) are as vibrant and harmonious in person as you would hope, it looks like an oil pastel drawing! the print itself is very well done, i'm so picky about the quality and resolution but even up close every part is beautiful.   the cut is great, it doesn't show too much of the armpit, the straps and sides cover a normal bra, and the neckline just shows the collarbones.  the feel is very light and floaty; some sites mislabel the material but t"
10590	This is a lovely dress that i would consider to purchase if the dress is lined and the key hole is not deep. tts
10591	The arm holes are a little large but not to a point i can not deal with them! it hits just at the right place on my body and is very flattering. i love the print and it is going to be a staple with jackets and alone!!
10592	I'm a slightly pear shaped girl. a c chest with size 14 hips. the dress fit great around my waist and would have been perfect except the space in the chest area was too big. it looked odd on me with all the extra fluff in the chest. fabric is nice and flowy. the dress is lined.
10593	I wasn't sure what to expect when i ordered this but when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised that it's by postmark and has an interesting cut. i ordered the xl in the hope that it would be oversized and slouchy. it is that and more! the lightweight, sweater like material is truly perfect for the transition to spring. i look forward to wearing it tomorrow!
10594	My local retailer had one of these skirts in store, presumably a return. i was so excited when i found out that it was in my size! i'm 5'7 and usually a 2 or 4 at retailer and bought the 2 for reference. the skirt is made of a heavy fabric and the pockets are lined with paisley fabric! the seams look really sturdy and the skirt moves well. it's very cute and super easy to wear. i styled it with brown boots, an retailer belt and a white button down. great for spring/summer xx
10595	"These are great, casual, comfy pants for summer. i'm 5'1"", 95lbs, usually a 25 or 26 in pants. the reg 25 was a better fit than the 26p."
10596	This is more a sweater than a sweatshirt but it also feels more casual, like a sweatshirt. i put it on and immediately felt comfortable. it's stylish but not frumpy and it will work for me running around town doing errands or going out for a casual lunch or dinner. it's a perfect weight sweater to throw on in the cool cali evenings.
10597	"Lovely jeans, love the details in the cuff bottoms. the front of the jeans, the relaxed ""boyfriend"" part was just too relaxed for me - too much material there that it was unflattering. otherwise cute."
10598	
10599	This is a very pretty color. loved the flow and the length of this top. however the neck hole seemed too small for the top. all the embroidering is at the neck and makes that part very stiff. going back
10600	I wasn't sure what size to get in this and how it would fit since there weren't any reviews but i ordered it in a size 10 and it fits really well. i usually get dresses in a size 8 but those flow a bit more and this on my waist (am curvy on bottom) i needed to get the 10, it sits well on my waist and i don't have to hike it up. the material is chino like so it does get a bit wrinkled but it has a nice weight and the pleats give it a pretty flow not too boxy making my hips look bigger. it has bel
10601	Love this tunic. very comfortable and a perfect length to the knee. i wore it to a birthday party with brown booties. the green moss color is perfect for the fall in new england. can't wait to wear it again.
10602	Better than the picture - i like the layered look and the texture of the fabric. great top.
10603	This layered top fits true to size. the style is trendy and cute. the type of fabric is nice. i love the design of the back. i would definitely recommend it. it's worth the money.
10604	"For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips) i ordered the small and i was absolutely swimming in it. perhaps the petite would have been better, but there was just too much fabric everywhere. the sleeves were ridiculous on me, and even cinching the waist with a belt just wouldn't have slimmed the silhouette for me. i have muscular shoulders, and 34d chest, so the top fit as it should, just everything became way too much elsewhere. the fabric was soft and sw"
10605	This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy, so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall, this was just a miss for me.
10606	I love these tights!! they're thick and durable and the pattern is super cute.
10607	"Great summer pants.....nice material, easy to take care of. i'm 5'6"" and usually wear a size 29, which i purchased the neutral. they might be a little bit loose, but they fit great, and best of all, they truly are slimming. i love them so much that i just ordered the green.......hard to top the sale price"
10608	I bought this top in the gray color and my usual size large.   the fit is perfect.  i don't have the tight neck issue that another reviewer had.  there is an odd knitted neck that you can't see on the model since her hair covers it.  i love the softness, fit, and embroidery of the top, but was debating on returning because of that weird, stiff neck knitting.  my husband said that he really liked it, so i gave it a shot.  i'm wearing it right now and it's super comfortable. i don't notice the nec
10609	This was way too big on me, so i gave it to a friend. not only does it fit her really well and look great, but it has become her new favorite sweater! love the casual everyday style, and am tempted to order one in a smaller size for myself.
10610	"Love these tights. fabric feels great, soft and comfy. took large so they fit perfectly at true waist for 5'6 height. some retailer tights i have bought in large, but they are too short for 5'6"" person. the color of this paid is a subtle green. looks great with black skirt and green sweater."
10611	Unfortunately this one is going back. the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back.
10612	I'm not nearly as tall as the model so these hit right just right for flats. i love the fit of the wide leg and found the color matching the photo and the light color cords very soft. i did try the blue color on at a different store and found them a bit short. i'm really pleased with these and the sale on sale certainly helped.
10613	"I got both colors as i'm not sure when a style that is so perfect for me will come around again. these are beautifully designed and very slimming. they are described as crops but i am 5'5"" tall and the length is perfect, approximately 1/2 above the heel of my shoe. no alterations required!!! usually retailer pants are extremely long for me but these citizens of humanity cords are the perfect length. the colors are just as pictured-i was surprised by another review that described the navy as"
10614	"These are cute, comfy and just as pictured; a soft greenish-gray but i didn't find them to be super flattering on me, or at least not slimming in my view. i'm 5'3"" about 105 lbs., and got them in s/m which fit just right, but they do go all the way up to my true waist. they are ""tube legs"", meaning they're not contoured tights. so there's excess fabric at the toe (it'd be all bunched in flats) and there's a tiny bit of looseness at the ankle. there's also no distinguishable front or back (and no"
10615	These pants are so comfy and perfectly casual without being sloppy. they're the perfect summer pants.
10616	I love the coh fleetwood jeans, and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans, i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods, which are a substantial weight denim, these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in, these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.
10617	It is a little boxy, but it?s not unflattering in my opinion. the sweatshirt material is soft, the ruffles keep their shape and position, and aren?t too overwhelming on my small frame. i like the small slits on the sides, they allow the sweater to drape nicely. it also hit at a flattering spot, a little below the hip. 5?1??, 100 lbs, and got the xxs petite. this fit true to size for me.
10618	These pants have quickly become my go to spring pant. comfortable and a long enough crop for my 5'8 legs, almost closer to the ankle which i prefer. i wore them 3 times with out washing and they did stretch out a bit but there is a set of buttons in the hip if i really needed them tighter there. i bought the darker color, its a mossy green/grey. it looks sharp with the tla black v-neck t shirt.
10619	Looks great on the photo and from previous reviews i decided to give it a try. the material seems cheap and stiff. would not fit my frame well.
10620	The concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice. the inner layer is sheer but as long as you're wearing a nude-colored bra, no big deal. however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy. they must've photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top, because it looks like it hangs straight on her. i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package, it clearly flares out & is a-line. so as a previous reviewer stated, it looks huge from the front. if it had fit the
10621	"Dear retailer & designers: just want a nice dress that isn't made from polyester! don't mind paying bigger bucks for quality fabrics, but please- enough of the polyester!  love, your customers"
10622	"I bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide. i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online. the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model. i am 5'1"" tall and weigh 110 lbs. i believe the petite would have been a much better fit. i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available."
10623	I totally agree with the first review. i thought this was soooo cute on the model, but it's loose fitting and has no shape to it.
10624	This top is really cute online, but that's about it.  it runs large, but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly.
10625	"These are the best trousers i have bought in a long time! i'm 5'8 and 145 pounds and the 8 fit with a bit of extra room in the waist--not enough to size down. i love that they are not ""skinny""--so over the skinny fit. i plan to wear these with black heels, white tee, and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same time--oh, and a statement necklace--always a statement necklace. these are a must for every fall wardrobe! more pants like these, please!"
10626	I wear a 32 and sometimes a 31 but i could barely squeeze these on in a 32. the fabric is thick with lots of stretch but these are super skinny all the way to the ankle like a legging and not a jean. made for much thinner frames than mine.
10627	The sweater material was fragile. there were already two picks in the fabric when it arrived. i felt like it would not wear or wash well. i was also disappointed in the shaping or how it hung on my body. i am returning the sweater.
10628	I totally disagree with previous reviewer on sizing. i am usually a medium (sometimes small) in various retailer tops and i purchased this top in a small. i could barely get it over my head. i then ordered the medium and large. i tried the large on first and it fits perfectly. (like the model shot). so i would say this definitely runs small. i never wear a large. for reference, i am 36c, broad shoulder. the gold beading on the top is very pretty and the gold embroidery thread really pops. t
10629	"I have been a paige/pilcro lover for years! these mcguire jeans went on sale and i loved the neutral color so i ordered my usual size 28. they fit perfectly!! as a previous reviewer started, they are tight . . .they are skinny jeans and are meant to be tight. they hug in the right place, are not too high waisted and are a sturdy denim. for reference i am 5'2"", 120 # , short waisted and usually wear a 28 in paige/pilcro. these mcguire's, sized 28 were a great fit, good length, no hemming required"
10630	These pants are so great. very comfortable, true to size, and i can see myself wearing these all spring and summer. i'm 5'1, 120 lbs, and my usual 26 petite fit great. these would also make excellent travel pants. i purchased the green color, and will be purchasing the tan color once i get done writing this review.
10631	I don't know what the problem with this sweater was on me but it just didn't work. it was too wide across the breastline, i think, creating a boxy shape that just didn't look flattering. outside of that, the sweater was lightweight and seemed well made. i was sad to send it back, especially at the sale price.
10632	This lightweight sweater arrived within a few days of ordering and was packaged well. its fit is true to size and will be perfect for slightly cool days and evenings. the navy blue color is accurately represented in the picture. my only issue with this item is that one of the small lace panels at the hem on the hip is not sewn in all the way. i will keep it since it was on sale, but i need to decide whether to have it fixed or to just remove both of them as they are very small and don't add much
10633	I've returned multiple pairs of trousers this fall because they were low quality/ wrinkle-prone wool and unlined.  the material on these, however, is high quality and weighty, wearable in fall, but also great for our much colder winters. the herringbone is gorgeous - dark grey and black with subtle flecks of red, dark pink, and gold. they are also beautifully lined so will keep their shape and not itch! true to size for cartonnier: got a 2 and tried a 2 in the monica flannel trousers. gorgeous!
10634	"These are the perfect light weight relaxing summer pants! the fabric is soft and light, and has some stretch, so i think they can be worn more fitted way, too.  i don't want to show off my bottom half of my body shape, so these are perfect ones to be a bit loose to covers the silhouette but still looks feminine & not too loose.  i''m 5'3, 115 lb and usually wear 25-26 jeans, 25 petite gave me the perfect relaxed look without losing the feminine look. i think 24 could fit as well, but would sn"
10635	This top is much more beautiful in person than in the photo. the embroidery is exquisite and there is the tiniest bit of sparkle amidst the design. soft, flowing and flattering. definitely a keeper.
10636	I loved this top even more in person! it is made well and beatiful! the sheer under layer adds a sexyness to the design. the back of the shirt is open. i really like this detail!
10637	Prettier in person! so pretty! i'm 5' 6'' 120 lbs and the xxs fit well. i normally wear a 0-2.
10638	I am so glad i got these pants. the quality is great and the fit is perfect. they are very flattering and comfortable. i have worn them with flip flops on a casual day and have also worn them with black heels for a date night. worth the purchase!
10639	I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.
10640	
10641	Saw this top online and knew i had to have it! it's unique and gorgeous with the split back and two-layer design. the top layer is thicker and almost like a brocade/tapestry design with rich purple and yellow tones. the under layer is sheer and lightweight. i was able to wear this early in my pregnancy and it totally disguised any bump i had from co-workers. this is def one of my top 10 fav tops now!
10642	In the photo and from far away this top looks more elegant than it truly is. wearing it feels like something better suited for sleeping in. it's a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off and raw edges, which looks rather cheap and sloppy.
10643	Adorable romper. the only thing is the sleeves are a little shorter than portrayed in the picture. they come to about mid-forearm on me (and i'm a petite person). still cute but def not if you're looking for a full sleeve.
10644	I wanted to love this top. it was huge and i didn't like the material. it felt like it should have been much less expensive than it was.
10645	"I just received these jeans today after buying them online last week. i wasn't sure how they would fit, but i am so very happy i got them. and on sale too!! i am 5'2"" and about 128 pounds. athletic and curvy but petite too. i bought the size 4 and they are a perfect fit in the length too. they are button up, boyfriend style but not too baggy. the detail on the cuff is perfect and they have a unique, unusual but expensive look. what a steal !! i would have paid full price for jeans that fit this"
10646	This top has gorgeous embroidery, very very nice, looks good in both wine and grey. it runs large. i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it. i usually wear xl, i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top. i have a big bust, and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering, because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery. the arms also tend to look wider due to the style. i don't like the fit at all.
10647	I have now purchased these pants (online) three times in the ivory. i first ordered them in a 28 as it was the only size available, and i thought that size would fit me in this brand. wrong! i was swimming in them. great pants, but too large in the waist. i kept checking online and they popped back in a 27, which i thought would fit. wrong again! they arrived a couple of days ago, and still they are too large in the waist, but since 27 was the only size available, i thought that i would keep the
10648	Love these! they are my new favorite weekend pant. they are comfortable, versatile, and cute. the fit and cut are great too. a must have for your wardrobe.
10649	This is so much better than wearing a grey sweatshirt. i love it and it makes me feel pretty.
10650	
10651	
10652	Purchased to speak at an event. not only is it very eye catching and i garnered many compliments it fit like it was made for me and was comfortable to wear. i questioned ordering a 4 and possibly could have worn a 6 but with the elasticity to the material there was no problem with movement or sitting and i felt hugged in in all the right places!
10653	Remarkable dress, so much so that people stop me to remark about it!
10654	I wore this to a wedding yesterday and received several compliments. the dress is well made and very comfortable. i know i will wear it again.
10655	Wore it to a cousins wedding. loved it! probably one of the best dresses that i have ever worn. lots of compliments. felt great dancing the night away.
10656	I was so excited to get the dress, it's extremely beautiful and comfortable. the size i picked was unfortunately too big for me though, i just had a baby so it's hard to figure out what size i am now..details were exquisite.
10657	I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a 2 and because of the stretch in it, it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.
10658	This dress is a beautiful, classic dress that is figure flattering and as stunning in person as it is in the photo. i love it!!!
10659	Love this dress. sexy but still appropriate. very elegant. i'm 5'6, 125 pounds, and the size 2 fit me great. it is a little long so i am considering ordering the size 2 petite. definitely worth the money.
10660	Great dress, received tons of compliments. downside to the dress is it stretched a bit and was feeling a bit loose by the end of the evening.
10661	"This gorgeous dress arrived today and i can't wait to wear it. based on other reviews i ordered a 6 petite even though i'm 5'6"" because i wanted the skirt to hit just above my knee. it's perfect. i usually wear a 4 or 6 and the 6p fits well, not snug but not big either. maybe a 6r would be larger, i don't know. if you are worried about the skirt being too long then definitely try a petite size.   the dress is risquã© because it's faux ""see through"" but still very classy and elegant. it's sexy w"
10662	This dress fits like a dream and looks gorgeous on. i'm sure it will be a go to for many occasions.
10663	I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews, but as you can see, the dress didn't live up to them. i ordered a size 8, and maybe a 6 would've fit better, but i'm not going to find out. the sheer area on the model really stands out; it does not in real life. there were loose threads throughout, and there really shouldn't be at this price point. i was going to wear this to a wedding, but as a member of the wedding party, i don't think it would picture well at all. i'm sorry that it's headed
10664	Very cute summer dress. it runs a bit large and it doesn't give you shape. but, it's good for me to hide my belly fat. the dress is so comfortable to wear. i didn't know that it has pockets, so that was a pleasant surprise (i always love pockets). overall, it's a perfect summer dress.
10665	This dress is amazing. i bought it for an afternoon wedding i'm attending, it's perfect! it fits like a glove and the lace is so delicate. the nude sheath really allows the lace and all the details to stand out. love it in the black!
10666	This dress is absolutely gorgeous! love, love, love! i am 5'2 and the petite sizing was perfect.
10667	This is my 4th byron lars dress and i just love this designer. his dresses all fit the same as far as i can tell. i had bought this dress as my sister in law recommended it so much and she was right it is stunning!
10668	I ordered my normal size in this dress. i am 6 foot tall, but the regular sizes were too large and too long (mid-calf). i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline. the dress is lovely, especially on the models in the pictures, but didn't quite work out for me. also, it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time!
10669	This black dress is stunning...i've already worn it to a fashion show and a wedding and i received so many compliments!
10670	"This is a very flattering dress that is perfect for those little black dress occasions. two other people in my family own this dress and love it, it's now my turn to add it to my collection. the dress is quite long for my 5""6"" frame, so i have reordered it in a petite size for a little better fit and length. the lace is very detailed and the nude slip underneath keeps the lace from being too revealing. very elegant, a little chanel like. and by the way, the belt is included, as another reviewer"
10671	I had really high hopes for this dress based on the reviews. i'm on the curvier side, but was surprised to find that my usual size 12 was very loose and long - the hem hit just below my knee. instead of feeling sexy, the weird fit just made me feel matronly. i'm going to exchange for a 10 petite, which will hopefully be a little more figure-hugging and not as long. despite my fit issues, the design is stunning, intricate, and unusual. i'm hoping that the new size will do it more justice.
10672	I generally wear a size 6, and am 5 ft 3 in in height. the size 6 fell below the knees and did not look right. the fit of the 6 petite is beautiful and flattering. the dress is indeed lovely, and i really want to love this dress as much as others do... however, i am conflicted. i am modest in my style, and even though nothing is revealed, the strategic placement of lace panels makes it a bit suggestive, and takes it out of my comfort zone.
10673	This skirt is a great addition to my wardrobe. the print is sophisticated and style flattering on any body. it can be dressed up or down and could be worn most of the year. maybe not on those hot summer days, but mild ones, for sure with a pop of color tank or t.
10674	This dress is absolutely perfectly delightful! fits like a glove and is stunning on. i couldn't be happier with this purchase! i wore it to a wedding in october and felt beautiful and sexy all at the same time. i usually struggle with dresses because i am under 5 feet, i purchased a 0p and it fits very well. no tailoring needed. only problem was that once i was on the dance floor the hooks in the front of the dress began to come undone, yikes! i had to leave the dance floor a couple of times and
10675	I bought this dress for the kentucky derby. i was worried about wearing navy to an event known for bright colors, but the gorgeous lace and rosettes are light and beautiful. i paired it with a lavender hat, and i was ready for a mint julep! i usually wear a 2 or a 4, so i ordered both. the 2 fit best. i will be wearing this dress to a wedding in the fall and for many events for years to come. stunning!
10676	"I was looking for the perfect july 4th weekend dress, with enough room to be comfy (and eat!) while also being chic and feeling cute.  i got countless compliments on this dress.. the design is adorable, and the fit is really flattering. i'm 5'4"" and i weigh about 128 - i normally would have worn a small, but i had to spring for the petite xs. the design is a bit big and billowy, and anything else would have swallowed me up.  overall, great purchase. i am in love! :)"
10677	"I've been looking for white beach shorts and these are perfect! as another reviewer said, they are in fact see-through -- because they are meant to be a cover up, not ""real"" shorts. the hem detail is very cute and they're super comfortable! my size small fit tts, and the 3"" hem is nice for tall women."
10678	Got this dress in the mail today, and i am blown away. the fit is amazing! normally i would get an 8 in dresses, sometimes a 6, i got a 6 in this one and it's perfect. hugs in all the right places. everyone needs this dress! i feel like with the style and fit of this dress, it should be a little more snug so i recommend sizing down. cannot wait to wear this one!
10679	I love this dress! it's very cute and comfortable. i belted it to give me more of a waistline because otherwise the tented shape overwhelms my short stature. i love the strap design at the neckline. the off the shoulder sleeves are comfortable. i have an xsp which is true to size for me.
10680	I am fortunate to work in an environment where i can wear jeans just about every day. so, i am always looking for a good pair to add to my collection. i bought this style on a relatively quick shopping trip with not a lot of thought. well, 2 weeks later i was back buying a second pair.  the color is great, a little darker with that warn in look but no whiskering with a fit that is tts. i like the higher waist to cover my mommy-tummy and my butt looks pretty fabulous. but, the best thing about th
10681	"Incredibly flattering and going to be useful for multiple occasions - i needed a 'default' black dress and this is it.  only downside - it's pictured with a beautiful grosgrain ribbon at the waist, but does not actually come with the ribbon. i'll be trying to find something similar at a ribbon/embroidery shop, as the dress would really benefit from a slightly cinched waist."
10682	"This dress has been on retailer's site for a while now (years?) and i finally grabbed one during a recent member sale. i can't believe i waited so long! it's so gorgeous on - classy but still distinctly sexy. i'm 5'10"" 160# and the size 8 fits great - definitely fitted through the hips and thighs and roomy enough on top i considered taking it in. beautiful dress overall!"
10683	I am so happy with this! i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving it as i expected it to be of lesser quality than what i found it to be. it is a medium weight weave, grey sweater with a beautiful design and texture; one of those pieces that you will tire of long before it wears out! it is a great layering piece but not over bulky or structured tops as it is very smooth fitting without a whole lot of give. that is to say it is not loosely woven so it is better over a snug fitting item. the colo
10684	This dress is really lovely. it looks so fragile online but in person is rather structured and substantial. it runs very large i just returned mine for 2 sizes down. i also like the zipper up the back so that the eye hooks on the front are not necessary to use to put on. the interior lining is affixed so there is no slipping like a typical under slip. if you are on the fence at least try it. i am glad i did.
10685	
10686	I wasn't looking for a little black dress but i couldn't resist this one. it's as stunning in person as it is in the pictures online. the front has a corset-like closure which i didn't realize until it arrived. it's very classy though, not cheap looking. the lace detail is really beautiful. i was a bit concerned about how the sheer looking areas would look because i was hoping to wear the dress for a dressy work function. it's definitely a sexy dress but the fact that there's so much coverage ma
10687	"This is truly the best black dress...you can wear to sooo many things. a long time keeper for the closet. i felt it ran a little bit big...i am normally an 8-10...i bought both sizes (8 and 10)...kept the 8...but felt i could even get away with a 6...but didn't want to pay shipping again for another size. i am 5'7"" and 155lbs. it is truly a flattering dress for any figure."
10688	I love this dress. i found it to run one size big. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and went down a size to a 2. i purchased both a 4 and 2, then tried them on a few times, and the smaller size didn't pull at all because it fit me right, the larger one, hung lower and didn't look right. i received compliments all night when i wore this and paired it with black heels and a small back clutch. very comfortable too.
10689	"I don't know that there needs to be more reviews, but here goes.   the dress is gorgeous! i have never received so many compliments on a dress of mine, and i have some really lovely ones. strangers and friends alike were complimenting me. i had been eyeing this online, but never pulled the trigger thinking i'd never need a dress like this anytime soon. then i came across this in person at my local store, and i instantly fell in love. don't hesitate! and, if you're lucky that retailer is having o"
10690	Love this dress. the fit is amazing. i wore it to church for my brother's wedding and got so many compliments. it looks great in photos too!
10691	I would not have spent this much on a dress without a gift card, but it absolutely lives up to the hype.
10692	"I've eyed this dress forever and finally decided to buy it. i literally read every single review to make sure i ordered the right size. i'm 5'4-3/4"", 36c-32-37 with a drop-waist that measures 34. based on the reviews, i ordered a regular size 6. i tried it on with a bra and also without, and the dress fits so well and beautifully both ways. but for complete comfort, i'll probably go without the bra (the lining and design don't show anything you don't want seen!). sitting in it feels great too. i"
10693	I disagree with reviewers who said the dress looked cheap, cavernous or stiff. quite the opposite. i wore this to my 32nd anniversary dinner, and two women stopped me to say i was stunning. i am an average medium hourglass. the dress arrived in 2 weeks and was true to size. i wore a nude lace strapless bra underneath. the hem reaches the bottom of my kneecaps. the lace sleeves were not tight on my fleshy arms. the neckline lays flat. the dress zips in back, and the silver hooks in front are most
10694	"Fabulous dress! clip off the tags because they show through the lace on the back (you can see this on the back photo of one recent reviewer)."
10695	I love this dress and am strongly considering buying the white, too, but i wish it came in another color other than white or black, because i would get that. goes great for nice dinners, dates, weddings, almost anything. it's not ball-gown fancy, but just fitted and nice enough to wear for work or a nice evening out. only problem i have are with the clips in the front. i have a hard time using the loo because it is very fitted, you have to un clip them and then re-clip, but it's worth the effort
10696	This is a unique beautiful dress and it fits like a glove.
10697	I so wanted to love this but was underwhelmed - ii am tall but yet it hit below my knee in that awkward spot that is just a tad too long to be hip stylish and too short to be evening cocktail - just felt / looked frumpy ... i do think it looks great on other reviewers though so may just be that if wasn't a good fit for my body type - i wore my normal size 6 and it just didn't flatter - made me feel 10 years older
10698	"I love this dress. i purchased a size down from my normal dress size after reading the reviews. i'm 5'9"" 148lbs 34dd and the size 6 fit perfect. the attached slip is a tad darker than my  very fair skin color but it still works. can't wait to dress it up with some nice heels."
10699	This sweater is light gray, as shown in the photo, not dark gray as the description states. i went up from my usual size so would say it runs small. it is lightweight enough that i think i will get adequate use out of it this winter in fl.
10700	I purchased this dress for my 50th birthday bash!!! it was stunning!!! the fit was perfect. i did buy it a size up, but could have worn my regular size. it is incredibly flattering and elegant. very well made. one of my go to black dresses for the summer!!!
10701	The picture doesn't do this blouse any justice. the fabric is really nice and the back is really what makes this blouse. the bows down the back of the blouse make it pop!
10702	"This dress is gorjuss!! i thought i would be in between a 10-12, but after trying on the 8 in the store--i'm a perfect 10. i was a little nervous about the price, but then i said, ""treat yoself!"" and made the leap and didn't look back. i felt so confident wearing this to a wedding and received so many compliments. i wanted a dress that made me feel sexy, without showing so much skin--this achieved it all! make the purchase--you won't regret it :-)  i'm 5'8, 195lbs and the 10 was spot on!"
10703	I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with. my recent preference has been for high-rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash. when i tried these on in my normal size, they were so cute that i bought them full-priced. i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy (which is what makes them soft and comfortable), but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours. by th
10704	"I am a proportionate 5'4"" 39 year old and thought this dress would look great. it's a-line and looks a lot like the kind of dresses that usually fit me nicely. i bought it in an 8p, which is my normal size. the hips were a little too big, but not bad. the top part, however, was enormous. the cut in the shoulders/neckline was way too wide, the lace sleeves were way too big, there was too much room in the bust (my c cup was inadequate), etc. this dress would look nice on someone who is thicker/vol"
10705	This is a gorgeous sweater but huge. and when i say huge, i mean gigantic. i'm usually a size large and i don't even think the small would be small enough. the cowl neck and fabric overall is great (although stretches out, which is why it becomes so overwhelming) but the sweater just hung on me like a short blanket. the armholes are very big - deceiving on the model. returning.
10706	I was feeling defeated in my search for a dress for some upcoming holiday parties while shopping today. i saw this dress in the dressing room as another customer was trying it on. she was a shorter petite woman and this dress looked amazing on her. it instantly caught my eye and it looked great on her! i went and was lucky enough to find a size 10. lately i've been closer to a 12 sadly and was worried this was going to be another bust. i'm 5/11 and much curvier than the woman i saw in the dressi
10707	Lightweight, soft cotton top and shorts. i think it's meant to be a beach cover-up but i'm wearing it as a thin, light-weight summer outfit on these hot hot days. the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didn't realize when i ordered it, but i like it and it matches the look in the photos. and the shorts are very low-cut - don't expect them up around your waist. again, i like that. some might want to wear a cami underneath because it's a thin cotton but i'm fine as-is. i bought it i
10708	I think this dress is beautiful. i ordered it for my brother's wedding, but the nude slip underneath made the dress look a bit too revealing. i may keep it for a holiday party though because it really is gorgeous and super flattering. it dies run large. typically i'm a 10 and the 8 fit perfectly.
10709	"I tried this dress on in store, and i realized it is true to size in every way. i am 5'1 and needed a petite for it to land just above my knee. this dress was elegant- i wore it to a wedding and some thought it was a ""rent the runway"" dress! ha! i'm way to classy for that. for all you ladies who want to look sophisticated in those cooler evening events, this is your dress! i felt so elegant and danced the night away and had no issues! the clasps go all the way down the dress, so i do suggest (li"
10710	Best jeans ever. i have 2 pairs now. after getting my first pair last year, i knew i would be needing another. most comfortable, form fitting and flattering jean ever.
10711	I love these jeans! well worth the price. waist hits just right. the stretch is great. i can wear them with riding boots, booties, and flats. i love them!
10712	I have purchased over 7 byron lars dresses. i'm addicted to his style and perfect fit for the curvy woman. whether you are a 2 or 12 you will feel beautiful and if you care to present yourself on the occasion as a most lovely lady that oozes of mystery wear this dress. throw your next day dirty hair up with any classic retailer pins, barrettes or headband along with a strong lip color with earrings only. or go nude lips, smoky eyes and heels. this dress carries itself. don't over accessorize with
10713	I wore this to an engagement party and got compliments all night. it is absolutely gorgeous and very slimming! i got a petite 4, and it fit perfectly. for reference. i am 5'2 and 125 lbs. you ill not regret buying this dress!
10714	Bought this dress for a friend's wedding. i have since worn it to two others and the opera numerous times. it's my favorite little black dress as it's sexy and modest at the same time. i receive numerous compliments every time i wear it! it's easy to get into, the zipper is sturdy and the fabric is breathable, stretchy but not clingy.
10715	
10716	I really liked the casual style of this top, but i was disappointed when i put it on.  it's cut weird- the shoulder cut-outs are smaller than pictured and just don't seem to hang right.  they don't hit where they're supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured, more like 3/4 which i didn't like.  the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off.  i tried xs and s.  both fit weird.
10717	Too small... too flare... nice thick fabric. not my favorite pant.
10718	This is a really cute sweater. it's thick enough to keep you warm, but it just didn't look right on me. it made me look frumpy.
10719	"The fit is gorgeous, but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut, high on the shoulders, you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute, but not practical."
10720	Bought this in my usual size small and it fits well. i wear it around the house constantly to stay warm this winter. it is so very warm and comfortable. very easy to wear. could be worn out, but i prefer it with lounge pants due to the comfort and warmth it provides. it is a nice neutral and can be worn with many other retailer casual clothes. highly recommend!
10721	
10722	I typically wear a medium, but went with a large because i am pregnant and tall. i think i could have used the medium in width, but like the length of the large. it is a wider fit and is significantly shorter in the front than the back, but i think works with the look of the top. i think you could dress it up or down and the fabric is cozy. i would highlight that it has a wider fit, but i think that is the design of the top. overall, i am pleased and i think meets my search for an off the should
10723	I really like these but my usual size 29 did not fit. i always wear that size in pilcro but these were at least a size two small and i have to return them. regretfully, they are out of size 30 so i lose out. wish there had been previous reviews to let me know, so i'm doing so now for anyone thinking of ordering.
10724	I was really disappointed with these pants. they were a thinner fabric than expected with little to no stretch. they were very tight around my legs and huge at the waist. sadly, they will be going back.
10725	The color and the fabric in these shorts is quite nice as is the length. i didn't order the pilcro bermudas because another reviewer said the legs were quite wide. unfortunately, these shorts also have wide legs. i'm going to have them tailored so they hug the legs as in the picture rather than billowing out. i do not have skinny thighs(don't i wish!) and i was surprised that the fit was not as pictured. if you're ok with wide legs or can get them at a price at which you're ok spending extra for
10726	I thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build. instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected. i felt dowdy in it.
10727	I really like this top. is casual and easy to wear with short right now and will be super cute with jeans when it gets cooler.
10728	"I'm 5'4"", usually a small in retailer sizes, 6-8 pants, i purchased the 8 petite"
10729	I wore out a pair of level 99 shorts a couple of years ago. ordered these in the same size and they are huge. so i am sending them in for exchange and hope i'm guessing right. linen and tencel are my two favorite summer fabrics. love the length which can be adjusted by rolling. good pockets. gorgeous somewhat dusty plum color. belt loops if needed though i rather hope they're not.
10730	"Just got these in black and they look great! they are a great combination of classy and casual with the added bonus of being super soft! they are, however, very fitting/slender, but give a little with wear. as others have mentioned, they do run a little small, so sizing up one was the right decision. at 5'5"", they fall at just right place on my ankle. great pant overall - always love pilcro!"
10731	"The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite. i am 5'4"" and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered. the length was not what made me send them back though. the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick, stretchy and well made. however, the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material. if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great"
10732	"If you're expecting a sweatshirt when you order this, you might be disappointed. it's actually more like a banded t-shirt, which i don't mind. i'm 5'2"" and the length comes just below the button on my jeans. perfect length for us shorter gals. sleeves are quite long on me, but i like to wear them pushed up anyways (and they actually stay up). i wouldn't pay full price for this, but it's a nice top at the sale price. cute with destroyed jeans or black leggings."
10733	Not sure why it has gotten good ratings and or why sold out online periodically. awkward fit and flares quit a bit at waist. also has extra material at waist line so does not look flattering.
10734	This sweater is a hit. the color is fantastic and the shoulder cutouts add a feminine and unique touch. looks amazing paired with booties, a statement necklace and jeans. definitely affordable too! highly recommend
10735	I've always been a pilcro fan and they always seem to fit just right. this pair of velvety pants was no different. lightweight velvet and a great cut. yay!
10736	I wish i had purchased these earlier in the winter season because i could wear them every single day. they are phenomenal, plus i got them during a great sale. the reviews i read said they run small, so i went a full size up and they fit perfectly. (i usually wear a 4, bought a 6.) one of the best winter wardrobe purchases i've ever made. totally versatile and because they're black, they can be dressed up, or down.
10737	I loke the idea of this jacket but it was executed poorly. it makes me look like a football player! i am 5'8 135/athletic build and i was swimming in the m. i tried a small on in store and it still looked like i was wearing shoulder pads. it hangs and gaps awkwardly. the sleeves are freakishly long and the overall length was too short.
10738	These are beautiful pants! the wine color is rich and they are very soft. they just run really small. i normally wear a 25 regular but often i have to roll the length up a bit. so, this time i ordered a 25p thinking it would be the same just shorter -- but i could hardly even pull them over my slinder size 6 foot. i am going to exchange them for a 26 regular. i so hope that they fit -- they are so lovely!! i totally recommend -- just order a size, or maybe two, up. though, to be fair, maybe peti
10739	"I love this jumpsuit. i've worn it twice and received many compliments both times. absolutely gorgeous. i couldn't be happier. 5'5"", 135, 34c-6."
10740	"This is cuter in person, more of a brown than a cream like in the picture. it runs a little smaller than i was expecting, but that's actually good for me as things usually are a little loose up top. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 32c, and an xs fit well for a sexier look, but if you're wanting it a little looser, i would go up one size."
10741	This is a great shirt with cute details including the ruffled back. i am petite and needed to shorten the sleeves, but otherwise the fit was true to size and not too baggy or too tight. the material feels avergage in quality, but looks polished with navy blue pants. i received several compliments during my first wear. overall, a very cute shirt!
10742	"Color, fabric blend, and pattern are even more beautiful in person! unfortunately, i wont be keeping this due to length. i am only 5'3"" and this top dropped only to about 2 inches below my navel. if you have a short torso, or like the short look, i would recommend this!"
10743	
10744	I recommend this product if you are tall. the pants fit great but they are too long. im 5'7' and they drag on the ground.
10745	These pants fit great. the velvet material is a sleek look . these pants can be casual by day and are easily dressed up in the evening.
10746	"These pants are amazing! i love that they zip in the back and the material is just right. i am 5'7"" and they are the perfect length. i bought the black and now buying the gray. i hope they come out with more colors!!!"
10747	I was very hesitant to purchase this with such a high price tag but i just received it in the mail and it is absolutely beautiful. feels and looks high quality and i can't wait to pair it with the top the model is wearing in the photos. definitely worth it!
10748	I have other pilcro cord leggings & the black ponte knit leggings in my usual size 28 in this brand. they fit well & have a nice stretch - very comfy. i ordered these velvet leggings in the 28, the blue & the wine, & they just don't fit the same as the others. these are a little short in the crotch area & the legs feel restrictive & not much give. i have skinny legs! length is perfect though at the ankle. these same exact pants were just in at the store in black & fit a little better, but i don'
10749	"I ordered this online expecting more of a heavier sweater. its really more like a t-shirt which is actually fine. its super comfortable and it's really cute. my only complaint is that it is pretty short. i'm 5'7"" and i would love it if it were just an inch or two longer in the torso. other than that it's a great shirt."
10750	My bridesmaids gifted this to me at my bridal shower, and of all the lingerie i received that day, this was the most memorable. it is equally romantic and sexy as it is subtly sheer. the delicate eyelash lace detail adds so much flair. i have this in size small and it fits tts. love this piece! i plan to wear this for my boudoir shoot.
10751	I love the pilcro pants and so when i saw these level 99 shorts i just had to order. they arrived and are as good as i hoped. the fit is great, the length is great (i don't like shorty shorts) and i love the color. the photo is very true to life in regard to color. i will definitely get a lot of use from these this coming summer.
10752	Cute blouse & great price !!
10753	Incredibly soft and comfortable, not as fitted as i would like (this often happens to me with skinny pants, though). i want to wear these guys everyday!
10754	
10755	Really great best.  nice substantial material and great fit.  will be able to wear with many things.
10756	Loved this shirt but it runs pretty big. i'm normally a sm/med due to bust size (34ddd) and ordered a small based on other reviews. could have gotten an x-small. debating going to exchange. i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale. better quality than some at retailer.
10757	Runs large. very stretchy. nice wash. mine had more holes and fraying in the legs than i expected. i returned them because i got the wrong size and smaller sizes are sold out. otherwise a cute jean and with the sale, certainly worth it.
10758	These run at least 2 sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand, mother. such a bummer because the quality is totally on point. i'm going to exchange them for a huge size i guess. whatever, i don't mind having a size that's so much larger than all my other jeans. i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process. i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control. it's not retailer's fault. so annoyed.
10759	These corduroys are comfortable and fit true to size. (i am just over 5 feet tall, 106 lbs, with long legs for my height, and the 25 fits really well.) they wash and dry well, with minimal (if any) shrinkage, as long as you use low temperatures. i gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, because i feel the material could be more substantial than it is. the green is actually a very attractive mossy brown.
10760	This shirt is amazing. i bought it in white and found i was wearing it with everything...so i went back to get the gold (which is yellow). the dit runs big so order a size down. love the riffle around the sleeve and the little dot trim. very cute!
10761	Cute, casual dress -- i especially love the thick fabric, as i think it will hold up well. the fit is slightly boxy, but it's short enough for it not to matter as much, and the waist tie helps give the dress a little shape. i was surprised that the the petite xs was off for me proportionally (usually i wear petite sizing at retailer) but the regular xs fit much better.
10762	I love this top, it gives a little bit of a sleeveless look yet is more flattering on the arms for those who don't normally wear sleeveless tops. i think it runs very large - i'm normally a size s/m and the extra small was right. it's loose around the waist yet has a feminine fit.the tiny balls around the neck, button at the back, flutter sleeves, and linen fabric are all cute details that make this top unique. i also like how the fluttering goes down the sides and not just around the sleeve.
10763	I got this dress in the mail, and while i loved the concept of it, it really is too boxy. the tie is very superficial and does not really nip you in at the waist, it is more so for show. it is fully lined which was interesting, and to me, made the dress seem boxier. the quality is good, but i am an hourglass and this was completely unflattering. i would have had to size up to make it look like the model shot, but it would have still been a shapeless dress, just bigger. it does fit true to size,
10764	I love this pajama combo! it is super cute and comfortable!
10765	Pretty top, i like the flutter sleeve design.  the linen is thin- too sheer to not wear a cami underneath the white.  nice for the sale price.  can easily be dressed up or down.
10766	I got them in green and the color is very nice. the waist is a little higher than the ag cords, but that only makes them comfortable and holds the tummy in a little good length and the pant holds up nice thru out the day, no sagging yet in the knee and behind area
10767	This top is beautiful and the color yellow is gorgeous. i highly recommend!
10768	"These pants are so soft and stretchy they feel like leggings. i love the ankle length as they are perfect to wear with both flats and booties. i am 5'5"" with fairly long legs and these hit right at my ankle. they are so comfortable i have ordered in the green, red and gray. my ""go to"" pants this winter."
10769	"I first saw this online, and as a long-time wearer of vests, this really caught my eye. once it came into the store i was able to try it on, in grey small, and it was perfection. it just wasn't in the budget so i decided to wait for it to go on sale and watch the website every day. we have 5 stores in my area and when it got down to only 2 having limited availability for a small i sprang into action. the largest store had put it on the ""almost gone"" rack and they had only 2 smalls. i tried them"
10770	I got this vest for my birthday and it is my favorite. it has a very clean design, well structured and you can really tell the product is high quality from the look and touch. i would expect this to stay in my closet for years to come.
10771	This little pantie is fun and playful. its a deep maroon color with small shimmering lace details. the back is sheer but the front is more filled in and opaque. the ribbons on the sides can actually be untied which is a big plus for me. i'm a small lass, but i have a big bum so i got a medium and it fits perfectly.
10772	Feminine flow, however slightly large. such soft material. love the little details.
10773	
10774	I found this dress to be shapeless on (even when the belt was tied). i love the tshirt material and the fact it has short sleeves. it's just too boxy.
10775	"-like others, i agree that this is a staple that will pair with many, many outfits. it is really well-constructed, classic, comfortable, and a wonderful length for us taller gals. as you can see from my stats, i'm rather tall at 5'9"", so it's hard to find"
10776	I ordered my normal size 32. they were a little tight however i'm glad because they normally stretch out quite a bit so i'm assuming they should fit perfect after one wearing. the length is fine for my 5'9 height and they are very soft.. i'm so happy with the light red color, it's almost a rust which i love.
10777	I ordered two pairs of the red cords, one my typical size, one a size smaller in case i found that the pants stretched out. they run true to size and have a nice fit with a high(er) rise waist. the color is beautiful. i did not find that the pants stretched out but they do seem to bunch somewhat which may come from the thickness of the material.
10778	The fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful, but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look. i have a large chest, but the similarly cut blouse (without the textured fabric - from the same designer) fit me fine. this one is just cut differently. i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail. the photo on the model seems misleading because i don't see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest. i was so
10779	Unfortunately had to return this. i loved it but just doesn't work for my petite size.
10780	Love this top. have two of them. they are comfy, light-weight and extremely flattering. love!
10781	I love this dress! i was trying on some dresses in the store and the sales girl put this one in just for fun. i would have never picked this dress out. i didn't look awesome on the hanger. but i tried it on anyway and i ended up getting two other dresses at that time. but i couldn't stop thinking about how much i loved the way i looked and felt in this dress. so i did what any girl would do and bought it online. it took me a while to find it online because the picture on line doesn't do the dres
10782	I really like the idea behind this top, but at least for me, the execution wasn't quite there. i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work, but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace (when it gaps/you move, you can see a lot). if you don't move, the front panel is pretty opaque, which is good. i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i don't feel comfortable with the sheerness, so i returned it. i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked
10783	Cute and comfortable. paired with tights and boots for work, will also look cute with flats or sandals in the spring. the fabric is a nice weigh, not too flimsy. might be a bit short on a taller gal.
10784	This dress is very versatile and i plan to use in all year round with some tights and boots in the fall/winter and strappy sandals in spring/summer. i originally purchased this dress in a m but had to size down for a more snug and flattering fit. the navy is much darker than the picture.
10785	These pilcro jeans are so very cute. i usually wait for a sale to purchase the pilco jeans, but i didn't want to chance them not being available in my size. the pilco jeans seems to sell out fast. the cotton material is very soft but not sloppy. you will love the embroidery down the side of the leg. they do run a bit big. i purchased them in one size smaller for a slimmer fit. i would suggest one size up if you like them more baggy.
10786	
10787	Found this cute little black sweater on the sale rack in a small and it fit perfect. it is flattering and will look great over a tank top or strappy dress. the little details of chiffon around the collar and the tiny cutout holes around the back, the softness, and the little detail on the back bottom make this a perfect go to sweater for me. i only say it runs small because it is a cropped style so expect it to be short, but i would agree that the arms are more to the snug side than the loose fi
10788	It is a very pretty skirt but arrived extremely wrinkled and the waist is very fitted. overall i probably would not have purchased it if i had actually seen it in the store.
10789	I usually wear a size medium in angel of the north but this was very small. i would need to have ordered a size large or xl to have it fit. pretty but returning.
10790	Such a lovely skirt. i plan on wearing it to a formal event, but could definitely see dressing it down with a jean jacket. it is so feminine and beautiful. well made and fits fine.
10791	This is really cute sweater, soft, cozy. around the chest bit small went up size but the shape looked the same. i'm keep it because of softness, warmth and versatile. i got it in black. would recommend it, or at least try it for yourself.
10792	Love this dress! wore it last night for a musical event... came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold water...just as the label states. pulled the dress out and guess what? the design is completely faded!!! it looks 5 years old :( so sad. i'm going to call retailer and ask for a refund (i live two hours away)
10793	So pretty, love hte design on this one. i tried on hte regualr size, adn will not need a petite, it hit me jsut above my knee. younger gals may oprefer shorter, however.  the aottern is also nice. the cut is flowy and flattering, nothing bad to say about htis dress...
10794	I ordered the xxs because it seems like a flowy top, and glad i did, it fits perfectly. love the blue color, very rich. material is super soft, cut is very flattering, and i love the back. i tried it on with my strapless since that is what i was wearing, but not sure if straps show on a regular bra. (30dd for info)
10795	While the print is cute, the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra, more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully, if retailer continues to do swimwear, they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)
10796	I tried this in the fish print and the pallas stripe. i did not like the fit of the fish print, but the stripe is perfect--so try more than one color if you are interested in this style. also try more than one size of course. i almost always order up in a swimsuit, and this time was no different. the medium fit great, although i am a xs-s according to the size guide. i am a 34b for reference, but i think my rib cage is somewhat wide. i do not like to feel constricted, but i still want the top to
10797	There is nothing special about this skirt. it's plain and incredibly dowdy looking. long and wide. i am usually between a small and medium. after reading the other review that said the waist ran small i went with a medium. it fit fine in the waist/hips.
10798	"Great cut and fit. tts. size 6 fit my 5'5"", 135 pound frame (34b/c bust) wonderfully. my sister and best friend loved it on. but i'm returning. the color is more of a very bright orange than red. i would want to wear this in the middle of summer but the all-polyester fabric is hot. i have too many dresses in my closet. cute as it is, i'd just never pick this one. love to see this design in lighter fabric and different color options. 1-2"" longer would also be a slightly better length."
10799	Very flattering and flowy dress. would pair this dress with cowboy boots or navy wedges.
10800	This is my favorite shirt ever. i've had it for years and it still looks great. please, please bring it back!!
10801	This top is well made and the pleats give it a whimsical feel. i'm still debating on keeping it as it's slight boxy.
10802	This unique blouse is very comfortable and looks beautiful on the body. it flowy and flattering and looks great with my tan. dress up or down, it's a staple in my summer wardrobe.
10803	This sweater is just the cutest- sweet and feminine with interesting details especially in the back. it's very figure flattering worn closed (there are 3 adorable little buttons) or it can be worn open over a dress or a cami. it runs very small, i usually wear a small or extra small but i bought this one in a medium, mindful of the reviews. i'm so glad i did since in addition to running small the sweater did shrink a little when i washed it even though i hand washed it in cold water. it wasn't a
10804	"I adore this dress. the fabrics are elegant and unique and combine for a stunning look! tried with a belt and looks wonderful with or without......so many options. perfect dress for warm autumn days! ordered my usual size and fits very true to size. a must have!"
10805	"This is a soft, light sweater that will take you through fall. i got the raspberry, which seems more like a cinnamon color to me. the design is really cute with the fabric inset in the back. i got three of these in different colors so obviously i really like them for layering and can recommend them! it seems tts. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs. medium is perfect."
10806	This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also, the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.
10807	Super cute in raspberry and very flattering! i paired it with the reversible tank in dark gray, skinny jeans and fringe boots.
10808	Not only was it love at first sight when i saw it online, but i fell even more in love at first touch! everything about this dress is perfection. i got the black motif & the colors are just lovely. the weight & feel of the dress are nice, & the length is great. i added a skinny black belt for more waist definition, but it's cute with or without it. i am more than pleased with this purchase.
10809	This romper is so flattering. i normally don't like how short rompers are, but this fits and flares at the perfect spots on me. not to mention that it's super comfortable. i wore it last weekend and got a ton of complements. very happy i bought it! i normally wear a medium, but the small fit me perfectly?i'd recommend sizing down.
10810	I really wanted to love this dress, but even though i got a small, it was still too big. i also don't think the horizontal pattern was a good look for me, other than that, it is beautiful and the fabric felt nice.
10811	This is the prettiest little sweater with such nice details. but it will not work well on a person like me with a full bust (38d) even in a larger size than i normally wear. it is also very, very short in the body. i would recommend it for a petite person with a small bust though.
10812	"Love love this piece! for the moment i saw it i noted anther catalog, i knew i had to try it on... im 5' 9"" and 130 and the xs fits me perfectly. i love the way it is tailored. it is also lined with a nice fabric. overall a very well made summer go to piece!"
10813	This is just adorable on. i go between a small and medium and the small was perfect for me.. i wore this with tights and boots, but can also see this working in warmer weather with sandals or peep-toe booties.
10814	I bought this lovely cardigan in the orange color. it is so beautiful and feminine. i wore it buttoned over a slim tank and got several compliments right off the bat. it is a sweet and unique take on the classic cardigan in a way only found at retailer. i usually wear a small and it fits true to size. i did have to return the one i purchased because it had a hole in the sleeve, but thankfully was able to order another. on sale, it's a no brainer!
10815	I really like the dress it is cute and comfortable. the only problem i'm having is finding leggings that match the way i want. dress will be cute with leggings and boots or sandals in the spring. it is very casual.
10816	Can't say about fit just yet since it is a gift; color is soft green and versatile. finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt
10817	
10818	Such a fun and beautiful skirt, absolutely love the cut and the way it flows when walking ! it is very very bright in my opinion and not so much my style so i will be wearing it sparingly! got a ton of compliments the first time wearing it
10819	Seemed pretty shapeless which surprised me because of the design. perhaps it was just too big. returned it.
10820	Cute dress. can be worn with boots, flats, or heels. i am 5'1, 112 lbs, 34 b chest and i got this dress in size petite small. i am pear shape, with a bigger bottom, and love how dress enhances my shape! my style is more classic, but i really like this dress.
10821	"I was at first a bit leery of this dress because of the shape. baggy is in, but it's not always flattering. i am usually a big small-medium and the medium was too fluffy. i realize it's supposed to be loose, but not that loose. i'm 5'8"" and 146 lbs and the small was the best option. perfect amount of looseness but still gave a hint of shape. it has pockets and is so comfortable. i'm a school teacher so i try to find clothes that i can wear in both worlds. this is definitely a keeper! i will for"
10822	The colors and design of this skirt are beautiful. the fabric hangs nicely. the color i more burnt orange than red. i ordered my usual size (6), but it is too small.
10823	This sweater has every special element i could want .... form fitting, feminine, and attention to detail. i ordered it in turquoise, which is a lovely muted turquoise that works well when dressed up or down with a cream cami. because i am petite, the fitted waist detail in back hits me just in the right spot. thank you, retailer, for another timeless addition to my collection of yours.
10824	I've been wanting to try on this dress since it popped up online, we visited san francisco this weekend & i finally got my chance. it fit great & was flattering! i am currently pregnant & it worked with my growing belly but will also look good when i do not have a belly. i would definitely recommend! <3
10825	I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately, however, i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.  the quality seemed okay, but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.
10826	So this skirt is everything. the only downside is that it's not in a petite sizing so i'm going to have to get this altered (i'm 5'3). the sizing is appropriate (usually wear an 8 or 10 in pants and got a size medium for the skirt), the material is thick enough for spring or summer weather, the color is just right (not too light), the pockets are adorable and i feel like i'm channeling some 70's realness, sits higher on your waist, and is super comfortable. i know i'm going to get a lot of use o
10827	Absolutely beautiful and well made. this pair of jeans is perfect, no flaws whatsoever. i usually wear size 27 but bought the 26 as it fits better. 27 is very slightly loose but i think it supposed to be like that for a boyfriend jeans. i prefer it nice and fitted, so 26 works better. i'm lucky to find them still available in the store while it's not online. i didn't hesitate to buy at full price, which i rarely did. i'm so in love with my new purchase. very happy!
10828	Great style - can be dressed up or down.
10829	Gorgeous! purchased in red; color is glowing if you have warm complexion/cool undertones.
10830	This dress looks so plain on this model you'd never guess it looks so adorable on. i saw it as i walked into my local retailer and tried it on quickly over skinny jeans i was wearing with grey suede boots and it looked amazing! it's a perfect teacher dress. wear it over tights or jeans during colder weather, chunky sandals during warmer weather. it has side pockets i absolutely love. you must try it on to believe it. the fabric is soft and of great quality.
10831	This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.
10832	I had only planned to check out this dress at the store but ended up buying it then and there! not a deal breaker but there were extra threads hanging from some parts of the dress. it made me a bit concern that the stitching would unravel during wear. so far, so good! i wish they had paid more attention to little details like that.
10833	"I think these jeans are much better in person than on the picture. on the model they look a bit boxy and too loose for my taste. i am tall, slim/athletic and they fit like made for me in my usual size. they have some ""give"" and tend to get looser while you wear them, but because they are midrise they won't slide down. they are a slightly relaxed swlim fit on me. the demin is solid, the color a nice medium dark sky blue. the emobroidery and the beads are beautiful and look like they will hold up"
10834	"These jeans are fantastic! i've worn them once and got many compliments. definitely keepers. i am 5'8"" and weigh about 135. normally i wear a 29 but i sized down based on reviews to a 28. they fit perfectly at the start of the day, but as all jeans with a bit of stretch do, they get bigger as the day goes on, but because they're a boyfriend cut it all works. really happy with this purchase. my only regret is that i didn't get two pair."
10835	I bought this dress for spring/early summer thinking it was light and airy but the fabric is too heavy. because the color is dark (even with the flecks of peach), combined with the heavy fabric, it's too much for spring. this dress is perfect for early fall weather. the dress fits fabulous and very flattering. i love the side pockets. it hits all the right places. i'm hourglass shaped, full figured. i normally wear size 14/16 and i bought this dress in lg. again, it fits great, but too heavy for
10836	"I love the way this dress looks on me. it skims my figure to hide my flaws, the bright embroidery is eye catching, the layers flow when i walk, it's a great midi length and it doesn't make me look wider in profile.  i'm not having the see-through issue since the patterns are busy and my lingerie matches.  i purchased 10 petite and my measurements are 39-28-35.    my dilemma is three fold: the material is polyester & rayon, causing some uncomfortable heat to generate when sitting. then there's"
10837	I've been craving this dress in the brown pattern for a while and should have jumped the gun before the sale. so now i was left with size sp and i look like a fool--like i'm trying to wear a top from junior high and pass it off as a dress. my shoulders
10838	I saw this dress on the cashier at retailer and had to order it. it is, as one of the reviewers said, like having two dresses in one. the bottom dress is a full dress, and the top lays over it, not quite skimming but not quite loose either. i love the dress as i am a pear shaped, size 14, and this helps to camouflage some bumps nicely. this dress reminds of the dresses some peasant women wear in rural countries.
10839	I was doubtful when i first tried this on. the holding horses brand tends to not quite fit me very well, more so in dresses than tops. also, it looks cute but not great on the hanger. this a must-try-on dress. it's just flowy enough to not look sloppy or maternity, but also feel easy to wear. the print and cut are flattering. it has pockets!!!! also, the length is nice, close to knee length. the fabric is good quality. doesn't wrinkle easily. i'm surprised how quickly i fell in love with this dr
10840	The outer layer runs large up top; also, the orange stitching (the flowers) on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath. i'm returning it because for the price i don't love it.
10841	I saw this dress at my local retailer and passed it the first time. one week later, i stopped by and skimmed through the store and went back to the dress...and decided to try it on. boy oh boy! i grabbed a small and a medium (i usually wear a medium) and the small fit perfectly! the fabric is thick and feels so soft and nice. i love the pockets! worth the splurge and like the other reviewer said- it's not maternity like at all. i plan to wear it with brown boots or brown heels.
10842	
10843	"Well...this is ""on me"" as i saw this hanging in the store, but way off on my size which is xxs petite.  i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.  both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no ""flow,"" just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.  this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes"
10844	I saw this dress in the store window and had to try it on and it is perfect! it's lined, got pockets, can wash at home, and is a work appropriate length. it's cold in the northeast right now, so i'm wearing it with tights boots and a cardi. i really like that it isn't fitted, but is form flattering. overall win!
10845	Better than a regular boring cardigan. goes with short sleeves and dresses!!
10846	I noticed this dress in the highlighted area and then read the reviews. i probably wouldn't have thought much about it just scrolling through the dress pages, and now i'm so glad i bought it. i have worn this dress several times and never fail to get compliments on it. i know i will wear it again come next fall. i am petite, but ordered the regular and find that length to be perfect. i'm a teacher and this dress helps me maintain a classy yet modern look. i purchased the small (usually wear size
10847	This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however, like a previous reviewer, the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted, without all the excess fabric at the bottom, it would have been perfect. again, the color, the lace, the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came
10848	I saw this in the store a few weeks back and desperately wanted it. when it wet on sale, i grabbed it! i normally wear an xs or petite s, but with this one, the petite m was the winner! i am chesty and the top would not have zipped up had i gone any smaller. it is a bit wide on the bottom, and i agree with the reviewer who said it should be a bit more tailored on the bottom. still, with some awesome heels, this is a great summer piece! the lining is great quality. love it!
10849	I love everything about this tee. it has wonderful detailing that makes it different from other tees. the fabric is soft, and the tee is very comfortable. i disagree with some of the other reviews about the colors. i actually love both colors. the red is a nice slightly brownish red. i wore that color with a pair of plaid (white, teal, & taupe) shorts, and i got compliments on my outfit. the color will go with more than one might think. i haven't worn the green one yet. i hope this tee comes bac
10850	I am a large in knit tees. this is the first tee where the large was just too big. it kind of hung on me. the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me. the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it. i liked the whole design a lot, especially the front macrame part, but for me it did not work at all. also, too expensive for a tee.
10851	"This dress is quite lovely, but there are a few things to know:  the blue color is much more of a dark teal, with more of a dull green tinge than i expected. still pretty, but definitely not a pure blue. i loved the look of the blue online, but i think the pink might have worked a little better with my coloring. the dress is a bit low in front. not inappropriately low, but if you are hoping to be able to ""adjust"" by pulling the shoulders back a bit or something, be aware that the bodice drapi"
10852	Is this dress ever flattering! i have seen many variations of this kind of dress-some where they will kris-cross over the breast area, some where they will have a single twist-but i never have seen one like this with a double twist and oh, what a difference it makes. i particularly love this in blue-which was a very bright royal color in-store. i am not very chesty, so the accenting in that area is very flattering on me and made me fall in love.
10853	Love this sweater - very soft and can be dressy or casual.
10854	This top was fun. casual with flair. it is a little strange that it is see through down to the stomach almost, but i would just wear a bra of the same color and don't think anyone would notice.  i didn't buy because even the sale price is too much for a casual tee, in my opinion.
10855	I love this dress. as a taller, long-torsoed woman, the sleeves are long enough and the length is perfect. the overall fit is also quite flattering, but i can imagine it might not be if you're shorter.  the material is really lovely and luxurious-looking for jersey. it seems like it should wear well.  a great work-to-evening option, as well!
10856	A sales associate handed these to me while i was trying other things on. i had never tried the hoxton before. i have found my perfect black jean! they are so comfortable and they don't stretch out like others i have tried.  i am 5'4 and i roll them a few times but i like that look. i am usually a 25 and that is what i took in these.
10857	"This nightgown looked so comfy and cute! i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tight.i'm 5'3"" and 150lbs. it was such a shame. size large should not just be really a medium!"
10858	Paige denim has done it again with this version of the hoxton high rise. no matter how many times i tell myself that i will find a less expensive pair of jeans, i never can find jeans that fit as well and last as long as my paige jeans. this is a sleek pair of skinny jeans with the added benefit of being high waisted. as a mom who hates always having to worry about spilling over the top of my jeans (no matter how thin or fit you are, i'm sorry ladies, this problem is real!), the hoxton high rise
10859	This cardigan's color is great. it goes with a lot of items surprisingly. the fit is a little large/loose, but that's nice for being able to wear various shirts underneath. i've received lots of compliments on it.
10860	Very comfortable, feels like you're wearing pjs while being dressed up. fits true to size. very elegant dress, rich navy blue color. versatile, can wear with heels, boots, or flats.
10861	The blue dress is lovely, fit true to size and a good all around, comfy dress.
10862	Super cute and simple shirt (as other reviewer said lol). but she was right! i have another shirt from this brand and it's one of my favorites. it runs true to size. it's a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall. it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i'm only 5'2 and i wouldn't want it to be any shorter.
10863	"I saw this skirt in retailer several months ago and while it caught my eye, it was pricey. so i waited until it went on sale and pounced.  unfortunately i ordered a size 6 which is enroute.   i happened to stop by our local store today and decided to try on the 6 and ended up getting a size 4.  so i'll have to return the size 6 when it arrives.  i think it runs tts. i've lost alot of weight recently.   the colors are vibrant and it has a nice weight with some stretch in the fabric.  it's a"
10864	I saw this dress couple weeks ago and i really liked its color. the dress was ok untill i wore it. well. it's one of those dresses which are not great on hanger but great on you. well, the color is awesome, matches with other bright colors, mustard yellow, wine or black. the material is very thin so if you put size down it will fit but make sure that you see yourself in the mirror and see your back; i saw many ladies which put the dress which fits them but it does not fit the way it supposed to
10865	Beautiful color and super comfy. it runs large but the gathers still allow for it to have shape on the top.
10866	I paid full price for this cardigan and have not regretted purchase for one minute, having worn it almost every day this summer.  it is the perfect weight for cool summer evenings, seaside strolls, chilly restaurants, or  for a sunblock layer when you have to be outside.
10867	"I tried on the regular size at my store and it was too long for me, te sleeves were enourmous, and the dress fell mid-calf. but, i love the feel of hte mateiral, and if it were to fit properly, is very falttering. i will order the petite size later on to try, i liked it enough for that. the ""blue"" is a nice teal color. double layer, and extremely comfortable. the finish is laser cut, no stichting."
10868	Just bought this cardigan today. i'm already a fan of left of center and was happy with this piece. it's soft, has more interest to it than your average cardi. the sleeves are a bit long, but it's not a dealbreaker. i imagine it will be a great transitional piece from summer to fall and then for spring time.
10869	Beautiful color, bought a small (i am 5'10 and 145 pounds, the length is the only thing that is usually a problem on size small for me) however the chest area was extremely tight and ill fitting i thought, i am only a 34b. i'm returning it. i did think it was pricey for what you get as well. the color was by far the best thing about this dress, it could have been better quality and fit.
10870	"This is a nice year round weight sweater.  i am thrilled with small details, true to retailer pieces."
10871	I oot this dress in the blue. it fits great--hits at the knee, not too short or awkwardly long. i just wish they had it in short sleeve so i could wear one for the summer. beautiful and easy to wear for work or fun.
10872	I love everything about this dress. beautiful vibrant color and fabric. i got the sp which is a perfect length for me to wear with the jasper & jeera nijar sandles. it is very flowy and full but i love that about it. happy i was able to snag a petite size but i think the regular would have been ok. i could have gotten away with an xs but the small fits great!
10873	I was sad that this was only online because i wanted to try on the xs and small to compare. i usually wear an xs in most antrho clothes, and i decided to get an xs because i was afraid the peplum part would be large. however, when i got it in the mail, the xs is too small! i tried to get it in a size up, but i couldn't find it. it's a cute shirt, but it runs small. even the length of the shirt is shorter than i would have liked. if they had the correct size, i would have gotten it, but this shir
10874	Seafolly is my favorite swim/beach brand. the quality is always great! this is a colorful sheer kaftan that will get much use this summer.
10875	Love, love, love this piece! very flowy, but made of good material. glad i purchased this item!
10876	"I bought the rose and the sapphire during the xtr 40% off clearance. i'm just under 5'4"", curvy & usually wear med petite in retailer dresses. i ordered a mr because, being sale items, only regular sizing was available. a sp would have been much better! the dress hit about 3"" below my knee and the crisscross top made my bust look matronly. a snugger fit would have been sexier. the rose was darker than pictured & pretty, but eh on me. however, the sapphire was gorgeous. i'm sad about returning it."
10877	I love, love this top! it's the perfect peplum tee! i would get more if this was offered in more color combos! the stripes add a cute effect to the tee and it's a perfect soft cotton. can't say enough about this one!
10878	"I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining, but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk, instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well, but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes!   i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews"
10879	Love the weight. something i can wear winter and spring.
10880	Beautiful cobalt blue dress. i wore it for christmas and had many compliments.
10881	"I love this top! i love the detail in the front and the v back. it's simple and sexy, easy to dress up or wear casually. i ordered an xs and found it to fit perfect, i'm 5'5"" and 112lbs. i ordered the olive green color which i love. i don't typically wear red so that wasn't an option for me, i do wish it came in more colors!"
10882	Love this sweater. ordered white, size large. great light layer! the weave in the yarn is really pretty; the variations in texture have an almost burnout look. the silver buttons are unusual, really stand out and complement the overall look of the sweater. it has an uneven hem that drapes beautifully at the back and sides. great value on sale! one of those basics that everyone needs in their wardrobe.
10883	Love bailey 44. this dress does not disappoint. the blue is beautiful and the fit is very flattering. the material is really soft and the dress is very comfortable.
10884	"Wish this site had ""ask a question about the product"" feature like amazon does. just wondering if anyone has seen this product in person to verify color? it looks orange but descriptor says red. would appreciate feedback. thank you for your help."
10885	Better than the picture, right chest neck line not too low. comfortable material and the cut is just right. bought two in different color.
10886	I bought this dress in blue. it's a light jersey material, but it is lined. i find it very flattering. i have found more occasions to wear it than i expected.
10887	"Got this dress on sale. it fits great. i am 5'8"", small bust, small waist but bigger hips. and this dress makes all those areas look great."
10888	
10889	Lots of stretch in fabric so pants fit well. length is perfect for me. i'm almost 5ft 6 in and they hit at bottom of ankles with slightly extra fabric so flats, heels, or boots work great with these pants. i bought size 29 and i'm 135 lbs. colors in pants are beautiful. many different colored tops go well with them
10890	I love wearing this dress and have had many compliments. it's a great color and a fabulous fit
10891	I bought in white. great for a lightweight cover up. well made and cozy!
10892	"The cut of this dress is gorgeous and it could be great if it were made of quality silk and was lined. although the color is beautiful, the cheap fabric has no variation, is too saturated, and lacks any sheen of quality silk.  shocked at the price. i still have beautiful silk dresses from retailer pre 2010 . being back the quality!"
10893	I love this dress! it feels great on. it's very light. the color is absolutely gorgeous! the only thing i was disappointed in was that there was no lining, for the cost of this dress, it should at least be lined.
10894	If you've been an retailer lover for awhile, you have at least one of the left of center thermals. every single year they come out with them and they are best sellers - so when i saw this is couldn't believe it!!! it's just like the left of center thermal shirt, but a cardigan! soft, warm but thin enough that it would be a perfect layer for the summer. be warned that this fabric does grow with wear. definitely size down a bit. the body is full and the sleeves are fitted. lots of stretch and very v
10895	This sweater is a nice weight and may run a little on the large size. the orange is a nice tone--more on the blue side-- which suits my coloring more than a more yellow-orange. it is bright! i think it will look great over black top and slacks or light color top and jeans. nice weight for fall. a bit on the stretchy side so i hope it won't stretch too much out of shape.
10896	"Super cute! very light and flowy. i ordered the black. packs well wasn't wrinkly when i took it out of the suitcase. i ordered the black. so happy with my purchase."
10897	I am a 32dd, 5'4'' and 125lbs and this top was way too baggy. it looked awful. this is shapeless and oversized. i would size down or just pass.
10898	I recently purchased this dress and am so happy with it. the gathered area over the bust is visually interesting and isn't too revealing. the jersey material hangs beautifully. i also appreciate it being lined.
10899	I own a couple of bailey 44 dresses and am a huge fan of their comfort and ability to flatter my figure. when i saw this one on a special promo, i knew i had to try it on. once i did, i knew it had to come home with me. i wore it to a work event last night and look forward to wearing it on a date night soon. i am a s or m and took a s in this dress. i went with cobalt and paired it with gold jewelry as in the photo.
10900	I am a big pilcro fan. i have a really tough time finding pants that fit, are comfortable, and flattering all at once, and these didn't disappoint. the colors are beautiful and saturated, and just like they appear in the photos. i got my usual pilcro size, and the colors give me endless styling ideas. i also got them in the black and ivory print.
10901	Fabric felt and looked cheap.  hem was completely frayed, all the way around, perhaps purposely, but ratty looking, all the same.
10902	Looks great, the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!
10903	Like the previous reviewer, the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is. i'm 5'4 and ordered a 12, which is usually what i wear at retailer. even only being 5'4, this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated. it fits everywhere else, though. i'm obsessed with the back so i'm going to keep it and wear it. i'd say it's worth it at the sale price.
10904	After reading reviews, i ordered a medium instead of a large even though i am typically a size 12. it was definitely the right decision. a very flattering dress in a beautiful color. if you order in the right size, it is not at all dowdy. it is forgiving in the belly area, which is great for me. it can be worn with tights or without tights, so really quite versatile. i am sure that i will wear it a lot. also, it is very comfortable.
10905	I have trouble finding pants that are long enough and also narrow enough on my hips. these fit like a glove and never stretch out.
10906	Super soft. pretty blue green color. packs super well for traveling.
10907	I love this dress, it is so comfortable and elegant at the same time. i try to not buy dry clean only pieces, but i had to make an exception here!! perfect for early spring days.
10908	I was really pleased with this skirt. the lightness of the fabric is nice and the colors matched the photos. i was initially concerned that it might be stiff and uncomfortable, but it feels like it has a bit of stretch and offers some good movement. sometimes retailer skirts seem to run small to me, but this fit perfectly in my regularl size.
10909	"This is a beautiful dress! the color is really great and i love the cut - flattering around the neckline and loose and flowy.   the one downside is that it is pretty long. i am 5'6"" and usually somewhere between and xs and s for dresses, so went with the xs. the size is great but it's just a tad long for wearing with flats. i actually think if i was bustier the length would be fine, but since i'm pretty flat there's nothing to fill the dress! i wish i had been able to snag a petite, but they w"
10910	This gathered jersey dress is beautiful and flows in just the right places, however it runs large! i normally wear a small in many retailer dresses, however i ordered an xs petite in this dress based on other reviews. i'm glad i did because it fits perfectly. the dress is very flattering in the bust...and the rest of the dress hangs and flows nicely. this can be dressed up (with statement jewelry) or down depending on the occasion. i'm happy with my purchase, so much so that i bought one in
10911	I do not see this as frumpy if you wear it with heels. i think the bodice is very flattering.
10912	I have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans. sadly i don't think these are it. i love the design and style of these jeans. great length, great cut, great color unfortunately in the 3 weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like i've had them for 3 years. i'm so disappointed. and will have to continue on my search. apparently they don't make jeans like they used too?
10913	I got the sweater in red, (i'd call it more orange). it's a bit of a baggy fit, not tight which i love. i feel like this will be a perfect cover up for cool summer evenings. i got a medium. i go between small and medium and i love the fit. i could have gotten a small, but i liked it looser, the buttons are special too.
10914	
10915	The blouse is absolutely beautiful. i am 5' and the length is perfect. even though it fit a little snug across the chest, it's a keeper. i'll wear it open on the top with a nice cami underneath.
10916	I have this shirt in the gray and in the orange and i just love the details on front.
10917	This is a wonderful layering piece for the office. the material is so soft, like a thick velvet, but not quite. it is cute with a sleeveless body skimming top underneath, b/c it fits loosely. not for 90 degree days, as it is a bit of a heavier summer material. the orange-peach-coral color is really unique!
10918	"This is my third dress by this designer. i love his work. this will be the most versatile and classic of the three. i love how wearing his dresses makes me feel... my best and comfortable. unique and well made."
10919	This is a pretty red dress. the back is beautiful. i ordered it online and was excited when it arrived. however, as soon as i took it out of the package, i saw that it had a snag on the front bodice. i also did not realize the dress material was not as heavy as i was hoping for it to be. given those two details, i decided to return it. maybe if it had arrived in perfect condition, i would have kept it. *sigh*
10920	I love this dress but sadly for me it didn't look good on my body type. i'm a 36 dd and not thin so it made me look like a beached whale. i saw it on two different sales clerks in the stoe and they both looked adorable.
10921	Not only is this dress incredibly comfortable, but it can be accessorized for any occasion. i jazzed it up for a wedding, but a cardigan and flats also makes it easy saturday perfect. only way this dress could be improved.... pockets.
10922	"I'm 5'3"" 115 lbs and ordered an xs petite. i have other dresses from maeve in xs petite and xxs petite that fit really well, but this one was weirdly big at the top"
10923	Wonderful dress! thank you for making a fun and sassy dress that actually fits me! normally this sort of dress wouldn't fit, with it failing me in the bust, but it fit quite well. in most cases, i would end-up in a 12 petite to accommodate my bust, but with it then too large in the shoulders, or, the dress would have run so small, i wouldn't have been able to button it in most places. i was pleasantly surprised not only with the fit, but the quality, as well.  as described by other reviewers, it
10924	"Love this dress! i'm 5'4"", 110 lbs. i ordered 2p. the dress is stretchy at all the right places and accentuates your curves. it's very well-made. i usually like loose fitting clothes, but i feel this dress needs to be snug but not tight. i tried 4p and it was just a bit loose. this dress is well-worth the price."
10925	"I had been hearing a bit of hype around this dress. it had seemed that most were either loving or hating it, which can be true for a lot of ""swing"" dresses as some give off that ""baby bump"" vibe. i saw a friend try one on in petite and we both agreed it ran a little short, even for us at just over 5 feet tall.   when i finally made it into a store i noticed that they had quite a few in regular sizing in stock. i grabbed a xs regular to try on and i loved it. with heels, it falls perfectly and"
10926	I received so many compliments on this dress. i purchased my usual size 12 and it fit fine. i agree with some other reviewers that i could have probably gone a size down for a more snug fit.
10927	I wanted to love this dress. i've been looking for a cute, flattering red dress for ages and snapped this up on sale online, thinking it was finally the one. when i tried it on i found the shape flattering, even to my recently pregnant figure. other than that, i was highly disappointed for two reasons. one, quality issues, as mentioned by a previous reviewer - the slip is sewn in totally unevenly, resulting in it sticking up above the neckline on one side, with several threads poking up above th
10928	"Beautiful dress and so delicately well made! 5'1"" 95lb - xxs petite or the smallest size possible worked for me it accentuates one's curvy body and covers up any excess skin in the belly area. i could eat on freely at a formal occasion. words just cannot describe how beautiful this dress is."
10929	I ordered this dress in my usual size and unfortunately when it arrived, it was damaged and also a little too big. the fabric had lots of pulls in it like it had been tried on many times.  i called customer service and requested a replacement in a smaller size. it fit great and looked beautiful but there was a rip in the sleeve.  this is a gorgeous dress and very flattering and well fitting (if you size down), but i had to return both and wear something else to a holiday party.  i'd only recomme
10930	The lower part of dress bunches where buttons are, so the dress doesn't look flushed from top to bottom. i ended up returning it.
10931	I like this dress a lot, the fabric is nice, the necklines are unusual and flattering but there is definitely some added volume at the hips with the pockets. really comfortable dress.
10932	I had been admiring this dress for over a year and finally treated myself to it for the holidays. first, it is gorgeous and very thoughtfully designed to make you look amazing. where things fall off the rails for me is the fabric choice for the sleeves...they are sooo delicate and evidently snag far too easily. the dress that i received in the mail had two large snags (one in each sleeve) that were already running a bit. to me that was a huge red flag that i shouldn't be spending so much money o
10933	Swing dresses can be so iffy but this one is fantastic! i sized down to an xs due to the chest area (i'm usually a s/6 up top 36b) and it fits perfectly. the dress is so comfortable and stylish without feeling like you're wearing a tent. this is the most i've ever spent on a casual dress and it is worth ever penny. could not be more happy with my purchase.
10934	Amazing dress! i'm a pear shape, and this dress is a very complimentary cut for me. it's also not too short. the color print on the dress are amazing. i'm very happy!
10935	"I tried it on while out of town. i was concerned about getting it home but i kept thinking about it. i purchased it online once i got home. the colors are beautiful. it's a swing dress with quite a bit of ""swing"". this is perfect for me because i'm sensitive about my mid section. i wore mine with 3.5in brown sandals. my husband said i had ""legs for days"". i'll take that as a great compliment. i usually wear a medium but could have worn the small in this dress. i preferred the medium because it w"
10936	"Simply put, this dress will make you feel like joan from mad men (in all the best ways). amazingly form-fitting and impeccably constructed, like you imagine clothes used to be. it's true there are hook & eye closures between each button from about the waist up; yes they are a bit tedious, but they're essential to the flawless, gapless fit of this button-up style. i'm 5'4"" 120-125# and got the 2p based on reading every single review posted. it's a *tinge* tight but i'm very happy with it and the"
10937	I tried on the 00p in the store as a return, adn though it would fit (super stretchy)hte dress ended up mid thigh for me... gorgeous design and make though, the buttoning is incredible, buttons and clasps to keep the dress closed. love love, wish htey still had my size (0p or 2p ) to try if hte length would be better (or regular size)
10938	I love the colors, and saw the xxs p in a store, so tried it on, but sadly, that was still a lot of fabric on me. i think if you have very small thin arms, that may work, but with muscles, it just made me look bigger than i am... the design (pattern) is really nice though. 115 lbs, 30 dd flat
10939	I though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's not. first of all, it runs very large. i purchased a small (i am usually a xs or small in maeve, i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress). the shoulders were very wide, you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it didn't lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest, and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless. i really wanted this dress to work (i love
10940	I am currently wearing this dress. i wear it whenever i can get away with it. i have it in red and it works incredible on my coloring. the front is modest enough for work while the back is sweet and unexpected.
10941	I love this dress. i get so many compliments from strangers every time i where it. must buy.
10942	Looks better in person than the pictures online. very soft and comfortable. if you are between sizes, size down. it is roomy with a lot of material that drapes in the front. just know that this sweater is short in the back and does not cover your backside.
10943	I very rarely buy at full price but had to have this on and it is worth it.  i sized down and fits great. tons of compliments!
10944	Bought as a gift. really soft and cozy. i am sure she will love it!
10945	I absolutely love this product! it is so versatile and i can wear it up or dress it down. absolutely perfect paired with leggings to sit in classes all day :)
10946	It's a nice drop-waist, embroidered, lightweight dress for summer. my problem was that the armholes were too large for me and i found that to be unflattering. it's a swing style so it's forgiving in the hips and belly.
10947	I've been looking for the right swing dress for a long time and this one is perfect. one of my favorite features is the design at the hem of the dress (it looks even better in person!). the material is a thicker, almost canvas-y type of fabric, which i love because it makes the dress feel higher quality to me. i love how comfortable the dress is and it's so easy to throw it on and look amazing. i tried on two sizes at two different stores and received compliments from staff and customers both ti
10948	I don't know if i was sent a petite by mistake, but this is not 39 inches long. i realize it says swing dress, but i thought if the length was accurate and the fabric heavy enough, the weight would make it flattering on me. as it was in reality--short and light-weight fabric--it poofed out in an unattractive way. too bad, as the print is lovely.
10949	This is a fantastic dress! i wore it for a recent wedding and received many compliments. the fit is phenomenal; the dress is extremely comfortable and flattering. i am full-figured and it fit beautifully and was very true to size. this dress would look good on an 18 year old or a 70 year old!
10950	"This is one of the most special dresses i have ever owned -- and i am kind of a dress person. this one has beautiful detailing -- sheer sleeves, but the bodice and bottom half are lined. fits beautifully -- i am a little busty, so i was worried about all the buttons in the front not buttoning or popping open, but in addition to the buttons there are hidden hooks to ensure it stays closed, which is unusual and a reflection of the quality of the dress. i am 5'6"" and the length was just right, abou"
10951	I have been on the search for a perfect lbd for years and have wasted money on dresses that i had to settle for but when i saw this dress i knew it was love at first sight!!! the things i love about this dress: the built in shaper/slip holds your junk in place, the lace detailing is perfect in all the right places, and the button and hook & eye makes you feel secure. great dress that you will love!!
10952	"I do love this dress. i wore it for my 20th anniversary party and received numerous compliments. it's great for embracing your curves. it has a wonderful ""vintage-made-modern"" flair that classic retailer pieces always have. you do have to be careful when wearing it...jewelry or belts may snag the intricate lacework. i am definitely the type of shopper who waits for a sale. this is one of the few pieces i felt i could splurge on. it is just that unique. i hope that retailer continues to carry these t"
10953	The top of this dress is very flattering. there is a lot of fabric on the bottom half of dress. if you want something which hugs curves ,this is not it. however, one of the things i like about this dress is, it can be dressed up or down. i wore to a wedding and got several compliments. very comfortable
10954	This is a beautiful dress except i expected it to be more flowy. the fabric is much more stuff than i thought it would be.
10955	I had been looking at this dress on-line hoping for a pop-back and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size. i found the colors and print a bit blah (i felt like it could use a little detail for the price...bead detail or embroidery) in real life and i didn't love the fabric, in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and doesn't drape particularly well. things got worse in the dressing room...it was a disaster on me. i'm busty and while the top fit, because
10956	Super cute! no complaints! fun print! light weight soft material!
10957	The moment i saw this, i knew i had to try it on. it's a definite power dress - made me feel like marvel's agent carter! i could take over the world in this dress. planning to wear it to work, more casually, and as my holiday party dress. it's easy to dress up or down and is incredibly comfortable.
10958	Read all the reviews i didn't really understand that it really had real shape wear in the skirt. i live in florida and found the dress to be too confining and hot. i would never get any wear out of it. much better for someone up north. had to return it.
10959	Saw this on line and bought right away! perfect romper for summer- color is great and fabric is soft- like all cloth and stone chambray. it fits pretty true to size, maybe a little small when putting on, but i think it will stretch out a little. i didn't want it baggy. fits great through hips and booty looks good! i will wear with flip flops, sandals, or wedge. i also got 15% off which made deal even better!
10960	I love the fit of this dress! the fabric is thick and the shape of it is so adorable. i usually don't like bright colors, but i got it in red and it's just so charming. can't wait to wear it out!
10961	Just received and tried it on right away. really flattering fit and comfortable! unusual neckline that you can wear plain or accessorize. i'm so happy i decided to take a chance on this one!
10962	This dress ladies is simply amazing and perfect!!!
10963	This dress is absolutely fantastic. beautiful, high-quality, and fits like a glove. even better than i could have imagined.
10964	Because of how much i have been buying recently, i didn't *want* to like this dress. i just tried it on because it's such a classic dress. i'll probably wear it all year-round, dress it up or down, and it'll probably last for ages. so i tried it and it's cute. and flattering. and practical. and the scallop neckline in the back is just enough of a tease to be fun without being too obvious. (it does get a bit cold though so adding a scarf is recommended, though maybe not the davy crockett one the
10965	"I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing, i love knits, and i have loved other maeve dresses. however, i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model, to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.  for reference, i am 5'5"", slender and small-boned but also curvy (hourglass). my bust is 36 c, hips about 37-38. i normally wear a small in maeve dresses. maybe it's j"
10966	Love the print and was looking forward to this dress. the length and bust are just right in normal sizing, however the 'swing' effect is all off. there's so much fabric. its like wearing a moo moo. not at all flattering. disappointed in this one.
10967	Tried it on at the local store today, it is very pretty! i believe i runs large. i am usually a small, but they only had an xs and it fit perfectly. it is made of thick linen and has a lining.
10968	The first surprise is that in person, the material is actually kind of woolen? at least, i would definitely call it a winter knit. the colors are also a little different -- so much so that i didn't recognize it in the store. i'm not sure if the one i tried on was stretched out, but it definitely ran large on me. the waistband is elastic, so i would worry about is stretching over time. i would have been curious to see what the petite option looked like on me, as the regular version was longer tha
10969	"I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5'5"", 120 lbs, straight figure, very tiny ""girls"") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the ""swin"
10970	"I absolutely love this dress. it is very body conscious, but has some ""give"" to it. the sleeves and lines are beautiful. very well constructed... sexy without being overtly so. i find it very elegant"
10971	This sweater runs oversized; very soft and comfortable and colors are spot on for fall. love the sleeve length.
10972	The pictures don't do this justice. it's so beautiful on. drapes incredibly. the cream color is a warm, creamy bright off white. looks really nice. incredibly comfortable. i could see this being an excellent item to wear on planes. super cozy and chic. a must have.
10973	"So sad!  this beautiful dress which i have been waiting to receive didn't work for me.  i'm a 5'7"" hourglass girl and it just made me look big!  but i love the pattern and the way it looks on the photo online!  so sad but will return it!0"
10974	I absolutely love this dress. i am 5'0 and 167 pounds and the extra large was way too big. the large was perfect. the fabric is substantial but the fit is loose and swingy so it is good for the atlanta heat and humidity. i want to wear this every day.
10975	I **love** this dress. it's definitely an investment, but well worth the price! i get so many compliments on it every time i wear it, and it can definitely be dressed up or down for casual or formal events.
10976	"I tried this dress in store and was in love immediately! i had to special order a petite size, but fits wonderfully. for me, ran a little large. i'm 5'2"" and 105 and ended up with a petite xxs and it fits great!"
10977	Beautiful skirt, love the colors. so glad i bought this. runs a little big
10978	I really wanted to love this dress. i love the colors and the design of the dress. unfortunately, i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant. it's so voluminous that it's not flattering at all. also agree that the lining is scratchy.
10979	"When i saw this dress online - it was a must have. i preordered immediately and had my fingers crossed that i'd get it! thankfully it did! this dress has blown me away. it exceeds all expectations!!! i ordered an xl which is a normal size for me and i'm glad i did! the body is very swingy but the top is true to size. the print is magical. whimsical, bold,  bohemian and transitional into every single season. i am 5'8 and the dress hits just above my knees. i feel gorgeous in it. the ""woven cotton"
10980	When i saw this i had to have it! i was pleasantly surprised that i was actually able to go down a size (normally a l for the bust) but was able to get into the medium with some room across the chest. it drapes nicely and the inner liner is not tight but flows along with the dress. so many compliments each time i wear it!
10981	This product is incredibly comfy and perfect for getting cozy however the sleeves were sort of loose and did not look cohesive with the grey. props on the draping though, that was lovely.
10982	Oh how i love this dress! i was worried because i am very busty and sometimes that translated to looking pregnant in swing dresses, but this.... incredible! i am wearing it with either blue strappy sandals or red heels and it is quite the perfect summer dress! the material is thick, and feels elegant, the colors are vibrant. today is my first day wearing it, and i have already received 4 compliments! no kidding! wonderful! maeve clothing... i love you!
10983	Was enchanted by this dress from the moment i saw it online. i was able to find it at my local retailer
10984	It looks so cute and i love the detail on this dress but it was not flattering on me. light summer dress and that was exactly what i needed but i had to exchange it with something else.
10985	While i wanted to love this dress, i did not like the scratchy lining. i also did not like that the scratchy lining was considerably smaller than the overall swing of the dress; so it clung to my curves uncomfortably. i wish this had been done in silk, would have been a much nicer material. i returned it.
10986	"This dress is beautiful. it is tts, but since it is so flowy, is not form fitting. i am petite (5'4"" 115lbs) and this is a lot of dress for a shorter/smaller person. if it were less flowy, i would keep it. the design, material and overall product is, however, amazing! this dress would be a beautiful addition to any closet."
10987	This is an amazing dress! it did stretch out a little, so although i got the large, i probably could've gotten the medium. beautiful feel, fully lined, on the really hot days, this is what i grab and i stay cool all day. i get so many compliments on this dress! the colors are gorgeous!
10988	I love this dress. the colors are eye catching. if flows nicely.
10989	"I loved the look of this dress online, and it's everything i hoped and more in person. i'm 5'10"", 155# and pear-shaped. while the bottom of this dress is voluminous, it definitely did not have a pregnant fit on my body shape. the length was absolutely perfect, it wasn't scratchy in the least. i got compliments on the dress all day long. wore with a pair of cowboy boots while wine tasting in napa."
10990	"I'm obsessed with this dress.  it's so pretty and love that it has a lining.  i'm 5'1"" and got a small, i had dry cleaner take it in from the sides so i didn't look swallowed up in dress and now it's perfect.  still has the swing but not as bulky.   can't wait to wear it out!"
10991	"This dress is beautiful and i received so many compliments. it's form fitting but comfortable. it is just the right mix of classy and sexy. you can easily dress it up for a formal occasion or keep it simple. i am 5'6"", 150lb with an athletic build and a size 8 fit perfectly. i will be wearing this dress for years to come."
10992	"I've been looking for a comfortable summer dress with a fun print that i can wear to a variety of occasions, while being able to wear a normal bra. this is it!   it's a cotton/ linen blend, so the fabric has a slightly heavier body to it, which holds the swing shape beautifully, but may have contributed to what some reviewers said makes them look pregnant, and the ""scratchiness"" (from the linen, which doesn't bother me). i'm 5'7"", and find the length to be perfect to show off some legs while b"
10993	Material cheap. too small. good idea for design. love princess cut but bad material. good idea though. sending back
10994	The front material is soft and cozy, but i was surprised to find that the back and the arms were a waffle knit, like long john material, very thin and tight in the arms. cannot wear a shirt underneath it, only tank top. other than that, it's a great deal
10995	It looks like the stores are finally receiving their supply of this really pretty dress. i've been watching its availability online and was getting frustrated. my local store had ample supply. it's a beautiful dress! as per an earlier review, it does run a little large. i love that it's made of cotton so it will be perfect in the summer and beyond. it's a full skirt but looks really pretty on. my local store showed it belted which looked good too.
10996	First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee. i don't know why they do that.... you're not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it's cheap! second, i'm usually a 0-4 in retailer and mine is no where near as loose-fitting as the photo. also, he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit... like a flimsy t-shirt. and see-thru. the sleeves form-fit to my arms so i couldn't layer under it, but i couldn't wear it alone with the fa
10997	"I ordered this beautiful sweater skirt in petite because i'm too short (5'3"") for the asymmetrical hemline. i love the geometric pattern on this skirt and the gold flecked waistband. and the light sweater material make this a perfect skirt for my california fall/winter."
10998	Heavy in weight but not uncomfortable to wear because it's fully lined and has an easy fit that skims without looking like a potato sack! fits a little large but mainly tts. if you're between sizes, then i would size down, unless you're very blessed from the waist down. i am a m/l on top and s/m on bottom and bought the medium. it's a relaxed dress (like a shift suppose to be) that i can wear a turtleneck under without feeling stuffed.
10999	When i saw another shopper holding up this dress for assessment in my local retailer store, i knew i had to have it! i bought it in the red color and it is gorgeous. the fit was perfect...very flattering style. it can be dressed up or down depending on shoes and jewelry, or boots and a scarf! the detail of the scalloped v in the back is a beautiful addition. perfect for the holidays or even dinner out with friends! beautiful dress!
11000	"I was so excited to get this dress; i ordered the red, and it's a beautiful, vibrant, festive color. i am small-busted, 5'3"" and 120 lbs, and i got the regular xs, which fit very well, fitted but not too tight. i normally order petite, but i wanted the dress to hit a little lower on me than on the model; it ended up just above my knee, and i was happy with that. the shape is very flattering and i really like the scallop detail on the back v. the fabric looks substantial but isn't super heavy? an"
11001	Perfect for summer nights. makes any outfit that much special!
11002	This dress is magical. i wore it to a christmas party and felt like the belle of the ball. my dress swirled around me as i spun on the dance floor. later, i spilled a tequila-ginger all over the front. i was devastated, but it almost instantly dried and there are no stains!!! you can't even tell i spilled! it is hand-washable, which is great as well! i am 4'11 and 100lbs. the xxsp fit like a glove.  highly recommend! any other dress would have been ruined but this one was literally magical.
11003	This dress is even better in person! the attention to detail and craftsmanship are amazing. i received compliments all night from total strangers.
11004	This skirt is perfect! it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth. the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch. i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new year's eve and had many compliments! it runs a tad big. i am about 130lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected. i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway. my new favorite!
11005	Very comfortable and cute. i had fallen in love with this in the catalog and when i saw it in the store, i was disappointed. however, after trying it on, i had to have it. very flattering and comfortable.
11006	I just bought this dress today and i'm in love! i can't wait for the wedding i am wearing it to so i can wear it to other fun things too! looks even more amazing in heels.
11007	Ordered this dress and still haven't recieved it, but went to my local store today and tried it on in the size i ordered. it was too big. and now i can't get it in my size. so that stinks! quality was good and the dress was comfortable with stretch. i know in going to have to return it once it comes!
11008	This sweater is a dream come true for me. when i first spotted it during the 40% off sale, i didn't place my order in time to receive one. but then it came back a few weeks later, and i snatched one up! needless to say, the disappointment and wait was well worth it.  the material is incredibly soft, the fit is just about right (i'm a size xs at retailer, without fail, and this was probably the snuggest fit out of all the tops i have).  a few other reviews says that it runs big because of all the e
11009	"I so wanted to like these pants. i wear a lot of ""genie"" pants because they're comfortable. the problem with these is that they're too narrow towards the ankle, but the worst is the fabric. its ""old lady"" fabric. i was hoping for a pair of blousy joggers in a light denim, and this fabric was disgraceful. i knew the minute i saw them that they were going back. i'll keep looking and hoping."
11010	Love everything about this dress! it's true to size , flows nicely, great quality. it's just amazing.
11011	
11012	This dress is beautiful - the pictures do not do it justice. i love the fabric and overall feel of the dress - light and airy. i have very broad shoulders and i did not feel like it look good on me so i am sending it back. too bad for me! i think the dress is perfect for weddings, parties and even everyday wear.
11013	"But it runs super small. i wear a medium for everything but couldn't come close to buttoning this. the buttons were about 4 inches apart (horizontally)  probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit. the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires ""truth in sizing"""
11014	The fabric of this dress is absolutely gorgeous from the design to the colors. i usually wear a size large in most retailer clothing, but i ordered this is l and xl because these dresses tend to disappear fast in the larger sizes. i ended up keeping the xl cause the buttons pulled across the chest on the l. this dress has a slim cut, and i would say if you have a small bust and are slender, this runs true to size. if you have a larger chest, size up because this is the type of dress you want to fl
11015	I wore this dress to a baby shower. it fit nicely and i received many compliments. i liked the weight, it flowed while walking and it was quite sweet.
11016	Love this dress. purchased in white. runs true to size. made well.
11017	"I have been lusting after this dress and though tit would be great for thanksgiving. the fit for me, however, is totally wrong. for reference, i'm 32dd, 5'8"", 140 lbs, and am a s or 4. the small fit well in the body area but felt a little small in my upper arms. the arm length was more of a 3/4 sleeve on me which looked terrible because the sleeves are baggy. the quality felt like it was lacking, too. the material felt like it would pill easily. order with caution."
11018	I am a curvy girl and bought these jeans in a size 31. i don't have stick legs, and the jeans have worn right through were my thighs rub together. with the old pilcro material, this did not happen! this is a super soft jean, and although the fit was good, they just didn't last.
11019	Walked in intending to purchase another jacket and ended up leaving with this one. the color is advertised as grey, but it's actually more like a light mocha. the slightly darker fabric on the side and around the waist accentuated my curves and i believe it would help give the illusion of an hourglass figure to those who are more straight and slender. i generally wear a size 12 and m or l size tops depending on the designer. i purchased the l in this case because that's all that was available at
11020	Where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go??? these are a cheap impersonator. the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half. the last 3 pairs of pilcro stets i've ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally. the pockets on these jeans sit so so low- completely unflattering. the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially. the old stet ankle jeans ha
11021	"This dress is really pretty. i went with the navy, the detail on the bottom is very detailed. it does run very large. i went down two sizes. there is a lot of material and my size made me look like a tent. once i sized down, it was much more flattering and nice. couple details: the slip is strechable and may have to be fitted if you size down, but you can't see it since it's lose on the outer layer. also, you need a different bra since the cut is cloer to the neck revealing the bra straps. i am"
11022	"While it hasn't been cold enough to wear this out, i really like this sweater. i love the pattern with the uneven hem and stripes or bands. it's also super soft and cozy feeling. it does run a little big, and while that is part of the aesthetic, i do wish it was a drop smaller. i ordered my normal top size, medium, and it's a little big/looser, which i don't mind except for the long sleeves. if you like things with a tighter fit i might order a size down.  though it's cashmere, it still seems"
11023	Waist is tight and thighs and legs are not. -not flattering- ankle opening is too small, and they have a funny smell.
11024	"This is such a pretty romper! i love the fabric. unfortunately, it's pretty roomy and the cut didn't flatter my figure.. the straps are adjustable which is great. but, even so, the xs was still a tad too big on the sides. for reference, i'm 126 lbs, 5' 6"", and a 34b chest. the cut of the butt & thighs is also quite generous. stylistically, this adds to the design and looks cool...if you have a few curves to fill it out. i have slim hips and not much of a butt so it looked a little ""dumpy"" on me."
11025	For a couple weeks, i debated making this purchase. in fear that my size would no longer be available, i ordered this lovely top. when it arrived, i was immediately disappointed with its colors...unlike the vibrant colors in the photo, the top's colors were dull...more a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender. had the fit been better, i would have kept this item despite of its color. it's cut weird! though it runs slightly large, i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and
11026	I love this top but make sure to size down! i am usually a small in blouses and the size s was like a tent! returned for an xs. overall, the fabric is a great quality and the colors are stunning. the orange isn't too harsh. a keeper for sure!
11027	
11028	This top is really pretty & i think i will be happy when i pull it out in the spring to wear it. the only complaint is that the front is very sheer. you have to wear an under shirt of some kind.
11029	I like the warm neutral color of this piece and the figure-skimming shape with waist definition. it is a soft and warm layering piece. sadly, the sleeves were too long for me and have long zippers at the cuffs so rolling them up didn't work. i wish i had caught this piece while they still had my size in petite!
11030	This is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse, which i also ordered. it's extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse. it added 20 pounds! the print is beautiful. the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail. i ordered size large and am well endowed. steer clear if you have a bust.
11031	Love this top. ..especially the back. the back makes the whole top.
11032	"This dress is gorgeous! the store only had a size 12, so i am waiting for my size 8 to arrive. very pretty navy color.  super cute. love all the embroidery detail. my niece is getting married in june and i can't wait to wear it!. i normally wear a 6 or 8. judging by the fit, i think the 8 will be perfect."
11033	This is a really unique jacket. the suede-like darker fabric is so soft and brings great character to the jacket. i love the neutral color and the fit is true to size. the only minor complaint i have is that the band at the bottom of the jacket flares out a little, making it wider and a little odd looking. but i have learned to ignore this because all of the other features are so awesome! would recommend.
11034	Very pretty dress and nicely made (the embroidery is quite lovely and double lining, as mentioned by the other reviewers, is awesome), but not a good shape for me and my hourglass figure. like a lot of swing dresses, it has no structure, and it's not a good look on someone a little busty, as i am. in all honesty, i thought the sack-like shape of the dress made me look 20 lbs heavier than i am. i am a medium, size 6-8, and took the 8 based on the other reviews. i probably could have sized down to
11035	This dress is gorgeous in person and very flattering, but i was surprised at the weight and i found the armholes, especially with the picot edge detail, too tight and a bit irritating. i do have a 32 dd bust, so i'm not sure if that was the problem, but i've never had that problem in any of the retailer dresses i've purchased in the last few years. (and there were a lot of them.) i tried on my regular petite small and that was the correct size.
11036	I'm always scared of rompers because of my height and long legs. but this one was perfect. it didn't ride up or hit in a weird spot on the hips. it's very flattering.
11037	This top is absolutely gorgeous! it fits true to size to slightly large. i'd say size down if you are between sizes. it has a nice weight to it - not too heavy, but for a winter season top - it is not too thin. colors are as pictured. i can pair this with black pants or with skinny jeans. it is a top that i will wear for years to come.
11038	This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just didn't look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite, short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress.
11039	Loved this jumper, i usually wear between a small and a medium in retailer (with jumpers it's mainly because of my hips and where the midline sits on my stomach), so thought this one would probably be a medium. but it was definitely baggy/lose. otherwise i would've totally kept it!
11040	"I love this jumpsuit! i ordered it unsure, but i am so glad i did! it is super comfy and fit perfectly. i loved the length...can dress up or down. it is super flattering as well as i am curvy on the bottom and was told i looked ""trim"". my mom, friends, and complete strangers complimented me when i wore this...and that's when you know you scored."
11041	"Ordered this online in a petite 4. (i'm 5'3""/130#). fits very nicely but for the amount of fabric this dress has (3 layers total), i think a 2p will be a better choice and not look as full, maybe a little more fitted, which will be more attractive at the top on me.  however, the detailing on the dress is really beautiful and high quality. the dress has quite a bit of weight to it with the top swingy layer, a tulle like layer for shape and then the sheath like slip. the colors are all very dark"
11042	Love this striped top! it's perfect to throw on with black skinnies and a denim jacket or long grey cardigan. it also pairs well with camel. it is super soft. runs big imo, even though other reviewers said small. like most bordeaux, i took an xs, whereas i wear a small in most other retailer brands. similar to the photo, although much looser on me.
11043	This jacket has been a fun addition to my wardrobe. it has a very cute fit, and i like that it pulls in a bit at the sides to give it a form fitted look. best of all it stretches well despite the form fit; you can cross your arms or raise them up and you don't feel like your movement is restricted. i really like the soft suede-like material on the inside of the arms and the sides of the jacket. it fits true to size. can be worn casual or dressed up a bit. highly recommend!
11044	"I've been eyeing this dress for a while now. i decided to purchase it in the rose color, which has absolutely beautiful embroidery. here's why i will most likely return this dress: i'm 5'7"" and it is very short on me (almost like a long shirt), it is extremely roomy, so it doesn't flatter me in any way. if it belt it, it gets even shorter, and the embroidery gets a bit lost in the folds. i'm sad to return it, but i will wait for the next wow piece rather than have this sit in my closet."
11045	"I'm seriously in awe of this fun dress! the beading, fuzzy flowers and embroidery on the peachy dress make me very happy. it's nice to wear by itself with a simple necklace but i love it more with my cropped jackets--my dark denim for a casual air or the tailored tuxedo black for date night! like others have said, this dress has many layers and is surprisingly heavy. definitely not for hot humid weather or i'd melt and cry.    thank you so much to the reviewer who advised sizing up for the ar"
11046	"Stunning, beautiful, elegant, comfortable and all silk!  the print is very mesmerizing, as are all the hemant & nandita pieces i own.  i'm shocked that there aren't more reviews.  i found this fit perfectly on my body, skimming over my flaws and keeping my temperature moderate.  i am 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 and purchased size mp.  please retailer, offer the other versions of this dress as shown on the uk retailer site."
11047	I love this with skinny jeans! it is comfortable and soft. it fits well.
11048	Can be dressed up or down. details are pretty without being gaudy. i got an 00p which fits well - i can wear it with a belt to give it some shape too. love it!
11049	This is such a cute jumper! i bought it to wear to a beach wedding. i took a chance trying on a medium (i'm a true large) and was pleasantly surprised by how well it fit! very excited to add this to my spring/summer repertoire!
11050	I am 5'4, so i feel i'm on the cusp of petite/regular sizing. i ordered 2p, (about 125-130lbs), and the dress fit perfectly. it's so pretty (i got blue), i ordered this for my upcoming trip for our anniversary...i feel like i can wear with sandals or heels, with leggings or no leggings. beautifully made. kind of pricey, but worth it.
11051	"I received tons of compliments on this adorable jumper and felt like i was wearing comfy pajamas. i wore it to a baby shower and it was a hit. i'm 5'4"" and it was a bit long and needed to be hemmed, otherwise it's perfect!"
11052	I really love this dress. it runs very true to size and is nice and long, but could be easily hemmed. i am 5'10' and have room for heels. the waist runs just slightly high and causes a slight flare out of the fabric at the hips but it is not a deal breaker. the cotton is super light weight and perfect for summer. some jersey fabric maxi 's can be super hot. i was surprised by the cost for the actual quality of the dress.
11053	I originally ordered this top in the black and it's been on back order for a month. i decided to go ahead and try the wine and i am so glad that i did!  the fit is flattering with a longer peplum to accommodate my long torso, the fabric is a nice mid weight with a very subtle brocade  pattern. the back of the neck has a classic zipper detail. the bell sleeves are not too long and the color is gorgeous for fall/winter. i highly recommend this top for all body types.
11054	I had high hopes for this dress, but unfortunately   was disappointed and returned the dress. it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist. it's so odd.
11055	Falls beautifully and the color is vibrant. can be dressed up or worn casually. texture adds even more uniqueness. a little heavy but this is outweighed by its other lovely features.
11056	This is a great pullover. very cute for lounging at home or running errands. it does run large, i ordered an xs & it's pretty big. for reference, i'm 5'7'', 125 lbs & 34 b. it is also a little pricey for lounge wear but i am keeping it because it is so cute.
11057	I just bought this dress on the half off sale price which is practically a steal and i must say i absolutely adore it! it runs pretty tts but all they had available was one size up from my usual 6 so i bought the 8 and it fits just fine (34d-27-35). the color is beautiful and the look of the dress is very vintage 30's/40's and so cute. i didn't find the sleeves to stick out at all on me so maybe i just got lucky and the print is just adorable on this. i highly recommend!
11058	This top fits great. maybe a tad on the large side but not enough to go down a size. i love the fit. the bell sleeves and peplum are so flattering. definitely worth the price too!
11059	I am loving these new leggings and i dont even surf. i just wear them to the gym and at home and to run errands with a cute tunic top etc... they make me feel sunny and happy :) fabric is light and flexible but stays in place (went running in them) size is accurate, i am usually a 2 on retailer pants/skirts, 27 on jeans, and the small was perfect.
11060	"I so wanted to love this dress. i bought it in a size 4 and in both petite and regular, as i'm kind of in between and have a long torso and short legs. anyway, i'm 5'5"" tall and 130 lbs. the regular fit my torso well, and length not was too bad. with heals it might have worked without hemming. here is where it all fell apart. while understand that only really expensive designer clothing can afford to seam a pattern perfectly, i felt that the dot seam in the front of the dress was in a bad place."
11061	"The detail on the fabric of this blouse is beautiful and unique, especially the peachy/pink and orange detailing which is hard to see in the picture. the fabric and seam are quite delicate though so it just needs to be worn and handled with care. fits true to size. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c and the small is perfect."
11062	I love wearing my boatneck pullover. the unique part of this item is the back with buttons. the shirts appears to be inside out, however, its not. its soft, comfortable, stylish and warm. i really like how it's longer in the back.
11063	"These pants are very comfortable i love putting my phone and wallet in the front big pocket so cool the linen is soft fits great the tie dye is very unique love it!"
11064	Fit and flare, pullover style that can easily be dressed up or down. wish other colors were available online!
11065	I bought this top in my usual size large based on other reviews and it fit perfectly.   i have long arms and the sleeves are the perfect length.  the fabric is a slightly stretchy jacquard and very nice quality.   the top is definitely more fitted with a significant amount of fabric at the peplum portion.   i wish that this was a bit less, which is why i only gave it 4 stars.  otherwise, it's a great top for fall that can be dressed up with a pencil skit or more casually with jeans.  definitely
11066	I absolutely adore peplum tops, although some of them are made for individuals with short torsos. this one is beautifully designed with a long torso and flowing wrists. there is a nice balance between the fitted torso and then the flowing peplum and sleeves. the best thing of all is the fabric, which is a stretchy mid-weight jacquard. it is easy to get on, with a zipper in the back. i am sure i will get a lot of use out of this as the weather turns cooler and i plan on pairing it with pencil ski
11067	The color and pattern are so cute and fun. they are also very soft and comfortable. most important, these pants still keep everything covered when i bend into a forward fold.
11068	Tried it on at the store. (must of been a return) at first i wasn't thrilled with this dress.. have a little bit of a pouch and would never think i could wear a tight dress like this. the cut was perfect for that imperfect belly. went to a 5 hour dinner that night and was so comfortable. not itchy and i felt very pretty in it. husband loved it and was happy for me to show my curves again. would not of ordered this online, so glad it was in store. much more vibrant in person . try it you will lik
11069	I am not a fan of sweater dresses and did not pay attention to this one when looking at it on-line. however, it immediately caught my attention in a store, i decided to put it on and the dress looked amazing. soft, warm, skin hugging material, long skinny sleeves and more importantly, i looked amazing in this dress.i think colors are more vibrant, design is more lively in person than in picture. i am 5'10'' 145lb, so i loved that intricate dress pattern, broken lines in front made me not look li
11070	"Great strapless maxi. purchased for a late august wedding being held at a yacht club, will fit the nautical theme perfectly.  i'm typically a size 8 and ordered the medium size -- fit is a little snug on top for my 34dd chest but waist and hips are spot on.  length is long, totally skims the floor for my 5'6"" height.  i plan on wearing it with red patent leather wedges so it'll help keep the hem off the floor and make me look longer.  quality is outstanding, strong zipper, quality fabric, excell"
11071	"This dress looks amazing on-line. in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out, and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake. too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering. pattern is dizzying in person.   very thin multi layer dress. should be better material and quality for this price. save your money and shipping."
11072	Very pleased with this vibrant and colorful sweater dress. the color combinations are very beautiful and it seems as if the threads used have an inherent shimmer. the fit is body skimming without highlighting trouble spots. i am a m/l on top and a s/m on bottom and the size medium fits perfectly. the cut adds the illusion of proportion to my disproportionate body. there are some problems but workable: slip is sewn-in which i wish was detachable; the scoop neck is too low for my 36ddd bust; weave
11073	Lightweight, soft cotton top and shorts. i think it's meant to be a beach cover-up but i'm wearing it as a thin, light-weight summer outfit on these hot hot days. the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didn't realize when i ordered it, but i like it and it matches the look in the photos. and the shorts are very low-cut - don't expect them up around your waist. again, i like that. some might want to wear a cami underneath because it's a thin cotton but i'm fine as-is. i bought it i
11074	I got the shirt, the cami, and the shorts and they are all great. super comfortable fabric, really well made, and really cute. love them all!
11075	Very flattering, sliming and feminine. i particularly like the flutter sleeves. the fabric is a nice weight for fall.
11076	I probably would have never purchased this blouse is i had only seen it online. but i was at our local store looking for something else and spotted it hanging all the way on the other end of the store. a salesperson encouraged me to try it on and it is beautiful! it can easily be dressed up or down. you can tie the bow in multiple ways or leave it hanging. it is sheer but the pattern obscures the transparency so no camisole is needed. it embraces the 70's vibe in a modern way. i absolutely love
11077	Love the fit and feel of these. and super stylish too. i want in more colors if i can get it.
11078	I love this peasant top! i didn't expect it to be made from such nice fabric. usually, i have to wear a camisole under a lot of retailer tops, but not this one! i bought a petite xs and if fits perfectly. thank you to retailer for selling petite clothes.
11079	I just purchased this at my local retailer..the online pix does not do it justice! so pretty & delicate..casual, comfortable fitting..hits right at the hips...
11080	These run so small!! i was dissapointed with having to return my pair. i'm hoping they are replenished back in stock so i can get the proper size.
11081	"I ordered both the black & the dark grey, the dark grey arrived first! they are very comfortable & flattering! there is a nice thigh slimming effect. i purchased the size small, regular length & they hit me at my ankle (5,5"", 130lbs), i can't wait for the second pair to arrive!"
11082	These leggings are great in quality and are thick enough to wear as pants; the rise is perfect. the only issue is that they stretch during wear and end up being a size larger.
11083	I've been looking for the right leggings that are of good quality, thick enough to feel appropriately covered, and a good price point - these are those leggings! need more!
11084	I'd describe these as a hybrid pant/legging. they are very comfortable flattering, and versatile. i got the large because medium was sold out, but they fit nice, not super tight.
11085	"A whim of a purchase on a tops sale. i spotted the black, but went for the mauve. it's great in person, fits loosely and hangs nicely for layering. i will buy the black too when in goes on sale. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame, and the small was perfect (and every a little roomy) on me."
11086	"Love the shape of this top. i bought in white and a friend bought in the neutral pink. we both required a tank/cami to layer under it. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small."
11087	Great fabric.  nice legging, substantial fabric, more structured than a typical legging.
11088	"I am torn about this top. on the one hand, it is beautiful in all aspects: flattering cut beautiful detail at neck, victorian neckline ivory color, flattering on most skin tones, including my very pale skin speck of gold in fabric, it is lines with gold thread  bummers: it is see-through, as in you can see through the neck part. the picture online shows a more covered look, i think the model ash a shirt underneath. on me, you really see the skin through. so i will have to try with a nude b"
11089	"Originally ordered a large but it was huge. the medium fit perfectly. i'm 165lbs, 5'7"". lovely material and interesting side details. the sides do come up quite high but a camo or tank underneath does the trick. lots of compliments!!"
11090	Wonderful fit - love that these have a bit of texture to them and the structure is perfect. easy to wear with ankle boots or flats, and thick enough that you don't have to worry about see-through incidents. the only issue that i have is that the elastic in the waistband isn't secured, so it tends to twist around - just a minor annoyance and wouldnt stop me from ordering these in another color!
11091	This blouse is gorgeous on i purchased at my local store i noticed it was $29.99 + 30% = $21.00 omg it's so nice on it's soft and comfortable and the gold threading make it sunning it does run a little small in the chest area
11092	The front cream panel is completely transparent.i didn't purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath.  i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through.
11093	"I'm 5'7"" with a dd bust and this top in a medium doesn't even hit at my hip. i'm not sure why so many of these tops are being made so short! i just purchased another peasant lace top that has the same problem #it ends up being very boxy looking!#. adding a few inches in length would have made this top perfection! debating about ordering a large just to add length but otherwise the tops fits everywhere else ;# it's so pretty though! the lace detail and the nude panel are so delicate and the mater"
11094	These jeans are so adorable and so soft--i really wish they fit! unfortunately, even the next size up was too snug for me.
11095	
11096	I tried this on in the store and decided to order a larger size online. the fabric by the buttons is very thin so any pulling will cause tears the one i tried on in store was shredded by someone else trying it. i'm a 34 dd and bought a 14. before trying it on i noticed the fabric is already pulling a little right out of the package. trying to decide if it is worth keeping or will be destroyed from wearing.   it really is very cute on.
11097	This shirt is a very cute dressed up casual kind of top. the lace detail in the front and the back make a plain, long sleeve black top look elegant. the material on the shirt is pretty light, so it is for fall or spring.
11098	Love this top. the material is so comfy yet it looks dressy. great for a night out with black pants or a skirt. i'm 5ft8inches, 38-27-38 and a small fit perfectly which seems true to retailer sizing. flattering yet hides a little post holiday belly. i wore a nude rackerback bra with the top, and that works perfectly with the design.
11099	Great pair of black pants, a step up from basic leggings. nice weight and a little ribbed detail on the sides. would recommend.
11100	This is the little black dress i've been looking for for years -- great slim fit (runs small -- i usually get sized out but the 00 was a snug fit), eye-catching design. like the other reviewer, i think solid black panels rather than floral brocade would have been classier, but overall a chic dress.
11101	Perfect fit, nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag out after wearing for a short time. good lines in back so they are more dressy than a regular legging.
11102	I love this top, the details at the neck and shoulders are lovely, both front and back. it's also very comfortable and soft, allowing you look nicely dressed while feeling like you are wearing a soft tee-shirt. the sleeves are a good length with some elastic at the cuffs so you can push them up. sadly, it's sold out in in my size online and in the stores, otherwise i would certainly snap it up at the sale price.
11103	This top is beautiful online and in person. i am in no way a large full figured gal, but i did order an xl. reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size. this shirt is horribly tiny in person! the xl regular fit looked like an xs. have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what. will take back. other than fit, the shirt is very beautiful in every way.
11104	Cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it. if you look really close in the photo you can see it.
11105	"I loved this blouse, but had to return. i am 5'2"", 127 lbs. 36d. i found that the blouse was tight in the bust and very wide in the shoulders. the sleeves are puffy, which is fine, but the wideness is from edge of the bib to where the sleeve is attached and therefore the top did not lay flat. if you have wide shoulders and a small bust - this blouse will be perfect for you. i liked the material, it was thin but perfect for a summer nights."
11106	They are a perfect thickness. fits comfortably like leggings but look like a nice pair of office/ outside pant. got them in the grey, am thrilled w the texture. i typically wear a large in pants and they are tts. not see through either. would definitely recommend them.
11107	All the colors are beautiful, the white is a true white. i got the gray one. it runs large, so i would recommend sizing down, unless you plan on layering using thicker fabrics underneath.
11108	Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings. it's hard to see where i would wear them ... sorry but they have to go back.
11109	"After reading the reviews, these leggings seemed to be the best leggings ever. i'm usually not a leggings gal, but decided these might be the ones to take me through winter with long cozy sweaters. i read the profile of those who purchased and were happy with the fit before making my purchase. i'm 5'2"", 134lbs and bought a medium. while they fit nicely through the waist and thighs, from the knees down they're baggy and really don't fit like a legging. in the photo you can see some slack around t"
11110	I love design of this top! it will look beautiful on many body types. the black material is thin, and for my personal level of comfort i will definitely wear a cami under. the details are gorgeous and the neutral colors easy to combine with casual or dressy bottoms. the top ran true to size for me.
11111	"I love almost all tops from retailer, however this one was just enormous. it is beautifully designed, but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldn't believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i would have loved this shirt if it hadn't been so big."
11112	I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee, it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet
11113	This shirt is so stunning. the photo does this shirt no justice. what you can't see from the image are the tiny gold threads that are woven throughout the shirt. they run vertically.and are very subtle and seen only up close. so pretty. also the detail in the chest area is perfect. i love this shirt.
11114	"For an athro top, this is a good price point, especially for such a beautiful piece. it's really just a basic tee, but the lace insets bring it up several notches. and it's much prettier than the picture shows. i think it fits very true to size -- i'm normally a size small and got that size with this (34d, 124 lbs., 5'4"", 36-26-35.). although the lace is very sheer, i really couldn't see my nude bra through it, so don't feel i'll need a cami, because that would ruin the delicate design of this."
11115	I think this is the first peasant top i've found that doesn't fit like a tent! i did size down to a small, although i'm normally between small and medium. i even found that the shape of this top is quite flattering. maybe the darker embroidery helps. i'm very happy with this purchase.
11116	On the hanger i thought this had a chance, but oh geez... puffy sleeves, itchy, metallic thread, lace... what a mess. and thin. and uncomfortable. no, no, no.
11117	Beautiful shirt! i recently purchased this on sale and it has been marked down even further so definitely buy it! it is very pretty with the gold interwoven in the material. the peplum is also not overwhelming. it looks great with a pair of jeans and heels. my husband immediately commented on this shirt and he does not notice anything?
11118	Soooooo cute. fit like a dream. look like regular pants. could dress up or dress down. i bought the grey and the slight herringbone pattern was so adorable. going to buy in the black as well. normally wear size 4-6 got the small and fits perfect.
11119	Love this piece! lots of versatility and the pattern is lovely. wear it alone or with leggings and boots.
11120	I bought this top for my mom for christmas. i wasn't sure if she would like it, but it is really nice in person and she loved it. it fit true to size and can be dressed down, as it is on the model, or dressed up. i am so glad i decided to get this top. highly recommend.
11121	I love this shirt. wore it today and got many compliments. i bought the mauve (looks lilac to me). it's very comfy and long. its got a lovely swing feel which is great for covering my baby belly.
11122	
11123	This is perfection in the color sky. get you one now. you will not regret it. it is super soft and flattering!
11124	Beautiful material and taupe color. the slits are pretty high on both sides, so just be aware of that.
11125	As much as i had wanted this to work for me, it didn't. fabric is not as soft as i had expected and quality is just bad. i purchased this online (on sale at $29.95) and i had envisioned this to be comfy stretchy and swingy with a flow. i sent this back to the store as it didn't seem fit even at the low price.
11126	Yes! i love the color, the fabric and the fit up top. the skirt, however, is very poofy. i am going to let it hang for awhile (it was an online order) and see if some of that relaxes. otherwise, i will need to return it.
11127	Probably the most comfortable jeans i have ever owned. they are more comfortable even than yoga leggings. they look and fit like real jeans while feeling like loungewear. i have nothing negative to say about them.
11128	This dress is as cute as represented in the picture. the adjustable ties on the sides allow your dress to be form fitting or a looser, more casual look. the colors of the dress and the beading are beautiful. the dress looks great paired with a pair of black ankle boots!
11129	I ordered this in white and it's quite sheer. as others have noted, it is really full and it hits at mid-hip which doesn't work on my figure. if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic, or less voluminous, it could have worked but nope.
11130	Awesome fabric, wonderfully flattering cut. love the blue and green colors.
11131	I live in blue jeans - and i'm extremely particular about style, fit, and fabric. an eternal fan of ag, i tried these on the recommendation of a sales association. in the past week - i've dressed them up, dressed them down, and wished i could wear them to work! the wash is an especially versatile shade of indigo. incredibly flattering fit. if you're going to splurge on one essential this season...these paige jeans are definitely a candidate.
11132	Unlike the other reviewer, i found this skirt to run small...very small. i am pear-shaped and always wear a 12 or size 31. the size 12 in this could barely go over my hips and was very snug around the waist. another inch in the zipper would be nice! there is no spandex in this skirt - just cotton - so there isn't any give to the fabric either. i ordered the size 14, which fit like a glove, but i would really like to see if the 16 would be better. embarrassing but i am just worried that with 100%
11133	This is a beautiful dress. i love the bohemian style and flow. works well with dressing up or dressing down. very quality.
11134	I have two pair of these jeans. one at the original length for heels and one hemmed for flats. i'm ordering another pair because i wear them constantly.
11135	So easy to put on for a casual day!  washes great!
11136	I saw this online yesterday and i was in the store today to try it on. i assumed it would look average or below average on me and i could just walk away no problem. by no means am i in the financial bracket to be spending this much money on a jumpsuit, yet here i am at home wearing it as i write this review. it is surprisingly flattering. i am 5 feet tall and have a petite frame so wide leg pants never work on me, but this somehow did without making me look bulky. given my height, it comes to ab
11137	The colors in this dress are beautiful (the green/blue version) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy. i purchased it online and wasn't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown, i really wanted to love it but it's going back.
11138	Super soft and colors are great. i got the navy and plan to wear with white jeans and platforms, similar to the photo. would also look great with black skinny pants. worth it for the sale price.
11139	
11140	I received this coat as a 30th birthday present from my mother and i have to say, this is the best present she has ever bought me. the inside of the jacket is the softest sheerling i've felt and is pure bliss to wear around town. the coat is actually a lot warmer then i expected, which i'm not going to complain about. the print is lovely and i appreciate the faux leather edge on the cuffs, giving it a more finished look. the fit is fantastic. i'm a bit curvy and the cinched waist with the belt g
11141	"I'm in love. the cut, fit, and fabric of this jean have made it my favorite, everyday pair. they're mostly rayon, followed by equal parts polyester and cotton with a touch of spandex thrown in: the right combination for fit, softness, and durability. these hold their shape well, so i don't have to wash them every other time i wear them. the ankle length hits me at the top of my ankle bone. perfect. i'm 5'6"", 125 pounds. ordered size 27."
11142	Beautiful and stylish. looks amazing with my new black suede over the knee boots! i am 4-6 on top and curvy 6-8 on bottom so aline skirt is great (interior slip is tight straight skirt rather than a-line, which dropped one star).
11143	This is an absolutely beautiful dress, but arrived with several holes in it!
11144	"I've been shopping with retailer over 10 years and this is my first review. i almost didn't order after reading negative reviews from petite ladies. i'm 5' 2"" and these jeans are perfection! they look amazing with a 2-3 inch heel. i don't think they are meant to wear with flats since petite people look ridiculous in flats with boot cut or wide leg anyway. love these!"
11145	"I ordered this in a medium and although the details/design of the shirt were cute, the ""swing"" did not work for me this time around. i typically like looser fitting tops, but with this shirt i felt like there was just too much material and made me feel like i was wearing a tent."
11146	I ordered this dress online in 8 p in the orange color. the length was perfect but the dress seemed big. it was a lot of dress. so i went into the store and tried on a regular 6, but the dress was a little long. they didn&#39;t have petite in stock so they had it shipped to me and it fit perfectly! i am 5&#39;3 and 150 pounds. i don&#39;t think this dress would work if you have a big bust, i&#39;m a 36b so it fits nicely around the chest area. the length of the dress was also perfect!
11147	Classy tunic can be worn with jeans or leggings. neckline is small but stretches so it goes on easily. color is perfect for spring. my only word of caution.....the design can add a bit of bulk around the middle so probably not your best bet if you are tummy conscious.
11148	My favorite shirt!!! i wear it when i don't want to be in the sun too long, it has breathable material in the armpit. i loved so much ordered in other colors. i wish they would make in more colors!
11149	Really pretty color, light, breathable fabric and i love the high neck on this tunic! i wear this tunic with black leggings, a black tank and black sandals. i'm not the smallest girl so i love that this tunic is a bit longer and has a bit of a belt. wonderful pick up!
11150	This looks awesome with leggings / jeggings and booties or slip ons. great buy. its a wee big, but there are slits up the sides pretty high.
11151	I absolutely love this jacket! it's one of the best things i've bought this season. the interior is so unbelievably soft. i just want to wrap myself in it with nothing but a tank top on underneath so i can really feel the texture against my skin. the fit is beautiful, as is the pattern. it's even better in person than in the photo. it is pricey, but for the longevity and pleasure that i can imagine myself getting out of it, it's well worth it.
11152	I tried hard to make this work because it is beautiful, but ended up returning it. first, it is very delicate material - i was terrified trying it on. second, i just couldn't make the drawstring work for me to achieve the fit i wanted. third, it was too low for me and would need a cami over the slip. while i didn't think the colors were as deep as the picture, it was still pretty. i could have possibly gone down a size to fix some of my concerns, but then i know it would have been too short for
11153	I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun, but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline
11154	Adorable skirt! thought it would be snug so ordered up, but had to send back and re-order in normal size. fits perfect. found it to be slimming on the backside, yay! :) this will be a wardrobe staple for many years to come!
11155	In the fall, i purchased every single color of the left of center swing top. long sleeve, great colors and very easy to wear. when i saw these, i swooned. these are very similar knit to the left of center, but the swing is bigger and the linen insets on the side make this easy top even more beautiful! these run true to size...basically you are only fitting your arms and chest. this top will definitely has a little give with wear, which will just add to the shape and effortlessness. the linen ins
11156	I was looking for a new spring/summer tee that still gave coverage for chillier mornings and nights and this is it. it has a nice swing to it that isn't too wide (think a flattering a-line cut that has some movement towards the bottom hem.) it is fitted and flattering where it needs to be (the shoulders and ribcage run fitted and tts which means you don't get lost in the top. it's not boxy or oversized, but if you want a fitted and more flattering look, you can definitely size down easily, parti
11157	I love this shirt - beautiful casual wear, great with jeans!
11158	Highly recommend these jeans! they are ultra-soft and fit your body like a dream. the wash is flattering on them as well. i was looking for a pair of jeans to be my go to and ultimately landed on these. they do runa little big but they do not stretch out much so i went with my usual size.
11159	This is much prettier online than on me. too much dress, even though i sized down.
11160	"I have received several compliments when wearing this sweater. perfect to dress up or dress down. purchased it in black and red. does run on large. i am 5'3"" roughly 110 lbs ordered an xs."
11161	This is a really cute skirt, and it seems well-made (good stitch-work and enough weight to the fabric that i'm not worried about underwear show-through but not too heavy for a summer skirt). i sized up from an 8 to a 10 because it was difficult to get the skirt over my bum. also, the zipper doesn't lay flat when i have it in the back of the skirt so i just shifted it to the side--still looks great imo. i think if you have hips or a booty you might want to size up on this skirt. color is true to
11162	"I have to send the skirt back. i agree with other reviewers who say the slits are extremely high, the ""underskirt"" bunches and the fabric snags easily. additionally, the yarn was already fraying at the top of the slits, and the label was stitched on the outside of the waist band. disappointed in the quality of this skirt, given the pretty steep price."
11163	Side slit goes up far when seated so beware, wear on a non bloated day ;) but very comfy and unforced sexified wore it with a fluffy sweater, lots of looks
11164	Hi , i bought these in moss for both of my daughters. they love them. the material is substantial and washes beautifully. the fit is straight up and down and is not forgiving on figure flaws. i would recommend this to a thin figured girl.
11165	I love this dress and bought it in the store in the orange, without trying it on as i usually wear a 12 in this brand.  the over-dress is beautiful, however the under-slip is very tight and is apparently made for some one who has no bust at all.  i am so sad and am considering returning it or re-sewing the slip in some way so that it fits.  not sure what to do. don't want to spoil the color combo by wearing something different underneath, but it is so sheer you need something.
11166	I read the reviews before i bought this sweater online. one person did mention that the side slits were cut very high, but i had no idea! when i tried the xs on at home i was quite surprised by just how high up those side slits were. with just a pair of jeans, you could see flesh! at first i thought it maybe wouldn't work, but i decided to keep it because everything else about the sweater is lovely. i'll be layering this with a tank underneath. it's a bit quirky and funky and that appeals to me!
11167	I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. as soon as i put this tunic, the right tie loop detached from the garment. i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store. the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product.
11168	This is such a pretty top. i do not feel it runs big, as another review mentioned. to fit the sleeves comfortably (i do not have large arms at all) i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model (a bit more of a tunic fit on me). it is really a pretty top either way, the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer. worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do.
11169	I'm in love with this print! the fabric feels wonderful- this is such a perfect transition dress! the adjustable waist tie makes the dress fit great!
11170	These are literally the most comfortable and the softest jeans i have ever owned. i just got them a few weeks ago and i'm already obsessed with them. they have the perfect amount of stretch that makes them flattering and comfortable but they don't stretch out like all my other jeans do. i ordered my usual size 28 and they fit great! can't recommend these enough!
11171	I had this shirt in mauve and loved it so i ordered it in navy. i love the lightweight material. i love the way it fits. however - all the seams are sewn, quite obviously, inside out. only after i received the navy shirt, where it is extremely obvious, did i check the mauve one. those seams are also inside out but done in a much tidier fashion so that it wasn't really noticable. i was unhappy with the sloppiness of the seams on the navy shirt but, because i love the style and the fit, i kept it.
11172	"This skirt looks cute online but, it has several issues. 1.) the slit is very high, this photo is deceptive, look closely...the slit is actually to her finger tips. you cant wear any kind of spanx or control top tights. 2.) slits on both sides so when you walk they fly away. 3.) the micro mini ""slip"" bunches. 4.) the fine knit is very snag-able. 5.) the skirt is very long. it is going back."
11173	
11174	I love everything about this tunic dress. it's versatile and can be styled a few ways: loose like a shift, blouson when cinched, or eliminate the liner and wear as a layer over whatever you want. all the little details make it stand out and give it a glamorous bohemian vibe. there are tiny beads, sequins and subtle micro pleating. the fabric is airy and quite delicate (be careful.) the drawstrings at the waist are adjustable for both sides. slip is tts and the outer dress has a subtle oversize d
11175	
11176	If you already own at least one of the four versions of the morning glory dress, then you will know what size of the canna swing dress to buy. sleeves are slightly full with button closures. slip is tts and the outer dress is huge! easy to cinch if you want a fit & flare style. just know what you like--complainers about how baggy this dress is are forewarned. those who really want to size down are slim/slender/petite types. if you don't want to wear the tent-like swing style, size down one or tw
11177	"Just received yesterday & i love this skirt! it's crazy soft, very flow-y and the higher slits on each side let it be more sexy than hippie-looking which i appreciate. great to pair with a funky pair of tights underneath. sits nicely on your body - hugs your curves.  only annoyance is it's a bit awkward to walk in as the material moves around your legs & gets caught a bit. you definitely have to be conscious of it as you walk.  i bought a m in gray which fit perfectly (i'm 5'9"" & usually a 6). t"
11178	"This tunic is true to size, i ordered the xxs as i am 5'5"", 110 lbs. it fit perfectly and hit me about 4 inches above the knee. similar to model photo (i have long torso). it has a very sparingly done cluster of sparkle sequence. the draw string waist has a tie on each side to adjust length. i actually returned it only because it seemed a little to young a look for me. i was sorry to do so."
11179	I tried the other dresses by this brand and they were short and didn't fit well. but this dress fit better,i bought the orange size 8 and it fit good with a swing to the bottom. for reference i am 5''9 , 34dd and thin and this fit well with some room. this time they got the slip right and its not tight and the length hits right above the knee which give an overall better look plus the long sleeve balances out the dress. i'm going to wear mine with tall brown boots.
11180	I tell everyone i know to try these jeans, that they are so worth the price tag. i've been an ag super fan for years, but i fell in love with paige the moment i tried these on. (i still love ag for their colored and patterned ankle denim and cords.) i have worn these over 50 times without ever having to wash them. (i never understood the idea that you're not supposed to wash denim, but now i realize that it's feasible.) they don't stretch out and still hug me like a second skin - without feeling
11181	In truth, it looks better in the photo. i am sure it was a great value for the money i spent. however, i am keeping it because it will match perfectly with a pair of satin pants i want to wear to holiday parties.
11182	This is a very sexy skirt. very slimming...a great basic long skirt to have in your wardrobe. dress it up or down. the slits are high, so you are exposed like a short shirt.
11183	These paige skinny jeans are lightweight, snug, super soft and extremely flexible allowing for tons of movement. great for dressing up or down and a great addition to any ladies closet.
11184	This color is gorgeous. this could be dressed up or down. great buy!
11185	This top does look better online and one reviewer said. it also looks good in-person but runs small. i usually wear xl, in some cases l. i tried l, it was small so i sent it back for xl. the xl fit perfectly at the top but was tight at the bottom. the bottom pulled at the seams, so i am sending it back. the embroidery itself is very pretty, it is a nice dressy top that can be worn with multiple colored pants or leggings. it just didn't fit me at the bottom. i think it would work better for a lea
11186	I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn't try to buy a dress on line.
11187	These are very cute but very, very stiff. have washed 3x and still not relaxing. not a bad thing but they are a little uncomfortable the first hour of wear. my waist is smaller and generally, have gap in waist to get fit right in hips. super cute with sandals, mules, duck boots.
11188	I think it's a little on the long side and the sleeves are a little tight but otherwise i really like this jacket. it's lightweight for summer and yet more stylish than the other long sleeve things i grab in case i get cold.
11189	As a dancer and yoga enthusiast i have tried my fair share of leggings. these are probably the best i've ever found. pure + good makes top quality, well fitting leggings that do not slide down, shift around, or become see-through regardless of the physicality of your movement. they breathe wonderfully and have survived one washing with no ill-effects. they are high enough in the rise that i never have to worry about revealing anything i don't want, nor do i constantly have to adjust them to keep
11190	"My new favorite cozy and stylish ""go-to"" piece for everything from park with the kiddos to mat class to impromptu financial meetings."
11191	
11192	This jacket is stylish and unique. love the lines and the fit is very flattering.coral is a bit more orange/dk. peach than what i think of as typical coral. fun color for spring. i sized up from my typical s to m.
11193	Love this tank! it's super soft and has a lovely drape. i got 3 colors on sale and am so glad i did!
11194	Lightweight and comfy fabric, very flattering on, except runs a bit big through the body. i normally wear a 12/14 and a l at most stores, but retailer seems to run large on me, so i needed to exchange this for a smaller size as the fabric width on the body was just too much.
11195	The peach color is beautiful on this jacket, and the quality and comfort is perfect. i wear a medium and the sizing was spot-on. i may get in another color if a sale comes around again.
11196	Super soft and stylish. it's a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets. love it. i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small. i'm 5'10 and 142lbs. typically wear a size s, but sometimes have to size up to a m. i got a s. fits great. not too tight. sleeves are plenty long enough. i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work (aka grad school), and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings, but its not too bulky so i can keep it on
11197	"I ordered the xxs, i think retailer has gone on the bigger size again and i went from small to xs to xxs... so true to size in that sense. i love the color (nude), and it is pretty soft and comfortable. the cut is flattering, the cowl neck is pretty, the sleeves are shorter, and the hem is wider (aka swing). this would look totally adorable with my flare or wide leg jeans. i think ti would look nice too with skinnies, if you have leaner legs.  (for reference, 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs)"
11198	
11199	This is what i'd been looking for without even knowing it! it's long without being too long, and most importantly - its soft, not scratchy the way so many winter clothes can be. i wasn't sure if i should order the small or the medium so i went with the medium, and it fits great. the weave is just slightly wide, but not to the point where you have to wear a cami or tee underneath, but the fit is loose enough that you can, if you want to for added warmth. i really like it.
11200	The shirt fits true to size. the length of the top is great: not too short (won't show your midrift when you raise your arms) not too long (this is a shirt not a dress). this is a great top for a casual day in jeans or a flirty day with skirt to dress it up.
11201	This dress is one of a kind! i saw it on sale and immediately snatched it for a very reasonable price. i could not be happier. i've already had the chance to wear it at an event and felt like miss mary from downton abby. very classy and elegant.
11202	This top is gorgeous in person! i'm in love with it! it's perfect for the holiday season. it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit.
11203	I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.
11204	Love, love, love! wish i had gotten this in every color. the absolute most perfect tank with just the right amount of flow. i am 5'3 with 34d chest and the medium is great.
11205	This top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure. i have 36ddd boobs and a muscular, curvy frame. this top adds about 20lbs.
11206	"Wow. had to check label to see if a m was shipped by accident.  nice details.   too bad!"
11207	Great jacket for a cool morning. not too heavy and i found it to run true to size. nice little details.
11208	Cute tank, runs big. i purchased the mango and it's a bit sheer.
11209	This tank is wonderful for those with full hips because it hangs just right to cover any flaws. the colors are bright and the material is soft. there is a band at the end that elevates the tank so you can wear it out if you would like. not too low in the front and overall the tank runs true to size. i suppose if you wanted a tighter fit you could size down 1 size, but i like the way it hangs in my regular size. i'm very busty and hippy and this top makes both look slim. highly recommend.
11210	"I just got it in the mail and i love it! very versatile piece. wear with skinny jeans and heels or tucked into a skirt. i usually wear a size small but went with what the other review said about a small being tailored and got the medium so i could tuck the front into jeans. i am 5'5"" ,125lbs , a 32dd and wear a size 4 or 27 in jeans."
11211	"This top is so soft and luxuriously comfy! i love wearing it around the house, haven't really ""dressed"" it up yet with jeans or jewelry. it runs slightly big, but if you like the oversized look, this is definitely perfect."
11212	I bought this tank to wear with the pilcro linen wide leg pants in navy. what a great outfit! this tank is very flowy, but not overly large, and hangs beautifully over pants. it's casual, yet can be worn under a nice sweater or jacket and look great. i bought the white and had no issues with transparency when i wore a nude colored bra. i bought it in s and could've gone with an xs but didn't want it to be tight. i'm going back to my local retailer store today to buy it in at least one other color.
11213	Low waisted, weird liner.
11214	
11215	"Had the same inconsistent sizing issue in coral as miss janeausten. i ordered 2 corals, one in s & one in xs & the s was very much smaller than the xs as i could barely get my arms into the s (while my arms were loose in the xs). keeping the ""larger than s"" xs coral - the color is just lovely. also ordered the ivory in both ps & pm & keeping the pm as i like the longer arm length to cover my hands (for sun protection when i want/need). because you can cinch the waist tightly, a looser jacket sti"
11216	"I am 5'4"", 170lbs, 34dd and a medium fits beautifully in this top. the mint green is very pretty, and a nude bra under it works without showing and without it being see-thru. it is super soft and pretty, and doesn't cling. i love it!"
11217	I just received them (blue) and wore them today. i got so many compliments! they are comfy and very flattering. i would not call the fabric cheap at all. it is super soft and washes and wears nicely. i ordered the medium and they fit perfectly, even though i am on the large side of medium. i'm ordering the other color right now!
11218	
11219	I purchased both the coral and cream. the coral is more rustic than vibrant and to me, more orange than a true coral. but for summer, is probably super cute. i found this ran large. for reference, i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small, my usual size in retailer. i kept the small in the cream but if i were to keep the coral, i would have sized down to xs. you can adjust a little, but the arms were loose and coral didn't look as good if not fitted. super cute with jeans and a tee, with yoga pants,
11220	"I'm: 34a, 125 lbs, 5'8"" purchased: small  jacket fits well and is not too heavy. didn't feel tight in the arms. great to wear on a cool spring day! i bought the white and grey jacket."
11221	This is a great shirt but it was big for its size. i'm also short so maybe the petite size would have fit me better
11222	This tank top is great under cardigans or worn over shorts. the pocket and the seam along the bottom give it enough detail to be worn as a stand alone, but not too much to overshadow a stylish sweater layered over it. i bought the white one in the store in a medium and it fit great. then i purchased two more online (mango and pink) in the same size and they run a bit smaller than the one in the store. i thought the mango was a soft yellow from the photo online but it's pretty bright, as is the p
11223	Had to take a needle and pull threads to the back so not visible and i see this as an ongoing problem.
11224	This caught my eye in the store last week, and i decided to try it on. it's the perfect lightweight jacket. the photos here show it as activewear, but i think the details on it allow it to be much more versatile. it's very flattering and i found it to run true to size.
11225	I ordered the orange color too. these are perfect for throwing on over workout clothes and then running errands.
11226	"I'm all over this trend, but this vest is quite thick/poufy, and on me i feel like it triangles out and all you see is furball. i love it - but i think you need some height for this to look its best. on me, a sweater vest would perhaps be better. i am chesty. but i cant decide. its really cute! if you're taller than 5'4"" don't hesitate."
11227	Great top, lately i've been sizing down from my usual xs to xxs with pure & good tops, but in this one the xs was best. i bought this in 3 colors and they're my go to tanks for summer. the mint is a bit sheer, but not bad. i did not get try the yellow or white one.
11228	Close but no cigar...  the design and color were cute.  the sweater itself was too warm for me, and itchy.  the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom, it almost had strange fold in the front.  look closely at some of the photos and you'll see what i mean.  sadly it went back.
11229	Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also, they run very big..!
11230	This is the perfect simple tank for summer. not clingy, and hangs really nicely, but not so billowy that you can't layer a nice wrap or cardigan over it. fabric feels like a great quality. i got it in white, and it's a bit sheer, but i typically layer my tanks anyway. tempted to get this in every color!
11231	I'm an xl in all retailer tops, and sometimes the xl are still too small to fit loosely; i don't like to wear tight clothes. having said that, i had to purchase this top in a size small because it was just cut so large. the sleeves hang a bit odd if you don't get the correct size. i love the feel of the blouse, the fabric is a nice quality. i recommend giving it a try but have patience during the process of figuring out the size that will look best on you in this blouse.
11232	Love this tank. it's nice and loose and looks great with all kinds of bottoms. it's very forgiving if you have a midsection. it's soft, and great colors. really nice for spring casual looks.
11233	Bought this in the turquoise color and it is awesome. for those worried about it being see-through, i'm wearing a black bra and you can't see it. it's the perfect weight. super bummed that the green is sold out but may check in stores.
11234	The colors are beautiful
11235	I bought this on sale and at the sale price it is a steal. great style, feel, and fit. maybe wouldn't feel as good about it at full price, but wish i had one is every color!
11236	"I ordered both the green and the pink and needed the extra extra small petite in the shirt to make it work for me   nice light material cute fit   unfortunately didn't like the pink color was too bright for me  ( and although i ordered an extra extra small petite they sent me an extra small petite which is just slightly too big )and saw the mango in the store which i also didn't like the color"
11237	I first got the coral one and was so in love with it that i ended up getting the other colors. it's just so cute, flattering, so cute with a long necklace and i just love how the back dips down and covers your butt. i've been heavily contemplating getting a second coral one i'm so worried if something happens to it lol i'm weird like that. it's always the good stuff that can't be replaced
11238	This product is perfect for early fall wear. when the weather is a little cooler a shell worn under it will be fabulous
11239	This is one of the softest shirts ever! i agree with another reviewer about the shirt not worth the original price but once this shirt hit the sale item, totally worth it.
11240	"I love the color and the design of this pant....looks very bohemian. it runs large and it has sort of a ""short"" inside of it that is made of a silky polyester...so, it's not as ""loose"" on the inside as you would think. this ""short"" is not a bad thing...but, it's something that is good to know. i love them and will definitely be wearing them very soon..."
11241	I'm 5'5 130 lbs and tried this on a small at my store and then ordered it in a small petite. i like the petite better even though there isn't much of a difference, the petite is about 28 inches long. it still covers the bum but i was hoping to wear it with shorts and i think it's too long for that. i love the beautiful coral color, received a compliment on the color the first time i wore it. the quality is superb. the only downside is i don't like the way it looks when zipped, it doesn't give mu
11242	Very nice top, like the linen fabric. i ordered my regular size m and its huge. makes me look larger than i am, and i will be returning it. i would like a size s i think, just not a flattering oversize fit for me
11243	"I am so glad that i ordered this top. it is kind of shimmering and looks so pretty in person! it is nicely lined and i love the sweetheart shape at the front. i am 5'2"", 34b, broad shoulder, ordered size s and m, and they both fit quite nicely. the size s is more like a trailered fit on me, while the size m gives more room for my arms and shoulder, also extra length that i can tuck it in my low-raise demin. i ended up keeping size m since i like my tops to fit a bit more flowy. i can see myself"
11244	I live in a hot and humid climate so this tank is perfect for everyday use. you can dress it up or down and the lightweight material keeps you cool. i bought it in 2 colors and may go back for more. i wish i would have found them sooner.
11245	I just received this jacket in the cream color. it is so cute! you can change it from 3/4 to full length sleeves. i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better. in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched. the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper. i love this jacket! it is a good cross over from athletic to cas
11246	I'm glad i listened to my instincts once again regarding maeve maxidress. the stretchiness of this knit jersey fabric allows me to comfortably size down from my usual medium/large since the fabric relaxes so much as you wear it. i adore the color, pattern, slim profile and cut in arm holes. wearing this makes my short self feel statuesque and sofisticated.
11247	
11248	So pretty & comfortable! love it!
11249	The tank top fits well. i usually boarded between a large and an xl and i got a large in this shirt which was perfect. it is kind of thin material so i wear a white tank under it. it's not too big in the armpits which is nice so my bra doesn't show. material is really soft and comfortable. it fits loose but not baggy.
11250	I have several of these tanks from last year and bought new colors this year. i have found the fit to be easy and relaxed, but not baggy. they are very flattering. i wear them thru the fall and winter as layering pieces under sweaters and flannel shirts as well. i was them in cold water, delicate cycle, hang to dry and they are good to go. they have held up well - even the ones that are 2+ years old are still going strong with no holes or tears.
11251	"This fits tts.  it is body-hugging as shown on the model.  the knit is thin, soft with tons of stretch.  i bought the ""navy"" which is the color shown in the photo.  as you can see, it's not really navy.  it's a strange blue that's more like a faded dark mallard blue.  but, it's still blue.  the sleeves are long on me. so you taller girls won't have issues.  the ruffles move and are so fun.  the fabric, however, is not finished off.  it's raw cut material, which is why i gave it 4 stars."
11252	The uniqueness of this top caught my eye online. i normally wld not want a long sleeve top in the summer. a bit warm to wear outside now but i like the casual but unique style of it. it's a top i can wear now but only indoors with a/c. the regular small fits fine. a little oversized & sleeves a little long - as in the pic. the color/style/detaling is exactly as in the pic - no surprises. soft & comfy. a little opaque but a nude bra will work fine. i don't see the need for a tank/cami under it. i
11253	"I bough this top in blue and i really like the color , style and fabric. i also bough the necklace as styled in the photo and they look well together. it's a departure from more tailored clothing for me.  i keep on trying linen tops and up to now, this seems the best cut for linen. as the fabric stretches, it will still fall nicely."
11254	It runs large. loose or oversized tops don't bother me so i thought it would be fine, but this just made me look wider then i am. is thin and too sheer for me as well. it was just so unflattering. i had to return it.
11255	This shirt is nice and flowy. it can be dressed up or down. very lightweight for summer, but the color will work for early fall too.
11256	I ordered the moss green color. i love it! the color is really cool, the length is longer, and the fabric is soft. great summer option!
11257	Ordered online in white, just received it, love i! i wear m in most clothing, size 6 dress, jacket fits perfectly. would love one in the peach color shown in the pic but from the reviews stating it is much deeper in colour decided against it.
11258	"I thought i would need a medium in this top, but it was sold out so i crossed my fingers on a small. it fits very well, much like it fits on the model.. loose and length is good ( and i am not as slender as that model!). i am 5'6"", 140 lbs). the sweetheart neckline dips a little more than i would like in the front....but i will figure that out. the top is really unique and i love the shimmery dots."
11259	Love everything about this top.  the ruffles give the top a great edgy style.  will look great with some skinny jeans and boots.
11260	"Fit review: i ordered the size 27 as i read alexa chung jeans run small, and my usual size in ag stevie is a 26 in cords, 27 in some jeans. . i'm 5'2"", currently 25"" waist, 33"" high hip, 37.25"" at the widest, 29"" inseam. i have more of a pear shape than an hourglass, flatter stomach, bigger upper thighs and bottom. i'm long-waisted and do have some high-rise trousers that look great, which is why i risked paying shipping on these. . the 27 was loose at my natural waist, the jeans measuring 29.5"""
11261	Love! this tank?everyone should own it in every color?it is soft, has a great shape, and is super cute. it goes great with so many of the pants/shorts from retailer as well. summer staple for sure.
11262	Great weekend toss around piece or with gym clothes.  the cut is flattering, yet not tight.  i purchased in 2 colos  b/c i liked it so much and was looking for a piece like this for a very long time! cute with yoga legging, jeans, sweats etc.
11263	I bought this in two colors : the green which i love and the washed out look adds some interest to make this other than a plain tank. i also bought this in white and it is completely see through. i will never understand why designers don't pay attention to how fabric would look as soon as you put a bra on. if you want to wear a tank under your tank then get the lighter colors otherwise i would stick with the green.. honestly debating on whether to buy the bright blue color but i fear it's just n
11264	Beautiful color, gorgeous chic design and great material
11265	"I'm barely 5'4"" and rarely find a maxi that isn't far too long or the other extreme. i prefer mine to just barely reach the ground as opposed to rising 5 inches from the floor for example. this one is perfect with flat sandals. i tried on the 4 and chuckled b/c it was 6"" too long. tried on the 2 and not only was it the perfect length, the bodice fit like a glove. i would say i'm average bust size, always fluctuating but not generally flat-chested. i prefer more conservative sleeveless dresses an"
11266	Love this dress !!
11267	This item is huge. i'm normally a medium, sized down to a small, still massive. couldn't go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest. but the sleeves are very wide, as is the waist. way too much fabric. i had high hopes for this one but it just doesn't work. for reference i love billowy and flowy tops, but this was a tent.
11268	This is the first maxi i purchased this summer. i went with a petite as the regular length would need to be altered and i didn't want to lose some of the pattern on the bottom. it is a beautiful flowy dress. no need for a slip. it has beads on the bodice. i kept the dress but it is tight at the chest area and sizing up wouldn't have made that much of a difference..kinda uncomfortable in the chest area. has yet to be worn so may return..
11269	"This dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front. i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face. all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx. $250 was too much to spend on this."
11270	"I really loved the dress in the picture. it is really nice quality. unfortunately it was really long. i am 5'4 and it was about 8 inches too long. hemming it would have ruined the details of the dress. they were backordered on petites in my size ,so, i just returned it."
11271	Lovely material and the white is like a milky white which i love. it hangs beautifully, irons well and fits great. i am 5'-6, an a cup, 150 lbs and ordered the small. i've already received a lot of compliments on it.
11272	I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer
11273	I loved the design and look to this shirt, but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit, but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.
11274	Just received this in the mail, and i love it! the fit is wide and flowy, but i wouldn't say it runs large... i don't think i could have sized down in the shoulders. perfect easy, breezy fall top. cannot wait to wear it!
11275	"I had a hunch that this would run big based on the style and brand, so ordered an xs instead of my normal s and it was perfect! the fit on me is exactly like the model shot - swingy but still cute and falls nicely. i am 5'7"", 128#, 34a for reference. i got the orange color and would say it is a little more on the reddish/burnt orange side than what is pictured. it's very cute - i'm happy to keep it at the promo price."
11276	Purchased the cream color in my local store. it looks great with jeans or leggings. i've worn it with a bright cami underneath with a couple of buttons open and it looked really cute too. it is very comfortable, runs big, but it's meant to not be fitted. the addition of pockets, (that don't stick out), makes me love it even more! i will be wearing this from fall to spring. great design, retailer!!!
11277	This shirt is just precious! i cannot wait to pair it with a pair of white skinny jeans and wedges in the spring. i'm so in love with it. the detail is just beautiful.
11278	"Beautiful detail in the bodice... but i'm either too short or it's a bit too long for me. ;) have not yet decided if i ""can"" keep it. material is elegant, details are beautiful."
11279	I ordered this online with fingers crossed, in my usual size m. it fits well, albeit a tad snug (although very flattering on my curvy frame). it is an unusual color for me, but i ended up loving it in person where you can really appreciate all the detailed woven patterns in the fabric. there is a slip underneath which ends several inches above the hem.
11280	Seems there was a design defect in this item--sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt. i have pretty thin arms so it's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone. too bad because it's otherwise a very nice top.
11281	"I am an retailer employee. i immediately fell in love with this dress. i tried it on and it was way to long, as always with regular store sizes...i am short 5'0"". i wanted to order but it was backordered for about a month, i ordered it anyway. my husband and i took a mini vacation to chicago over easter weekend and in the miracle mile store they had the dress in my petite size. i was in heaven as they had an awesome petite area in the store there. i purchased a 2 petite which is the size i"
11282	I love this top! i actually didn't read the reviews prior and ordered a small. the retailer tag on mine says small, but the tag in the shirt is xs. it does run large, so the mix-up was fine by me. the style of the shirt is meant to be loose and light. i love it.
11283	I think this blouse looks better in real life than it does on line and i'm glad i decided to try it on. i bought an extra small in the red which i think is the best color. the white looks like a nightgown. too bad there were not more darker fall prints because i would have bought more than one. i think this style would look best on someone that is tall and thin. a petite person might get away with turning it into a dress. i would buy a longer version of this . as it is it is a fun, feminine casu
11284	"This dress is super feminine and pretty, wore to my nephew's birthday party.  fit is spot on - i'm a 34c, 5'7"", and 135 and size 4 fit true to size.  my only complaint is that the dress not come with extra beads.  i only wore once and already lost a bead form the bodice.  for this price range, extra beads should be included."
11285	I love this dress! it flatters so nicely. i'm 5'3 and pretty thin. it hugs all my curves snugly.
11286	"This top looks adorable in the product photos, so i had high hopes. i think i might be too short to pull it off, but like another reviewer said, i found it to be like a tent on me, billowing out in all directions. it was just overall too big on me--i even considered whether i could wear it as a dress, but the sleeves were also too billowy on me. i am 5'4"", 120 lbs and tried the xs."
11287	The color and fabric are really soft and lovely. it runs big so you can get away with a size smaller of even 2 sizes smaller. it would look great paired with leggings and boots and a long sweater coat or with skinny jeans and sandals. this is going to be my new favorite.
11288	Don't listen to other reviews- this runs large not small.  i have a 34d and i usually wear a 4 in most retailer dresses.  therefor after reading the reviews, i ordered a 6.  i was swimming in it.  just ordered a 2p and 2 to see which will fit.  the design is stunning and it's very well made.  i'm hoping for the perfect fit once the dresses arrive.
11289	"This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise, it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.  this one is going back."
11290	Love this top. purchased for family photos and i think it's great. personally i don't think the model shot is doing it justice - it's much prettier in person. runs true to size for retailer. i am a 34d and i purchased a small.
11291	Ordered this dress in an xs, that is the size i usually wear. this runs small, but not only that it is the way it is cut, very small through the hips, thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model, but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!
11292	This tunic is perfection! this tunic will be perfect with jeans or leggings and can be dressed up or be worn casual. it does run big. i am normally a medium/large in shirts and took a medium with room to spare. i probably could have worn a small too, but smalls tend to be tight on my shoulders. this is a must buy!
11293	I am petite, 5'2, and i ordered the xxsp, i think it is so adorable on and looks great with skinny/slim pants or leggings. i do not think it runs that large, it is suppose to be loose and flowy and it looks on me exactly how it looks on the model. i got the gray print and it is quite pretty.
11294	I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made, then it would have been a winner!
11295	Great top for all seasons. hides imperfections, flatters hourglass shapes. and great thickness/weight to fabric. i'm wearing it to a concert with skinny moto jeans and booties! side zip is excellent feature and great quality.
11296	This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.
11297	I love this tunic. purchased the dark orange in medium (i am 5'9 and 140 lbs). tried the small and almost kept it but i felt seams around my arm pits a tad, so went with the medium and glad i did - this top should be comfortable. feels very fall and perfect for casual get-togethers and running around town. only comment is that it is rayon... and for me anyway rayon doesn't wash too well - so we shall see how this one fairs.
11298	I bought this in a large, i'm normally an xl. it is a very large on the bottom. i really like that style so the extra fabric was good. i tried on the white and orange. the white is sheer and i didn't like the fabric as much. the orange way really cute though!
11299	Yes, this runs big but i sized down from med to small and it works. i like the gray/white pattern. received compliments upon first wearing and know i'll wear it often. i knocked off a star because of the rayon fabric which wrinkles so easily. this top always looks rumpled in the back from sitting. still i'm glad to have it in my fall wardrobe.
11300	"This dress is really lovely and the quality seems excellent. the bodice of the dress fits tight and that is why i knocked off one star. i am a 34 a 5'6"" and 123 lbs., ordered the 2, my usual size. the top part is very snug and it hugs tightly around my neck which i don't like. i may try going up a size but it fits so perfectly everywhere else. the length is perfect it just touches the ground, no need to hem it even with flats. the color may be a bit more of a peachy color in person but overall t"
11301	Could not wait for this to come and so disappointed.  first of all, it's not a happy orange, it a darker rust.  second, it is huge.  fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top.  you could go to term in this blouse!  back it goes.  so sad.
11302	Was surprised by the cute factor and great fit. the fabric is soft, it flows perfectly and isn't too long. it covers my rear. no gapping at the chest and i'm large busted. i got a large. the shirt is black and the florals in the pattern are a soft muted white. those little balls are small and more noticeable from the back. looks great under a jean jacket!
11303	I bought two of these in xs. i am 5'11 and 150lbs. i started with the size small but that was to big, so down to a size xs and that was perfect. the color ivory/white is really nice, is not see through (i wear nude bras) and it goes with everything. i also didn't see any loose strings falling out of it like another reviewer said...quality material. the burnt orange is really nice too, perfect for fall. love the pockets. just make sure you size down one or two. i am usually a size medium to a lar
11304	This top has dry clean only. didn't like the fabric. plus mine was a return. i also returned it because the left arm has a hole. now it's for sale again. if your looking to buy a large. don't.
11305	"I love this dress! i'm 5'5"", and it's just long enough to be dramatic and graze my feet without dragging on the ground with flat sandals. the print is lovely and the beading is subtle. as some have mentioned, the neck is high. it's definitely noticeable, but i didn't find it uncomfortable."
11306	Very different. i love the unique design and it is appropriate for various settings .
11307	"Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once.  got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it's a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits."
11308	This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling, it is going back for good. such a shame!
11309	I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece's wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn't get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn't cut, but the top was huge. i really don't understand the sizing of this dress at all.
11310	This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.  it's also not made very well.
11311	This is an awesome shirt! gorgeous quality and design. can be dressed up or down! it runs slightly large i ordered a small. i would still order a small but if you are trying to decide between a small and an extra small i would get the extra small.
11312	My store got this great tunic in white and i loved it so much. perfect tunic length, swingy, detailed...but as soon as i saw the orange option i knew i had to wait for it. i just got it and im in love! the orange print is so lovely. the perfect fall color and the print is timeless. the fabric is light and easy. the fit is definitely bigger, but i usually wear a l or xl in retailer tops and i preferred the xl. i have a lot of curves so i love a top that has some room, but i needed the xl for room i
11313	I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird, slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning
11314	It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
11315	Great fit, wonderfully made, and priced just right.
11316	"I tried this tunic at a store and loved it. i had to buy a much bigger size because the sleeves are so narrow. the 12 fit ok but the sleeves are so tight it hurt. i have normal arms and i am so glad i was at a store to try a bigger size."
11317	Although this is a very lovely dress in the pictures, and it has a lovely quality in person, the shape and orientation of the dress is very awkward. the attached slip makes it tricky to put on, and the sizing between the top and the hips seems inconsistent (tight in the hips, large in the top). not quite for my body type - maybe better for someone with slim hips and a bigger bust.
11318	I think i'll get a lot of wear out of this. you will be able to size down & it will still hide a host of sins. it's very comfortable and stylish.
11319	I bought the silvery blue tunic. it is very light grey with a hint of blue. it is so shapely - coverage without being boxy or maternity-like. it covers your bum perfectly and looks great with a dark pair of skinny jeans. the color can really take you through autumn, winter and even spring depending on where you live. i love the sleeve length, too.
11320	I just received this dress and i'm glad i read previous reviews and ordered a size up. i normally wear an xs or s and ordered a medium it fits perfectly. the color is beautiful and the dress is unique. can't wait to find a special event to wear it.
11321	Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size. i am either a large or xl. i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size. first, the top is huge. i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely. the rest of the top was like a large tent. the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking. in fact, in the store, it was displayed with a jacket over it. online, the orange looks completely different,
11322	This top is exactly as pictured and the fit is perfect. the knit is a nice quality and the embroidery is striking. i can't wait to wear it. it will look great with skinny jeans.
11323	Gorgeous dress, soft + silky material, and flattering on most body types. best purchase i've made at retailer in a long time, i get compliments every time i wear it!
11324	-i normally don't go for these tops because with my hourglass frame and wider hips, it only makes me look wider. however, like others, i was drawn to the fabric and feel.the bottom half really is lovely and looks expensive, and the top half is stretchy an
11325	Love, love, love this top!!!  love the ruffled tiers at the bottom.  love the longer length. the top does indeed run large.  normally i'm between a medium and small but bought the xs.  love the pockets.  the orange color seems like a nicer fabric, and is versatile with both jeans and leggings.
11326	I was headed out of my local retailer store when i spotted this beauty! i had been looking for a dress/tunic like this for some time. i got the lovely soft grey/white combo and it is lovely on. normally an xl in tops from retailer the large in this holding horses tunic fit perfect! also a note for women with bigger arms and shoulders this should work well for you as this is usually a problem for me and not the case with this piece! easily dresses up or down, both jeans and leggings work well
11327	What a beautiful dress! a size 2 fit me perfectly- 5'5 120lbs. i have a small ribcage so it works on me but it might be too tight for someone with a larger one. the fabric is of amazing quality and i was so glad to see there is a liner under the skirt. the top has some delicate beading which looks great but i am concerned it will fall off at some point. i have found that retailer clothing tends to have loose buttons and beading. i have not washed it yet so i am hoping it holds up. otherwise, i am
11328	I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers, but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws, the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck, not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining, this is a spring and early fall dress
11329	I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and was so bummed to see it on backorder online until may! i went to my local store and they had it in stock so i immediately tried it on. i'm not usually a big fan of maxi dresses but this dress is so pretty and the quality is amazing! the fabric is light and airy but not too delicate and the subtle beading on the top adds an extra special touch. the waist is a little high (it's similar to the picture online) but i'm also 5'10 so it mi
11330	This definitely works for you - think fabric, great quality, and i'm 25 weeks and i think i'll be able to use this to the end. got my normal-ish size. would never have kept this if i wasn't pregnant, cause you can definitely accommodate a pregnancy (or maybe go down two sizes if not). this is not my first baby either! love for my pregnancy.
11331	I ordered this dress online and did not realize it had beaded details on the bodice... gorgeous dress - perfect for festival season.
11332	
11333	This looks sooooo much better on, than on the hanger/in the picture. i bought the grey, and it is the most comfortable tunic i've ever worn. it is light, airy, and so easy to wear. i wish it came in more prints/colors, cause i'd buy another one, in a skinny minute! if you don't try this on, you're missing out on a surprisingly awesome wardrobe piece. you can wear it year-round with jeans, pants, a vest, wrap, scarves, leggings, boots, sandals or anything else, and it looks chic and whimsical. go
11334	Great top to dress (further) up or down. it does, however, run large and the straps seem (too) long. if you are a petite you will not be able to wear a regular without alterations.
11335	"Love this maxi! gorgeous print, flowy and romantic. in my opinion runs a bit tight in the chest- i sized up from my usual 6 to an 8 and it was perfect. i am 5'7"" and it was floor length without tripping me up. looks great on darker skin. i am on the fair side (winter skin!) and the beige color down the middle looked flesh-toned and washed me out a bit, but with a tan this dress will be perfect!"
11336	"I bought the orange in xxs petite, and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs.  i like a swing style, but this is a tent. the material in the cream is fairly sheer, and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams. the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric. they rather skew old school maternity in summation. mine are going back."
11337	If you love the boho style then this too is for you. it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans, leggings, sandals, boots, and booties.  i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall. it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws. for reference i'm 5'3 and bought the pm but needed the ps. i have recievied tons of compliments and i'm thinking of getting the silver one too!
11338	"I wanted to love this dress - everything about it was so beautiful - except the fit , the length, the neckline ... i tried on a 4, 6 and petite 4. i'm 5'5"" 130 32dd - the top of the dress runs small/tight - so i needed to try it on without a bra. the length on the regular is to the floor/with the petite to my ankles. the print was beautiful and like in the photo, it flowed nicely but there was just too much fabric - maybe it was just the design for me - it did nothing for my figure at all"
11339	I love this tunic.  it is so comfortable and looks great with leggings and boots.  perfect fall look.
11340	"I was looking for a layering piece to go over leggings or skinny jean to cover my backside. i really like this swingy top. i agree that it does run large but i was looking for something flowy so i love it. the cream is a litttle more sheer than i expected so i'm wearing a cami underneath. maybe being taller 5' 8"" helps it not seem so much like a tent. well made and just what i thought it would be from the website model photo. (i used a 20% coupon so help easy the pain of the price of this top -"
11341	This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.
11342	I visited my local retailer store to purchase a dress and left with two of these tunics.( i love browsing the retailer store, its a feast for my senses)the pavin buttyondown tunics are much more appealing in person.all three feel different due to their color and pattern. to me the burned orange feels like country and fall, the pastel grey one feels spring like and more elegant and the white one feels like summer. they all look very cute on.i did size down and still got the oversize flowing look.this
11343	This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame, it could have been very cute.
11344	I purchased this dress in white and i love the color! i think it's a great casual look and it's really fun to wear. my experience has been that this runs true to size, i'm 5'4, 120 lbs and i ordered a size xs.
11345	I love this poncho! it is flattering (who would have thought i would use that word in the same sentence as a poncho?) and offers enough room for warm clothes underneath.  it is stiffer and thicker than i had originally anticipated, and the material is somewhat itchy so i would recommend long sleeves and clothes with more covering underneath.
11346	Nice, thick material. cream has lining underneath which i appreciated so that it's not sheer in the light.  flattering design
11347	I saw this dress and i thought it would be perfect for that night that you don't feel like wearing just jeans yet you don't want to be overdressed. the dress is 100% cotton and is extremely comfortable. i paired with an open toe wide heeled bootie and a long necklace. the dress has a slight a line bottom but fits close to the body in chest and arms. extremely flattering for all body types and the color is a pretty blue. a dress for all seasons!!!!
11348	Doesn't fit as tight/as slimming as you think it would by looking at the picture, definitely order one size down if you want it to fit tight!
11349	"I love ag jeans. i own several pair, and i think they wash well, and wear well. that being said, i'd never purchased a pair of the ""stevie"" cut before. they have the same quality one would expect from ag, and i like that the ankles aren't true skinny jeans, but have a little width. it's more on-trend for this season. for me, the issue was more with the color. i order pink. when they arrived, they were beautiful in the little plastic bag. my heart skipped a beat. hooray! cute new jeans! except, w"
11350	"Yes, it runs a little large - i usually get a s or m in tops, but for this i bought a s. i am 5'2"", 130 lbs, and i did not get the petite- i feel like the regular hits me at the same area as the model in picture. i went into retailer looking for a dress, and walked out with this vest too - had to have. versatile, stylish, pockets, good quality!"
11351	
11352	Love these pants - they are a perfect color, are of a good weight (i sometimes worry that light-colored pants are going to be see through), and fit wonderfully. they are true to size and are narrow down the leg - perfect for flats, boots, booties, or sandals for summer!
11353	I bought these about a month ago in the sky blue - gorgeous color! i was a little disappointed because they fit bigger than i normally wear my pants, but i decided to keep them anyway. they are the most comfortable pants i've ever worn - butter soft. i have dressed them up with a nice top and suede booties, and also worn casual with a baggy sweater and toms. i highly recommend these pants!
11354	
11355	Pretty color, but i was hoping for a thicker, higher quality material for the price. the material is lightweight and isn't tailored well. looks kind of sloppy.
11356	Found this randomly in the store (online return) and didn't expect to like it but tried it on and fell in love with it. extremely comfortable dress, but also has a unique/special design that makes you feel great wearing it. will be perfect to wear out when don't want to look too dressed up or like trying too hard.
11357	I fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite. it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything. it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me. it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just didn't lay down well, bunching out on the sides in a way i didn't find to be very flattering. so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm, but 3 stars for actual fit on. alas it is going
11358	I fell in love with this poncho at first sight. the colors are neutral so it can be worn with a lot. i'm a typical m and it does run large so i went with a s and it's perfect. long enough to cover leggings and great for the in between seasons. i've worn it at least five times since purchase and get compliments every time.
11359	I love ag jeans and these are fabulous! i can't say enough about how well ag jeans fit and hold up over time. i have several pair. i purchased the royal blue color in the store. they held their shape all day and were super comfy. i decided to purchased two more pairs with the online sale because i know i will be wearing these for a long time.
11360	I love how the white and beige were not see through and actually very forgiving to people with cellulite. love love the fit. highly recommend. i'm always a 30 but in these i even fit into the 29. i would say if you're in between, size down. i love the fit so much that i got the beige and white. highly recommend. hit at my ankle for me at 5'6
11361	I'm super happy with this dress! it's extremely well made, very light and comfortable and the shoulder cutouts are tastefully done. this dress is cotton but doesn't look cheap or too casual; it's one of those rare finds that will look great dressed up or down. this will absolutely work across seasons, with leggings and boots/booties or bare legs and sandals when spring comes around. i do feel like it runs a little large, but again it's 100% cotton so i know there will be some shrinking when wash
11362	Looks better online than in person. material makes it look a little puffy
11363	Got this poncho for christmas and loved it the moment i got it out of the box!! great quality and looks great cant go wrong with this purchase.
11364	I ordered this vest in xxs, since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then, the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big, not artfully drapey.
11365	I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue, but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide, shapeless, and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite, i'm not sure it's worth the price, because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.
11366	I absolutely love ag stevie ankle jeans and own them in three different colors. i'm on the shorter side, so in terms of length i'm able to wear them as regular jeans. the fabric is comfy and stretchy and the range of colors is great for wardrobe diversity and mixing and matching! this particular style is my absolute favorite. although ag jeans are on the pricier side, after i bought my first pair i was a convert. as opposed to other brands, i find that they are a worthwhile investment. as other
11367	I am 5'3 and weigh around 150 and the medium fit me perfectly, hit me just below the knee cap. it's cotton/linen but not as prone to wrinkles as i thought it would be. it's double lined, made from a quality fabric. thicker but still very much breathable. will see how this holds up in kansas city's 95 degree summers but so far mid-80's it's been just fine. i'd definitely recommend this skirt. the only thing that this skirt is missing is pockets!
11368	This vest is a great fall item. the asymmetrical design and unusual buttons really give it interest even though it is black. you could wear it open or closed, both look cute. appears to be high quality.
11369	I bought this dress because i love the cut-out shoulder look and had been wanting to find something with this trend that i'd feel comfortable wearing. the dress fits well and the shoulder cut-out gives it a trendy look. i love the classic navy color. i was originally hesitant to buy it because of the slub material - which i've always thought to be a cheaper, thin cotton. the slub is more substantial than other slub tops i've seen elsewhere, so i was happy about that. still, it is made with slub
11370	I have the t shirt from last year and i love it so could not wait to try the dress. why didn't you make it in petite? it can work with some tailoring but petite sizing esp since this runs on the big side, would have been ideal. love the navy, will try the white. how about some more colors and petite?? please??? more t shirt dresses in general too please!!
11371	I have been looking for a cold shoulder dress for a while, but haven't been able to find anything i really liked. i ordered this and picked it up at the local store. it is very comfortable and seemed a little big at first, so i washed and dried it and it seemed to shrink just a little to fit well. i love the open shoulders. i wore it with gray tights and gray boots for valentine's day and it was perfect for the cold winter weather. i think it is a bit overpriced, but i still love it! it's a nice
11372	"I noticed half of the reviews on here were from women with a slim/straight and/or petite figure. fit-and-flare dresses simply will not work for you; it's the entire purpose behind the ""flare"" shape at the hip. it will be too large for women without wider hips. ------------------------- that said, i found this perfect for me in every way. after having a baby, it's hard to find a dress that fits my more curvy shape where most of my weight fell on the hips and bust. i wish this dress was a tad long"
11373	Very sweet color , will go with everything . soft material . generously sized but cut is meant to be comfy .
11374	Cute colored jeans.  ordered the sky color & when it arrived,  the color was a medium moss green color.  the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them.
11375	I love these jeans! you can dress them up or down.
11376	"Bought them in store and have worn them twice. very flattering! they have maintained their shape through the day. i'm 5/4"" and usually wear a 31"" inseam, and these are perfect ankle length. i'm tempted to buy another color!"
11377	I bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small. i could not even pull the skirt all the way up. returned
11378	Love another pair of ag stevie's!
11379	I purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design. not too fancy but definitely not casual either. easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions. the fit is great, but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly (it truly is fine though). has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel. very comfortable for an evening out.
11380	This vest is very nice and fashionable, very stylish. i like it a lot. however, it is too itchy. the opening in the front didn't allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold. however, the itchiness is too much. i don't wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere, so i could not imaging wearing this vest, it is too itchy. why ruin such a good thing?
11381	"These ag stevie ankle jeans only have 50% cotton.tthe rest is 41% lyocell (a rayon), 7% polyester, and 2% polyurethane. result: thin and clingy jeans that show every lump, and stretch out.  . these are no longer the same lovely ags in twill when they were at 80% cotton, 18% modal, 2% pu. it seems ag has also stopped making denim and corduroy with 98% cotton, at least in the stevies. . i'm sure these will be a great choice for someone looking for very soft and thin pants that feel like pjs, b"
11382	"This is definitely one that looks better on than on the hanger. i am 5'10"" so it is a little too short for me to wear with bare legs (it tends to ride up) but it looks great with boots and tights. i love the raw edges of the striped a-line part. i have also worn it belted and that is also a very cute look."
11383	"The colors are amazing, the fabric is beautiful; my only complaint is the cut. i am 5'8"" 130 lb and always a medium. i put the sweater on and the armhole area was short so it kept riding up- it almost fit like a petite with the higher cut in waist tailoring. i liked the sweater color and fabric so much i exchanged for a large."
11384	"These pants are perfect! they are amazingly comfortable and soft - i could wear them all the time. i'm 5'2"" and have been looking for shorter jeans to wear with ankle booties, which has been pretty tough. i ordered 29 petite and the description said the inseam would be 24"". i don't know if that's true since they fall right at my ankle and usually that's around a 26"" inseam, but definitely a great length and i don't need to hem. the leg opening isn't too big, so i can roll it up/cuff them to get"
11385	I loved the blue brocade since it's a little unusual, paired with a top that brings an otherwise formal fabric into something you could wear out to dinner, plus a little pop of extra color from the ribbon! my biggest fear ordering online was that the top would look cheap - fortunately it doesn't. the top of the dress was fitted (i wore my usual size). what i didn't expect, though, is the skirt is really poofs out a lot below the ribbon, which runs just below the bust. the photo online shows a li
11386	The best thing about these pants is the material. if you are expecting a bleached denim-material, these are not for you. these are far better. they are extremely soft and have some give to them but not so much that they stretch out while wearing them (as guaranteed on the tag). although, because they are a less rigid material, the pants do show stretching as can be seen at the knee area in the photo. if you normally get short-sized pants, the regular fit will fit like regular non-ankle pants but
11387	"I purchased these jeans because they were on sale and i figured they'd be a good alt to my other white denim jeans. these have by far exceeded my expectations! my fav jeans, period. i'm 5'2 1/2"" but have a long torso and though west size 25, am athletic and curvy, so petite jeans don't really work for me. these are just the best cut and fit!"
11388	I was excited to find this on sale because i just love baily 44, their designs are always simple, beautiful, and comfortable, and this one, just like the other 2 baily 44 dresses i own is perfect. i am 5'9, 125 pounds, and 34b bra size and got my usual size, xs. unlike my other baily 44 dresses, this one has a more relaxed fit up top and then has a form fitting layer that shows off your curves on the bottom. i personally don't think it's too short, but then again plan to wear tights with this pi
11389	"Love love love. i tried it on a whim when returning a shipped item. it's gorgeous and incredibly flattering. runs large (it's drapey and would likely look good in your normal size since you can synch the waist, but probably best to size down as it seemed large in the bust size - which isn't an issue i usually run into).   it's quickly become a great staple for work. definitely pair it with bodycon pants/ leggings/ skinny jeans - and it looks unique and very professional."
11390	Just received this, been eyeing it and with free shipping and 15% off (due to online survey i took) i bought it. it's flattering, the color and design is very pretty. i just really like it!
11391	This is the most beautiful dress. i am so happy that i got it. it is very comfortable and the colors are brilliant. it's completely appropriate for a holiday party which is what i got it for and i'll be wearing it to a wedding in may also.
11392	I wasn't all that impressed with this dress on the hanger, but i am so glad i tried it on. it is super comfortable, very flattering, and can be worn multiple ways. spot on!
11393	This dress is such a crazy beautiful color, the picture doesn't do it justice. i ordered this right when i saw it, and i almost love it. the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice, but i just didn't find it flattering at all. the slip wasn't the nicest, but completely not a deal breaker. i didn't think it was overly flattering on the model either, so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway, but something about the way it's cut is just a little off for me. it was very tru
11394	These jeans look great with everything and fit great. i can dress them up with wedges or throw them on with flip flops and they are so comfortable, too. i've had many compliments already.
11395	I try to find something to like about everything i buy, even if it turns out to be a disappointment. for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering. it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt, but unfortunately it was not enough. this shirt is super boxy and runs large. i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this. if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons won't pull at the ch
11396	"This dress looks great on...feminine and swishy! color is bright and the underslip is nicely attached, which i appreciate...no fighting with straps, etc. i ordered a six for my 5'4"", 130 lb, 34dd self and it fits like a dream. the extra 5 lbs i support with lots of food is on my tummy, just to give you an idea of my shape."
11397	I love, love, love this dress! it fits perfectly! it is comfortable and can be dressed up or down. i get compliments on it every time i wear it!
11398	"Not what i was expecting, but pleasantly surprised.  was envisioning a more structured/tailored trouser, but these are closer to leggings, albeit very substantial ones with ""real pant"" touches like a zip/button front and (faux) pockets.  they're form fitting, soft yet supportive, stretchy, incredibly comfortable, and tts.  i'm a pretty legit 10 in pants (30/31), and the 10's near perfect, with the rise coming right to my belly button.  think i'll grab another pair now while they're available."
11399	I'm bought this dress at 16 weeks pregnant and am loving it! the top drapes, but is still form-fitting enough to show off a little bump. i've received so many compliments. the skirt is short, but i love it, makes legs look great with tights! i sized up a little to allow for room to grow.
11400	I ordered this dress to wear to a summer wedding in san francisco. i liked that it had sleeves, a plus. when i was trying it on, i found that it was a little snug, then realized it was the slip, which is not too tight at all once the dress is on. it helps to smooth those little bumps. it is drop waist style, which skims the torso, then flares out prettily. all in all very complimentary, beautiful color, well made. very pleased; it will be comfortable and perfect at the wedding.
11401	I'm 5'5 and curvy body shape, bought size 6 because i want it to be a bit loose, turns out i could go with size 4 too, beautiful detail, and amazing fabric. this come with a crop tank top to go inside the lace blouse.
11402	I decided to splurge. i would not normally spend $200 for a pair of jeans, but when they went on sale, i decided to go for it. i am so glad that i did. mother has a customer for life. these jeans are the best by far. i normally wear a size 4 (27) in most jeans, but wear a 28 in j brand and some others. so i was a little nervous by previous reviewers not just on this website. i decided to go with the 28 since in mother brand this is actually a 4/6. they fit great!
11403	Love this layered turtleneck dress. super cute and super comfy. love the contrastin pattern and fabric of the top half and the skirt. also the skirt is very hip hugging as shown in the photo, with the result being flattering. i wore it to work with sweater tights and boots (winter in seattle) and felt completely put together.
11404	"I love the pattern and style of this top. it is a flattering cut, however, it was way too short. i am 5'6"" and small usually fits me without issue. sadly enough i had to return it."
11405	I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however, in person, it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor.
11406	In the photos i have a different tank underneath than the one that comes with the shirt. i am wearing a medium and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
11407	This is an amazing top. fits perfectly, beautiful detail, and amazing fabric. i actually came back to the site just so i could order it in all available colors, but unfortunately it's only in navy. don't hesitate to buy this!
11408	Like everyone else, i ignored this vest in the store. my mom actually gave it to me to try on and practically forced me to buy it. it wasn't until  i got home that i discovered its versatility. i got it in the beginning of june so haven't been able to wear it much, but fall is quickly approaching and i already have at least ten outfits to wear with it. it's classy and can dress up any outfit.
11409	"Beautiful color and flattering fit on me. i bought the size 4 and it fits my 5'5"" 125 lb frame perfectly. i love that it has sleeves!! no worries about upper arms. it is light and silky even though it is not made of silk. it is elegant and casual at the same time thus versatile. i will wear it to three different weddings this summer and can make it work for the office too. love it. worth every penny.."
11410	Unlike some of the other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size. post pregnancy i am a 6 on top and an 8 on the bottom. ordered a 6 and it is perfect. (140 lbs and 34c) perhaps that's because i'm long waisted and the waistline hits right below my rib cage?  the colors, materials and quality are wonderful. i can see wearing this in the winter and summer. in fact, it will look lovely against sun kissed skin.  one thing, the top portion appeared to be a knit in the pictures online, howeve
11411	"These are great. they fit tts - i'm a 26 in most denim brands & that's the size i got. the material has some give but doesn't stretch out. the color is not super white so you can actually wear them in the colder weather season as well. at 5'4"", they were a little longer on me than shown on the model. i find them very comfortable."
11412	I love this dress. it is so comfortable and easy to wear. i was able to wear it to work and look nice but stylish. it was nice that it isn't too heavy but the turtleneck kept me warm enough.
11413	"I'm a curvy size 8, and these pants fit  beautifully.  they're a fairly narrow (cropped) leg, with a slight flare. i'm happy and ordering another pair."
11414	"Nice soft jeans, cute style, and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i don't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need.  if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they don't fit my body type"
11415	This is a very light, flowy dress. the lining is very fitted, but the dress is actually not fitted. it has a nice flow, but hits right at the thigh area before flowing out. plan to wear it to work.the color is very bright and pretty.
11416	This top is lovely, but fits like a crop top -- and i'm very short-waisted. i wore it with high-waisted jeans and was tugging at it all day. i think it will probably work better with a skirt. the colors are beautiful; it has a nice retro vibe. recommended if you don't mind the crop factor.
11417	"I ordered this on the black friday sale. one reviewer mentions that the fabric is thin, and i ordered it anyway because the design was unique. besides, i have another bailey 44 dress and felt that i knew what to expect on quality. when it arrived, i was pleasantly surprised. while not thick, the fabric is a better quality than my other dress. plus, the style is unique and flattering. i am 5'4"", and it hits 2-3 inches above my knee. i will definitely wear it to work with knee boots!"
11418	This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem, loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it's really too bad, it's such a pretty combination of patterns.
11419	"These cuff jeans are very good looking! 4 stars bc of price. they run small too. i wear 29 in pilcro for ref and these were best for me in a 31. the rise is very short so if you are tall, beware. i'm 5'9"" and the 29 i tried was super uncomfy in the crotch area. i haven't worn them all day yet so they might stretch a bit."
11420	I should have listened to the reviews that said this top was too boxy, but i didn't believe them and bought it anyway. i was wrong! this top is so boxy and wide, just awful.
11421	
11422	I love this dress. it is very cute and comfortable and great for football games / everyday wear. it is a little long, which is great for me since i'm taller.
11423	I've been looking for an off the shoulder trend item and this one fits the bill perfectly. the denim is a nice color and weight, love, love the pockets! the neckline is not too frilly, the sleeves are fluttery but not over the top ruffled. i wore this dress to lunch with cute flat sandals and i must say it looked adorable! sad i didn't find this earlier in the summer, but will wear when i can. my only concern is that it will shrink in length, i'm hoping not. this one will def be taken to the dry
11424	
11425	Super cute basic top but after washing it once according to tag instructions, it is pilling like a well-worn sweater would.
11426	I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small, and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent, instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment, as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.
11427	
11428	"These are nice cords, albeit they look slightly more faded in person. i like the style, high waist, and the cropped flare (which actually fit me perfectly as regular length since i am 5'1""). they do run small. i am normally a 25-26 and the 27 fit perfectly."
11429	Very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big. returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium, it was apparently not available in the medium, i was charged a 5.95 fee for return shopping. so i immediately went to website, medium available and i had to pay another 12.95 for shipping. seems a bit unreasonable, but really liked the dress.
11430	I was pleasantly surprised with this cardigan! i get so many compliments- i can easily see me carrying this into my fall wardrobe!
11431	It is a little pricey for what it is, but i love it so much that i am keeping it. i am normally size 4-6 and the s fits great. the rope straps are just adorable!
11432	This is a really well made, great looking blouse. the details are charming. i like that it is a good weight, not too sheer. the 3/4 sleeves are perfect. i ordered a medium and it is a good fit overall. so glad i put it in my shopping cart to try. it's a keeper!
11433	I really like the style and cute stripes and i love the versatility of the design of this shirt. fits true to size and hides my stomach just in the right places
11434	This ruffle tee is adorable on. the fabric is light but not thin and the styling is very flattering to any figure. i look forward to wearing it as a transition piece as it stays warm long into fall in the south.
11435	"I tried on the xs and the shoulder are fit, but the body seemed so wide on me, it took me over... i don't know if xxs would have worked, but it is not available (and petite either). fabric is soft enough for denim, color is nice, overall, really pretty dress, just unfortunately big.  and i have wide shoulders.  30dd chest, 26.5 in wasit, big legs, 115 lbs."
11436	I think when this is new, it runs big, and then shrinks to the right size. that's what it did for me anyway. it did shrink after one wash, but not significantly. i bought it in m and feel it stayed within that range. super cute with shorts - airy, light. love the white. ordering another color!
11437	I ordered one of each color in size xl. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. there's a lot of material so it's flowy. but, it shrunk with air-drying. the colors are very pretty in person. the white is bright. i decided to keep mine even though they're truthfully, unflattering to wear. the way the sleeves are slightly gathered and cut, make my shoulders & arms look huge. i don't have the shape to pull this off. but, for wearing at home in the summer, they're worth having. the m
11438	"I tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs - both were ridiculously wide. they were also both cut really short - the peplum basically started right below my boobs, though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex. the stripes are really cute, the cut is just very strange.   for reference, the black and white is the small, the taupe is the xxs."
11439	Bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes. had little to no shape to it. some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for. i feel like being short, i just looked kind of dumpy on me. fabric is nice but borders on see through. it was just ok....nothing exciting.
11440	Love the way this looked online/on model. would not recommend for a shorter or curvy person such as myself. it just ended up looking like a very chic potato sack on me, and was not flattering.
11441	"Pros: pretty, nicely made.  cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting, and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don't mean that it is tight or digs in, but it cuts in; you can't tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well, and, as i am curvy, it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure."
11442	"The quality and fabric are fabulous but it's just too voluminous for my figure (5'8"", 155 lbs), would look great on someone more slender."
11443	I am very self conscience of my tummy and this covers it up without being too baggy! there is plenty of room. i originally bought a small then went to an extra small then went back to a small. i wear a small in most things. great nicer looking tee!
11444	This is a vary cute blouse. i ordered both colors in my typical medium, intending to give one to my sister. i couldn't decide what color to keep but went with the black simply because it fit my style better. looks great with dark jeans. the tan stripe is very cute, a little more summery and looked better on the sis than me.
11445	"Cute swing tee! fit for me is perfect. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs and i bought my usual small. length is nice. fits me just at my hips. i can wear to work and on the weekends. a little concerned  the fabric may pill so i'm taking extra care. receive compliments every time i wear either color. love."
11446	These jeans fit perfectly. however, the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste. i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic.
11447	This shirt runs large. i ordered it before it was sold in stores so i didn't return it. the style is really cute. the shirt does pill.
11448	This top is so comfortable and better quality than i expected. ruffles fall nicely over your sholulder and there is a fabric underarm, i don't have to wear a tank top underneath like i normally would with tops with wide opening around arms. color is beautiful too, i really love it. true to size.
11449	I am always searching for effortless items. this is a cute and classic shirt that meets all those requirements. i actually really like the sleeves. it take a basic tee and elevates the style. i bought the teal but am also thinking about ordering the white too. can't go wrong with a classic white tee.
11450	"Material is nice. design would be so great if it didn't fit so large! i am 5'4"" 118lbs, athletic build. the dress could be belted i think (a very slim girl at retailer did this), but it is not worth $158 in my opinion. if on sale i might keep it due to the hastle of returning it, however, it is not ""flowy."" it fits okay in the shoulders, almost too loose, and the rest looks like a potato sack. so disappointed!!"
11451	Nice jeans, just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them. that's why i returned them. otherwise, fine.
11452	I bought the green and white and waiting to see how these wash based on previous reviews. they are definitely not figure flattering and make you a bit boxy. you could belt it, but i won't i'll just wear for errands and lounging, better than my sports tees! i bought mediums because if it shrinks a tad, the small might be too short in the arms and i wanted a bit more arm coverage.
11453	I thought this top would make me look extremely boxy, but i couldn't resist the stripes and the cut of the top. i did size down, and so glad i did! adorable .... fun and flattering! and that's coming from a curvy girl, with a ddd bust. soo soft!!!!
11454	I got this in black and it's a great basic t-shirt- the v-neck is just right in depth, and the material is very soft and lightweight. the fit is good. the back is long, which can be good or not-so-good depending on how you want to wear it. i really like the la t shirts because the material has a nice soft drape and they seem to fit exceptionally well.
11455	I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn't realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it.
11456	"This jumpsuit is fabulous in person! it is elegant and easy and very figure flattering. i have a very curvy shape but a 34 ddd bust so i would say i am a top heavy hourglass. this jumpsuit does me right. the only thing i would say is i don't think it would be very comfortable on a person with a long torso. i am 5'3"" and bought this in 6 regular and the length is perfect with heels. but the whole top half fits me perfectly but shows alot of boob if i'm not careful. but i don't think it would be s"
11457	I love the loose vibe of this top. the bold stripes are super cute. i can dress this up or wear with jeans and sneakers. get this top ladies!
11458	"This top takes every other tee and blows it out of the water! it appears subtle on the hanger, but it looks so lady like on! the flutter sleeve are darling. the top does have a lot of volume, but the drape is so lovely, it adds some shape. it is perfect to wear everyday and dress up! i bought to wear with the bryden skirt. for reference, i purchased ordered the xs (though i am wearing a s in the photo) and i am 34c, 26"" waist. the shoulder fit okay with easter size, but there was a little less v"
11459	I just bought this top in size medium and i love it. super comfortable and flowy. if you want to dry it in the machine, just put cold air and it won't shrink. don't use hot air...
11460	You know how you hope that a dress that you order online is as good as you think it will be? well, this one is better then i had hoped! it fits beautifully. it is crafted beautifully. there is nothing i don't like about it. i was pleasantly surprised at how light the fabric is. i thought it might be a heavier denim, but it is perfect. not so light that you can see through it, but cool and breezy even in the florida heat. do yourself a favor and grab this one before it's gone!
11461	Love this dress! it is very comfortable and stylish. looks great with flats or wedges. material is soft and comfy! definitely worth the price.
11462	Adorable denim dress! fabric is lighter than i imagined but is very flattering. perfect length. this is not a form fitting dress at all so if you're going for that pass on the dress or possibly order a size down.
11463	"This. an unexpected purchase...i found this on my way to the dressing room. the fit is stunning. i sized way down (i.e. normally wear 10/12, curvy, and bought a small). it accentuates my curves, and is incredibly flattering. i bought the navy, and will be adding another color soon! the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy. it's a nice addition to my work wardrobe."
11464	"I am very frustrated. i ordered the pxs and pxxs back in may...at the time they were both on back order until early august. last week i received an email that the pxxs was no longer available. i emailed customer service and got the reply that the shipment of pxxs was damaged and so that's why they were no longer available. i did receive the pxs and while the length is good for me at 5'4"" it is enormous through the entire body (shoulders down to the hemline!) i know the pxxs is the size i needed"
11465	I love these! they are so soft! the high waist is awesome and fits like a glove. they don't stretch out. i wear with a heel and get tons of compliments. they make my hips look smaller than they are.
11466	"The photos online make it look like a comfortable, relaxed, lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no ""shimmer"" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out, but it didn't work. it looks too rumpled and i don't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed."
11467	This is one of my absolute favorite dresses of the season! fun, flirty and fashionable! i wore it with a chunky necklace, floppy hat and sandals one time and with wedges and dangly earrings the other time. it is a must own dress!
11468	I was a little nervous to buy these because they are such a statement piece. but i love them! they are so comfortable which is rare for jeans. they create the optical illusion that i am a super model, so i will wear them as often as possible. very flattering and comfy=win win!
11469	Paige jeans are obviously known for their luxurious feel and amazing fit. these jeans are the best new addition to your collection. the perfect high rise and not as extreme flair, these might beat out your skinny jeans for your nights out. they do come extremely long, so they will most likely need to be hemmed. i get huge compliements when i wear them and told how they compliement my legs in the best way. if you're debating on whether to jump onto the flair trend, i'd go with these!
11470	"Great fit i'm petite and bought size 29. my hips and waist differ by 10"", so i'm very curvy. i love the fit and look just by rolling them up. my 1st pair of ag jeans and i will definitely buy more."
11471	I so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating. it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo. it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses. i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room. in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves. one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns. the lower
11472	"I have been searching for months to find a pair of top-quality, slim fit, high-waisted jeans, either straight leg or flare. my search has ended with these flare jeans from paige, thanks to retailer. the fabric is incredibly soft, yet has that little ""snap"" of stretchiness we have all come to expect in expensive jeans. i also like the dark wash and the fact that there aren't those odd color striations across the hips. i bought size 27, which fits me perfectly. (virtually all my other jeans a"
11473	Lovely blouse-- very well made. i had a baby last year and recently weaned so my bust line is changing-- right now somewhere between a 36d and c. the medium was a little roomy for, i could've easily sized down but i like the airy look so i think i will keep it this size. quality fabric, very comfortable yet dressy. i'd definitely recommend this blouse.
11474	I ordered this in tan and white, but ended up returning it. the material is a bit thin (but soft). the shape of the top was decent, i didn't think it was too boxy but i didn't like how the seams looked on the sides. ultimately i didn't think it was worth the price.
11475	These jeans are buttery soft and very flattering. unlike many jeans these do not ride down my waist as i wear them. i am a bit concerned about them long term as they list rayon as the primary fabric, which means they have to be washed very carefully. still, i highly recommend.
11476	
11477	Nice stretchy shirt. nothing special so i wouldn't pay more than sale price.
11478	I ordered this online. it's fine. i am usually a small in tops and it fits true to the size. good material. no complaints. looks good layered.
11479	Super soft and flattering fit. i'm 5 feet 4 inches and petite was the perfect length.
11480	I love the look and the simplicity of this top! it's very casual, but also super cute. my only issue with it was the fabric started to ball up after a few wears. but i still love it!
11481	I ordered this on-line. i love the sleeves and the pleat in the back, but the top runs large. i ordered a small, but it is too big. other reviews say that the top shrinks when you wash it. however, i'm not sure if the store would let me return a washed item if it doesn't shrink enough for my taste. i think i will probably be returning this top.
11482	
11483	Purchased this top in the store on sale. love the material. very soft and comfortable. love the black and white combination. i am petite so the top is a great length on me. i can see that if you are tall it might be to short.
11484	"I received this tank today and i fell in love with it immediately! i am petite (5'3""/36b/108 lbs) and purchased this in the only size left, which was a small. yes....it is very billowy (but i do a half tuck into my pants and that solves the problem perfectly and looks great!!) i have very well toned arms and the way this is cut just accentuatea this! yay!! the fabric is soft and the overall look is super feminine!!! so very happy with my purchase! plan on wearing with jeans shorts/cropped jeans/"
11485	Fits like a dream. i have a thick middle and tend to have problems with anything that flairs out, so i was so happy that it hung beautifully on me. even though i wasn't really looking for a sweater to take on a trip to europe in a few weeks, i bought it on the spot. i bought it in neutral which is the only color the store had and after seeing the darker color am happy with it. i love the belt since most sweaters don't have anything to close them and the belt lays perfectly as well.
11486	"I chose to ignore the other reviews saying this shirt was too wide thinking that my wider shoulders would fill it out, but that's not the case. the shirt is adorable and soft and cute on, but just too wide around the armpit/chest area and with the horizontal stripes it just didn't look attractive. i would love to try the next size down to see if it works, but the black and white xxs is sold out so back it went. i am only 5'4"" with a shorter torso so the length was fine for me."
11487	"I am always on the hunt for jeans and regularly buy paige - these jeans are different than the regular paige styles, in all the best ways. they are made with super soft denim that is comfortable and very flattering; the waist is high, so my tush doesn't hang out when i sit - i love them. i am 5'8"" and 140lbs and these are long. i can only wear them with heels, but i was looking for a dress up jean and these are it!"
11488	
11489	This is just okay for me. the top is soft and surprisingly flattering, especially from the side, but the front rides up and the neckline never lays flat. it washes well and the tan/white combo is cute, but a little transparent.
11490	"The quality of this top is wonderful. thick enough to prevent see-through, but thin enough to create a beautiful drape. the fringe details are lovely. the top is slightly roomy (ranks between ""true to size"" and ""runs large,"" i.e., leaves room in the back when i clasp my hands together and stretch them out in front of me), but not really enough to size up. i'm 5'-4"", 120 lbs., athletic build, and the small fits well. my only issue with the aesthetic is that the pattern of the lace on the upper pa"
11491	"This is definitely a cute top! i am 5'1"" 34a, and bought the extra small. it fits well, very flowy. a little shorter than i like, but it still looks cute. it's thin, but soft and comfortable. i wore it just like the model, with my long jeans and some wedge sandals and it looks great for a spring day!"
11492	Love this dress! really nice quality, timeless design, not to mention the flared sleeves are so flattering! this dress makes me feel so cute and tiny. i normally struggle to function in off the shoulder tops but deal with it because i love the way that they look, but this one really is the perfect fit and has just the right amount of give without being too loose. the body size and length does run large, so size down on this one. now i understand why the petites were all sold out? whatever, modes
11493	I got this shirt because of the flutter sleeves, and i'm not disappointed. it is a classic t, with that little bit of an edge due to the sleeves. it is not fitted, which is what i was looking for. it also covers my bum, which i don't always like hanging out there. in all, it's perfect for my needs. i got the turquoise one and i may get the white one too!
11494	"Dress is so comfortable. great for town or resort. 5'7"" size 6 34a and i got a size small."
11495	"Gorgeous sleeves, flattering neckline...and a voluminous torso. i loved the fit of the top portion so much, i decided to buy it, knowing it would require alteration. the seamstress removed a *significant* amount of bulk and added vintage buttons to clasp the inverted pleat. i find many of these ""easy breezy"" tops create a shapeless look. extra volume in both the front and back creates a needlessly rotund profile. despite excellent posture, i looked both hunched and pregnant in the unaltered silh"
11496	Easy to wear with black or grey. i will wear as a work jacket, not necessarily just an outwear piece
11497	I am a fan of flutter sleeves, always have been. however, at 42 years old i sometimes feel as if i can't carry them off. not the case with this shirt. bordeaux has found a way to balance just sleeve with femininity and maturity. i'm a size 12 in jeans and tops. i ordered s large and it fit beautifully. very flattering.
11498	Loved the sweater and the sale price was great, but i could not take the shedding! even after just trying it on the first time, my jeans and top had shedding all over them. this was 2 minutes, i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day. had to return.
11499	Exactly as pictured. great and lightweight for summer but long enough with the cowl neck to layer for colder seasons. so comfy and easy.
11500	Love love love this sweater! lots of compliments as well :))
11501	This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much
11502	I tried this on in the store in a medium by accident, thinking that it was a large. i loved it even though the front was way too short on me and the elastic waist was way too tight. the store didn't have the next size up and after reading the other reviews i decided to order my standard xl online. its a keeper! i am plus sized and have an ample mid section and this was still flattering on me. i plan to wear it with a black duster sweater, leggings, and boots all winter long and then when the wea
11503	This shirt seemed to run really small, especially in the chest. i'm debating exchanging for a new size bc this was really cute but i'm not sure if i need to go up 1 or 2 sizes it was so tight
11504	I ordered this to arrive at my store and was so excited to try it on. it was soft and cuddly, but a little baggy under the arms, and it shed everywhere. underwhelmed.
11505	I just got this sweater and it really is a great fall weight. i disagree with other reviewers that it is oversized and that the sleeves are long. i found the sleeves to be just right and it to fit normally. i almost wish i got a medium just so it would be a little baggier and the sleeves would be a little longer. i got the green and am really happy with the color.
11506	Pretty blush color that is still neutral enough to wear with just about any outfit. runs true to size imo. can't wait to wear it this fall/winter.
11507	I recently came across this dress in store and decided to try it on. i immediately fell in love. my husband was patiently waiting outside the dressing area to see it and give his opinion but i knew i was going to get it regardless of his thoughts. :) this dress could be worn with heel, flats, sandals, booties, etc. the one drawback i have is the high cut of the wrapover in front. as other reviewers have said, i plan on wearing this places where i won't be sitting for long periods of time because
11508	I see that many of you, like myself, fell in love with the look and feel of this sweater, and reluctantly bought it even though it sheds like crazy! i just wanted to let you all in on a little trick to stop the shedding (it will sound strange, but it worked like a charm!) fold up the sweater, seal it in a ziploc bag, and pop it in the freezer for 24 hours. bam! it will shed no more! now i can completely love this sweater. :)
11509	I bought this sweater in the green and loved it so much i ended up ordering the pink also. it looks great with jeans or with a pencil skirt. the silhouette is flattering and the sleeves, though big, don't get in the way while i'm working. i'm a little worried about the looseness of the knit and the amount of lint it shed at first, so i don't know how long it will look and feel new. also, one of the buttons on the pink one was hanging by a thread when i first pulled it out of the package. at this
11510	I really love how comfortable and versatile this dress is. the midi length is perfect for booties or flats, and the cowl neck is loose and fluid, so it lays well. the only complaint i had, and it's minor, is the tulip skirt doesn't stay closed well when i walk or sit, which reveals more inner thigh than i am comfortable showing. i have to be very mindful of the skirt all day (i teach high school).
11511	I found this at my local store on sale and immediately snatched it up. i did not think of the wrap flying open until i got home and tried it on again. luckily, i was able to sew it up enough without compromising the drape and movement of the dress and without causing anyou pulling or puckering which isn't always easy when working with jersey.  that said, i really like the dress otherwise. it's super soft and i think i'll get a lot of wear out of it when i want something cute and comfy to put on.
11512	I bought this dress for a cruise i'm going on in january. it's so light and comfortable. i'm 5'10 and the length is perfect. it will look really cute with a jean jacket and some booties. great price for this dress! you can't pass this up!!
11513	"I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice, they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead, which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall, but at 5' 6"" these are a miss for me!"
11514	I love this incredibly soft fabric , it's well designed and very flattering . i am 6' tall with a large bustline , dresses can be difficult as the waistline usually hits in the wrong spot . but not this dress ! it's hits the spot and the high-lo hemline flatters my legs ! bought this to wear to hawaii ,paired with a panama hat and a pair of flatform sandels .
11515	I have not worn yet but excited to try it out soon with jeans and boots. comfy but has a nice sweater look...not too casual. sleeves are very long but don't think i want to downsize.
11516	Beautiful top but the angles emphasized my widest fluffy bits in an unattractive way. i ordered size large. the material, fabric and lace are pretty and well done. my arms looked huge too. and the piece under the arm hit below my bra and it was clearly visible by a couple inches. i carry my weight in my mid section and am short waisted. think this would look best on taller, thinner bods.
11517	Great structure
11518	I was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog, but disappointed when it got to stores. the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store. i'd say it even looks a bit purple. the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really don't like the color. i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning.
11519	.... it sheds on my cloths something fierce! not much i can do as i don't want to return it because i love it so. i love the longer panel in the back and the side slits. nice weight and feel, i just wish it didn't shed so much!
11520	Soft, versatile comfort. what more could you want in a legging?
11521	I bought this for an upcoming late-september seaside trip because it looked like it would be warm enough for cooler nights, but not too warm because of the open weave. i just received it yesterday, and i adore it. i got the pink color and was really torn between the green and the pink. i was hoping the pink would look more beige from far away (per one of the other reviews) and i was happy that it does. up close you can really see the pink, but from an arm's length away or more, it looks beige wi
11522	"This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however, is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3"" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the"
11523	Well fitted kinda slouchy sweater. matches photo and product description. looking forward to cooler temps!
11524	I tried this on in-store because i needed a cozy cardigan, but i did not buy it because i felt the quality was poor. it shed all over everything i tried on with it, and i left the store with little balls of sweater flufff all over my pants. disappointed.
11525	Purchased this item on sale-received it and it had two huge holes on the side.not possible to repair. very disappointed in lack of quality control. :(
11526	I am in love with this sweater. i am 5'4 and wear a size 8 and bought a large. perfect length and fit. will wear with jeans or leggings. the quality was amazing and i can't wait to wear it!
11527	I can't wait for it to get colder so i can wear this out. love the ochre color paired with the maroon faux fur lapel. i especially love the detail at the pocket edges. very well made. the faux fur is luxuriously soft and removable. this will go great with denim and long skirts. the wool is a bit stiff in my opinion but that's okay. this will make a great addition to your autumn and winter closet. most of my outerwear are blacks or dark blues or dark greys so it's nice to be able to wear a bit of
11528	"I had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be. it was tts (i'm 5""3 and usually wear a small). but the material was horribly scratchy. both the body of the top as well as the sleeves. and the design isn't all that flattering. it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life!"
11529	This shirt makes me feel stylish without trying! i can put this on and feel like a fashion blogger without trying! it is comfortable and fits true to size. it is flattering at the bottom without too much width/peplum.
11530	Love the color, weight and styling on this sweater. it is soft and comfortable and i will wear it a lot. the only downfall is that it sheds, so it can not be worn with leggings or you will end up with fuzz everywhere.
11531	"This is just the perfect sweater in my opinion. i got it in the rose, which is a gorgeous subtle color that will go with just about anything. i love the knit pattern and the buttons, and the sleeves are nice and long, which is crucial for me at my height (5'11""). overall i just see myself throwing this on over everything, so i'm sure i will treasure this for years to come!"
11532	Just lovely!  gift for my daughter who has two other vegan leather jackets from retailer!
11533	I love the fabric of this shirt and particularly the blousy back. it is slightly boxy on me and i wish it was just a little longer. looks really cute under cardigans.
11534	Absolutely love this top. it can be worn with jeans or a nice pair of pants. material is so soft.. love the length , little longer in the back. definitely would buy in another color
11535	I love this sweater! it's vivid, soft and high quality. it's a little shorter than i'd normally go for, but it will look great with a mid to high rise jean. it runs true to size and meant to be roomy. the red is very vibrant.
11536	"This top looked really cute. when i received it the fit was not flattering. it is snug on top and very loose on the bottom with an excess amount of material. it made me look very disproportionate. i returned it."
11537	This is an adorable top. sweet back detail, thin material but soft. the top is two sizes too big, i'm normally a large and a small fits. i know it is supposed to be baggy but the large was inches too big under each arm. size down and petite ladies will be sized out. love this though.
11538	This top is just lovely. the bow on the back is so unusual. i am so glad i bought it!!! i washed it on gentle and it turned out great!!!
11539	Just a cute, casual tee that i grabbed on sale, but i love the bow in the back! something unique for an otherwise plain tee!
11540	Soft cotton front, slightly more coarse back. shoulders run slimmer than bottom which flares out. bought on sale as a cute pajama top which will definitely work well. could also imagine with skinny jeans. normally wear a s, ordered an xs.
11541	I decided to order this skirt to look at it and regret it now as i want to keep it. one bummer is the smallest size (xs) runs big, the skirt falls on my lower waist aka hips on me, not on my waist. bu i love the look, it has pockets where the pattern reverts the fabric is soft and thick, making the skirt structured. the length was nice on me, though ti is a mini and there is no petite size, the hem still was above my knee, and therefore was acceptably flattering. the colors are also nice for fal
11542	This skirt is super cute and versatile. dressed up but still pretty casual with a sweater, tights, and boots. i'd say true to size or maybe runs a little on the large side; definitely doesn't run small. love it!
11543	I ordered an xl because most retailer button ups i need a 12 and sometime 14 due to my shoulders and chest but this was huge.
11544	Great quality, i didn't expect the neck to be so wide but it still looks nice.
11545	"I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful. i opened it, tried it on, sent it back...it is well made but has too many negatives. first, it is very thick. i ordered size 6 (5'2"", 140 lbs.). the size was good, but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen. it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way. finally, and most importantly, it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c"
11546	I like this so much that i ordered it in both colors. it is soft can be worn both ways, and i like the crisscross detail. very comfortable, not formfitting.   i usually order a medium or a large and in this one sized down to a small.
11547	This has instantaneously become my favorite sweater in my closet. the fit is great- a little oversized which makes it very cozy. i purchased my usual size xs. the shade of red is perfection. i wished it was a tad bit softer but would buy again and again!
11548	"The only problem with this top is that it only comes in two colors.  this is a lightweight easy to wear top that surprises you with the cute design details.  it will be easy to wear in the heat of my hometown.  i don't think it is too thin and i won't need to add a camisole.  i am 5'2"" and weigh 120 and i got a small.  perfect."
11549	I love this tee s much i bought 3 different colors! the back is beautiful. it is so comfy and soft but its added spice makes it perfect for those times you want a little more style.
11550	"This t-shirt is perfect for summer. light, breezy & easy. i'm 5'4.5"", 34dd, 150 lbs- m fits well. the front and the arms fit like a t-shirt, which means it looks busty for me. but that's how t-shirts always are for me. the back has something extra and that's the reason i'm keeping it."
11551	Love this jacket! really wish it came in real leather as well but can't beat this price point. great cut, fit. and love that the zipper is black. looks like it is worn in leather, most peoppe can't tell that it's vegan!
11552	The sides scooped up a bit too much on me. i was hoping to be able to tuck this into a skirt and wear to work, but there were definitely some gaps that showed the side of my midriff. back it goes. :(
11553	I absolutely adore this top!!! i got it in the blue and went back a few days later and got the gray as well. it's super soft and casual but still really cute. it's a little long (i'm 5'4) but i tuck in the front or tie a knot on the side and it looks good. i wish they had more colors so i could have a few more of these!
11554	This is an average top. i thought it would be a good work shirt (my office is very causal), but it was just too loungey looking. fit is true to size. the fabric is thin- a little see through. not worth $108 in my opinion. i returned it.
11555	"Maybe it's because i'm 40, but this top was underwhelming. i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big, obnoxious bow on the back. it does look cute on the model, so maybe it's a ""younger"" top. i would have felt silly wearing it."
11556	Very flattering cut.  very loose & flowy.  runs a little big for a small but fits well for someone who sometimes fits medium depending on the cut.  i need to wear a bralette with this top.
11557	Love the coral color of this shirt. only wish it was a little longer in the front. falls right to my jeans waistline.
11558	I have these tops in white and blue. very comfotable to wear. the back part swings with movements and is flattering. good price so i got one for my daughter!
11559	Lovely, warm sweater. excellent quality, fits as shown on model
11560	I saw this in the kelly green color one size larger than my normal. it didn't look much but i was so drawn to the very pretty green color so i tried it on anyway. boy, am i really glad i did! this is more than just your basic everyday tee. the back has a very cute gingham pleating detail that hangs well when paired with a skinny jean or leggings. material was pretty substantial for a tee and definitely not see-through. i am a true m on most retailer tops and this one is pretty true to size. the on
11561	I love this jacket. it is a perfect moto style jacket without being overly aggressive looking because it doesn't have the silver hardware. instead all the hardware is black which gives it a cleaner minimalist look. it is not super heavy. it also has a cute blue and white striped lining, which if you turn up the sleeves adds a surprise. i bought it in a size small so that it was comfortable and i would be able to put a light sweater under it if i wanted to. i generally take an xs or sometimes a s
11562	"This top is simple but super cute and comfortable. the bow in the back adds a feminine touch and it fits well (no gaping arm holes and not too tight or too loose). the white color is slightly see-through but not enough to wear a cami with my neutral racer-back bra. the xs fit me perfectly. for reference, i'm 5'6"", small busted and 125 lbs."
11563	Very cute top. i ordered the white & it is thin so you might want to wear a cami with it. will look very cute with jeans, shorts or skirts. love the back! wish it came in more colors - would definitely order it in black.
11564	This top is perfect! i love the fit and the length and the weight of the fabric! it is thin without being sheer. i just wish there were other fun colors...
11565	This is the perfect little shirt when you want more than an ordinary t-shirt. the pattern on the back panel adds a nice little extra touch. the blue tone is very rich looking, and could be dressed up or down.
11566	I usually pick the large size when it comes to fitted jackets but in this case i decided to go with size medium.  i have a broad back and round shoulders and large upper arms.  when i put the size large on, the body of the jacket looked too boxy on me.  the medium is much more flattering but i cannot put a thick layer on underneath.  when the weather gets cooler, i am pairing this with my herbalist dress and my other sleeveless garments.  i am 135# 36d 38/28/35.
11567	This top is adorable. i love it! i couldn't figure out which way to wear it so i just wear it both ways.the tag is on the side, which allows you to wear it either way. it does run big! i normally wear a medium and i could have used a small, but kept the medium because i like very loose clothing.
11568	This is a great casual shirt that works great for a day at the beach and is also comfortable enough to wear to sleep. wore this shirt to school one day with an undershirt underneath and wore it again hiking several days later with just a sports bra underneath.
11569	Not flattering and not the color it appears online. this is really a pink shirt.
11570	I love swing dresses but they never seem to work out for me. however, lately i have been trying on swing tops like this one and they are super scores! i love this top! in my store, they had a rack of test materials where they don't have the full line but they have a look at some online features or clothes that are very new releases. this was on the rack. i knew it wasn't my size but i tried it on anyway and i am absolutely in love. i am waiting for a sale (as always) but i am going to get this i
11571	"This is a very cute and unique cropped jacket. the attention to detail is excellent. i am normally a small but had to size down to an xs as the style is a bit boxy and to make it more fitted/tailored, an xs looked better. i am 5'5"" 118 lbs, 34c, slim athletic build. it is a chic alternative to a cardigan on a cooler day."
11572	Very feminine, fun and if you like this style i highly recommend. i am a 6/8 and both fit the same so i went with the 6- 36c bust 29 waist-short torso. fabric nice and light and i need no cami! very attractive blouse and very retailer.
11573	I am not usually one for super girly tops, but i could not resist this top. the material is beautiful and this top can definitely be dressed up or dressed down, i think it is extremely versatile. it is a little bit see-through but if you just wear a nude bra it's perfect! i usually wear a 00 or 0 but i got a 2 in this top because it is a little tight in the sleeves/across the shoulders. but if you size up you should be perfect! super cute and i definitely recommend you get before it sells out!
11574	I love this shirt! it's such a beautiful striking color, yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight. the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute. i bought another one of these when it went on sale. so now i have two just in case;) haha
11575	Love this top b/c it's very feminine! got this at 20% off and it's very flattering!
11576	"This is a cute and quirky feminine top with the ruffle detailing and polka dot flannel inside the sleeve cuffs. i wish it was little longer and maybe not flannel, then it would be perfect, but overall i liked it. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame (plus a relatively short torso) and the small fit throughout the shoulders and chest."
11577	The design and quality are fantastic! i had to order a little larger because of my bust and shoulders - it's still flattering though. can be dressed up or casual. i wish it came in more colors!
11578	I was a bit apprehensive about buying the top, after reading the reviews.  surprisingly, i love the shirt!  it's very feminine; soft; light for the hot months; and, figure flattering.
11579	"Just got this top and i love it! it's color is more saturated in person, which i like. more of a pinky-purple. very sweet and feminine. i still have a bit of a ""mommy tummy"" and the style hides that pretty well. it's very soft and comfortable as well. overall, happy with this top :)"
11580	So i recommend wearing with something more fitted, or with a flare (jeans), or tucked in like the picture. i love the detail of hte polka dot on the sleeves and collar (inside), so if you leave the collar open or roll the sleeves up a bit, you see hte contrast. it is a bit short, and i am petite, i ended up with regular size anyway otherwise, it may have been too short.  colors are nice, and i love the material, it is very soft and hoepfulyl warm (my orffice is freezing). should ahve grabbed it
11581	I am not sure why the first reviewed hated this dress so much. i personally like that it looks a tad retro. length is shorter, but not mini or too short. i ordered the xxs p and it looked ok on me (and i am older). the colors are fun and appropriate for fall, or winter, the sparkle (golden thread) can bring this dress into the holiday season (and beyond). i love the turtleneck part, only thing is it is really high, and the embroidery gets a little lost in it (top of the design) feel is thick, no
11582	"Love the pattern, i thought i would be hosed and need a petite, but the regular xs fits nicely. it is on the thiner side, so great for summer (office is cooold) love subtle squares, glad they still had my size at sale! :-)"
11583	Great very flattering bohemian dress! and it's silk!
11584	It's a cute top, but the only complaint i have is that it is difficult for me take off. it goes on easily, but i get always have a bit of a struggle trying to take it off. my shoulders tend to get stuck so i can't pull my arms out easily. i just wish the top had an extra button or two on the back or was made with material that allowed for some stretch without fear of destroying the lacework. i didn't want to size up another size because i have a petite body shape that would've been overwhelmed b
11585	I really love this top. it looks so sweet and beautiful and is perfect for dressing up a pair of jeans. if you are on the short size it may be a little long so keep that in mind. i love it!
11586	I ordered this top based on the photos. this looked unique and beautiful, plus i've loved past designs by this brand. i thought this would be nice for summer. there isn't a straight-on view of the front of the top for a reason. the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest, away from the border of the rest of the flowers. the flower looks kind of like a bee. i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem.
11587	I ordered the xl and the colors are just as pictured. the material is so soft. the problems: too short and too small. i'm a little over 5 ft. 5 inches and this top ran so short on me. i wish there were three more inches of material and then it would have been great. it was cut a little tight along the shoulder line too. i was so disappointed that this couldn't work on me. i like a romantic style, especially for comfortable basics. but, this was a pass for me. i had to return it. the ruffles on t
11588	I have the pineapple dress from last year. when i saw this top with the lemons, i was in love. i don't usually pay this much for a top, but i had a special event coming up. i searched and searched, but nothing compared to the lemon top, so, with my birthday discount, i bit the bullet and ordered it. my first thought was that it didn't seem very substantial for the price. i decided to keep it though, because it is such a unique piece. i wore a beige cami underneath along with a beige skirt and it
11589	Beautiful sweater, very delicate fabric, unique design, but it runs very small. i usually wear a m, but ordered a large based on the previous review hoping that would do the trick. the sizing, along with being long waisted isn't a good combination. unfortunately, i'm returning the sweater.
11590	This is a beautiful shirt, however the cut and drape were off. i'm only 104 pounds, but this top made me look pregnant. the fabric jutted out at the front. it's a shame, because it really is lovely. i sent it back.
11591	This is a very stylish cardigan but it runs small. i usually take a small but i took a medium in this. for reference i am 130 lbs, chest 36c. i fell so in love with it once i put it on but you have to watch for snags as it is extremely delicate. got the 20% off today and couldn't be happier with this purchase.
11592	I so wanted to love this dress, but the bell sleeves were enormous! if you're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool, but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings. the rest of the dress was beautiful, though, and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. i would recommend sizing down, as the dress runs large.
11593	"I saw someone else wearing this sweater and had to find it! i'm 5'5""and 118 lbs and ordered the small. the back of the sweater hits a few inches above my back pockets. i've been wearing it with a tank underneath and it's been the perfect sweater for fall weather. i was worried the poncho effect might make it hard to wear this sweater with a jacket but it's actually less bulky than other ""real"" sweaters i have."
11594	This dress is beautiful. however, it should be noted that there is a gold threading detail throughout the dress, which is not pictured. the dress appears to be a solid cream print in the pics but in person it has gold and cream. i sized up bc i didn't want it to be too fitted, i'm between a 6 snd 8 so i went w medium. it fits will but slightly big. i'd say tts though.
11595	Beautiful sweater - cool enough to wear on a florida evening and it will be perfect for vacation. the sleeves hit right above the wrist bone (exactly as shown on the model) and i really like that. sheer fabric but still a sweater - you will need a cami or tank underneath. can't wait to wear it!
11596	"I just received this sweater in the mail and when i first opened the packaging i questioned as to whether or not they sent to correct color. be aware that this ""brown"" is actually gray. i checked the site to see if it was even offered in gray, which it is not. additionally, the sweater is quite a bit shorter than the picture on the model implies. i still love it, the comfy coziness of it will be great for fall in new england. looking forward to wearing it."
11597	I have always bought interesting, pretty, wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer. now the dresses are just retro funky. sad to see.
11598	"The pictures do not do this blouse justice. the pleat in the front is so flattering that i did a double take (this detail doesn't come through the images, which is a shame as it is the most beautiful element of this blouse). the collar that stands up just enough is something unexpected, and the sleeve length is fun yet sophisticated. i am madly in love with this blouse and highly recommend it to anyone.   it is extremely see-through...so unless you want to show off your nips, you should expect"
11599	I kept this top, only because i needed a plain black tank, but there is nothing special about it. i found it a bit large and thin cheap material.
11600	This is really a lovely top, but the color online is not quite what the color actually is in person. this was a find in my store today and it is a little more lilac than the picture shows. the cut is extremely flattering and the fabric is very soft as is the case with most one september items. the one recommendation that i have for this is that because the main fabric is a soft knit, the proper undergarments are really needed. i tried it with a lace bra and you could see a lot the details of the
11601	I really wanted to love this top the material and pattern are lovely but the fit is strange. it looks like a maternity top on me and as another reviewer said it is right across the back but loose at arms and midsection. for the price i returned it.
11602	"Beautiful pink top.  comfortable, love the color and print , style and sleeves.  good quality.  didn't have the issues with the placement of the bees over my breasts that other reviewers did. the bees were at the sides of my breasts. covered my butt for the most part in jeans. flattering cut.  i got an xs (5'2"", 34b, 115#)."
11603	"I read the previous reviews, but decided to try it out since retailer was having 40% off sale items. it looks very flattering on me, and great fit for my body type. i would recommend."
11604	Beautiful material, great design. get a bigger size.
11605	Runs huge! returning the m for a s; normally a m top and s bottom in sizing. very soft, wonderful colour.
11606	"This was my favorite shirt before i ordered it .... i absolutely couldn't wait to wear it.  but i was so disappointed.  at 5'2"" and 120 i have a athletic frame ... the small was tight in the shoulders but had so much extra fabric that i felt lost.  i wasn't wearing the shirt .... it was wearing me."
11607	Love the color of this dress, however found it a little boxy, and the arms are too tight. i ordered up a size ( m) which is probably why it is boxy and i can hardly get it over my arm, i am very athletic. probably should have sent it back.
11608	I love this top! was not immediately in love with it when i saw it on line but when i saw it in store the other day and got to try it on i fell in love!! the colors at a little deeper in person, which i loved! it is a traditional soft flannel top! it is fitted and flattering! a must have for fall/winter!!
11609	"The photos don't look it, but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3"" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall.   disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!"
11610	This shirt runs true to size. i'm an xl and it fit perfectly! that is my first reason for loving it. it is super soft and so comfortable i don't want to take it off! the trim inside the cuffs and button line is navy with large white polka dots, which i love. the ruffle of the shoulders i'm not super wild on but it does give it a touch of different. the color of the photo is very accurate. i love the muted pink in the plaid.
11611	I love this more than my pineapple top. i am 128lbs and wear between a size 2-4 in tops got this in size 4 (same as the pineapple) and fits perfectly and comfotably. the color is white and has a lovely lace pattern. i would say it runs a litle on the small side. material is a bit more stiff than my pineapple top but i love the way it feels. in my opinion this is a staple top you can dress it up for a wedding or just going out its super lovely. they were so popular at the retailer near me tw
11612	Purchased as a gift, but needed to return due to recipient weight challenged in past 6 months. heavier material of neutral tone ( with detailing of epaulets) pairs well with dresses, skirts, jeans, jeggings and whatever style of boots. veratile garment and will re-purchase for self in future.
11613	I spend a lot of time on the retailer website. it never occurred to me to try this dress. a salesperson suggested it in the store and i tried it on. it is really cute on. i bought a thrift store denim jacket to throw over it. the only con is the sleeves. i am 5'3' and my arms are not very long. the bell sleeves are a little crazy on me, but they will be hidden under the jacket.
11614	What a pity! this blouse has a beautiful design, however it doesn't fit well on the body. it's not really a size problem, it's just not a well fitted blouse. the color is very deceptive, it looks white on the picture, but it's actually pink. i'm probably going to return it.
11615	Saw this in the greenville, sc store, and it caught my eye. i ordered a petite a week later, and i adore it. nice embroidery. a little sparkle. the sleeves are voluminous, but it makes me feel sassy.
11616	Picked this up on sale - was on the fence about the bright reddish/orange coloration, but it really says summer and goes so easily with multiple summer pieces. it is generously cut and made very well. i've worn it on cooler/rainy days and it really brightens everything up. best part is that it launders well too.
11617	This top hangs very nicely on me. i got the blue and have received compliments every single time i have worn it. it may help that i'm tallish with long legs. i usually wear it with black leggings and ankle boots. love, love, love it!
11618	Soft and unique. love the sleeves. my usual size medium fits perfectly. per the other reviewer, i guess my bust is large enough for the flowers to be on the side and not directly on breasts! my only wish is that it has some embroidery on it....love!!
11619	This top has a bit of a retro flare but so adorable on. looks really cute with a pair of faded boot cut jeans.
11620	"Love this dress. from the great fabric (soft yet substantial) that's similar to sweater material, to the amazing detail of the flower design (it's really so unique and i mean that in a good way!), to the color (a tan with gold flecking), and lastly to the really flattering fit, not to mention those retro bell sleeves!  all around a fun dress! it was true to size and not too short, hitting my 5'4"" height about 2"" above my knees."
11621	This top is a mix of materials - a silk and more of a t shirt material. i purchased for dressier wear but the material makes it more casual. i like the sale price so i'm keeping!  size down, runs a tad loose.
11622	I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl fit as expected in this blouse. however, the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering. the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume. i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse. the blouse is a good quality, but there were too many other issues for me to keep it.
11623	This jacket has cute details. i like the front pockets and color. it has no shape and is about 1 size bigger than marked. i felt like a sack of potatoes in it.
11624	"I really wanted to love this. sadly, the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly, it's see through! a top like this looses it's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally, good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the ""poor man's pineapple top."" i couldn't agree more, sigh. i really did want"
11625	I thought this blouse ran a bit large-swinging wide at the hips. it does bunch in the bust area if you are larger. a correct undergarment fixed this problem. i am a 36ddd and thought the size 4 was perfect.
11626	This jacket was a little shorter than i had expected, but i still really enjoy the cut and fit of it.
11627	Despite being batwing and sort of poncho-like, this sweater is quite flattering on. hangs just right. unique cut and soft fabric.
11628	I tried this on in the store. i'm usually a 6 in tops but it was tight across the chest. i sized up to an 8 and it was still tight. i would have considered the 10 but with the 8 there was too much fabric on the bottom. overall design and material were good but the sizing was off.
11629	I got m in black with white. it's ok. material is soft and nice. classy. plan to return it since color is not flattering, makes me look old.
11630	I bought this dress during the retailer weekend and i'm so happy i did!  this is a very well-made, well-designed dress that is quite figure flattering.  the marriage of artsy and colorful on a neutral background makes sense and the combination of colors and the style of the dress work well together.  the wearer will definitely have several options for footwear pairings.  this dress is as fun and playful as it is classy.  i can't wait for an occasion to wear this dress!
11631	Ordered this in my normal size large in taupe. the jacket fit tts. the length was cropped but just long enough (hit just below my belly button) to feel comfortable and not too short for my 5'9 height. the quality feels good.
11632	O.k. i soo wanted to love this dress. if you are slim and small chested it is true to size and lovely. i am slim and tall 5'9 but am large chested. a 36d i usually wear an 8/10 so bought a 10. it was too tight around my chest and back. so i went up a size to a 12. it was better but not exactly comfortable. i could get away with it but for the price had to send it back. the idea of going up another size yet again was a thought but i worried it wouldn't solve my issue.
11633	Got this in the blue/floral and absolutely love it!!
11634	Ugh, i was so disappointed with this shirt. i was so excited when i saw it online and thought it would be a perfect summer shirt with the light colors and the flower print. unfortunately it falls flat and i understand now why they don't have a straight on photo of the shirt, its very plain and lays very unflatteringly. it's definitely missing something in the front. i typically wear a small to an extra small and i ordered this in an extra small and would have needed an xxs if i hadn't returned i
11635	"I've wondered abt this swtr but hesitated to order being it has dolman sleeves. decided to wait for it to come in at the local store. yesterday i spotted it in the store & tried on the orange, labeled 'red' online. i was really looking for the 'cream' but the store did not have it. well, the orange is really much prettier in person. fit is perfect in my usual size s. overall body fit & length is generous, sleeves are wrist length & i'm only 5'3"". most likely the sleeves will be shorter on taller"
11636	Lol on the previous comment about it being a poor man?s pineapple blouse. i think the pineapple blouse prints are too large on a petite person like me (i?m 5?2?), thus i prefer this blouse. i concur with the previous reviewer about getting makeup on the blouse due to the narrow collar. if you wear makeup like i do, you must find a trick to taking it on and off. for me, i put it on prior to putting on makeup (i even put tissue paper around the collar while putting on makeup, and don?t even think
11637	It doesn't work with me only because i have very skinny arm. i can not handle the arm part of the dress. it is still very pretty though. i would keep it if i fit the arm :(
11638	
11639	This t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything. my only concern is the fabric is super light. not enough to be see through, but just enough to make me question the quality. i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though. the drape is nice and not super revealing; discreet enough for work. i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile.
11640	
11641	I was on the fence about this top, because i don't typically do longer tunic styles. however, it really is quite lovely. i paired it with long jeans, wedge sandals, and a delicate necklace - so pretty! it fits very nicely and i was surprised at how much i liked the length.
11642	The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.
11643	This top is beautiful and i really wanted to be able to keep it - i've tried it on 3 times. it is not for big-chested girls (34ddd) - it hangs like i'm 20 months pregnant because the top area lands on top of my chest. sadly this will be going back. it is beautiful and flowing and a perfect weight.
11644	Love the feminine take on flannel and how it fits like a tailored shirt. i am a bit long waisted and the side slit reveals a little too much when i lift my arms. if the shirt was just a little longer it would be perfect.
11645	"I've been coveting the first edition of this top (pineapples) and was thrilled to find this same style with lemons. i called my local store and put a few sizes on hold so i could ensure the perfect fit. good job i did! the top is beautiful but it's super tight across the back - fine if you want to stand still & look pretty. if, however, you want to go about your usual activities, like eat for example, i'd suggest you size up. for reference i'm usually a 2-4 in retailer tops (34b, 5' 5"" and 130lbs)"
11646	"I purchased this is off white and it is a stunner! feminine? check! stylish? check! hem hits at a flattering part of the body? check! great with jeans or tailored pants? check! i cannot say anything bad about this blouse-well, maybe the button back is a little convenient but it sure looks pretty! i am 5' 21/2"" and 110 pounds and usually wear a 0 or 2 but i purchased in a size 4 and it fits perfectly! can't wait to wear this with my olive green skinny jeans!"
11647	I ordered this in blue, and loved the color. i'm not typically into the flowing top style, but i tried a few items on my last order, this being one. it's unseamed at the bottom, which was my primary reason for returning it - i couldn't see that in the photo online - but if that is your style, this item is good quality, soft, comfortable material, and a great spring or fall blue.
11648	The fit and style of this dress are beautiful. it's a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable. i really wanted to love it, but the color just didn't work for me. the pictures make it look like it's a nice cream color, but it's very tan and i can't pull it off with my coloring.
11649	Love!! so comfy! i wish they came in more colors. i'd order every one!!
11650	"I've been searching for a pretty and unique ""party top"" and thought this was it. it is beautiful and unique but much too cropped for me and i'm only 5'3"". sadly i had to return. maybe would be more appropriate on someone younger"
11651	"I ordered these jsut coz they were on sale... i now wish my size was offered in more colors. (only mossy-sage was left, though nice neutral color, really0.  the fit is great, stretchy but stil lslightly structured. i ordered the 25p and that was perfect, length fine too (i am 5'1.5"", 115 lbs).  looked really nice with a pair of red heel i was trying on too!"
11652	I wear jeans so much, therefore i love to a variety in color. these jeans are so comfortable. they are like wearing sweat pants, but they truly keep their shape so well. i bought the red, which is a year around red, kind of a bright apple red. i will definitely be buying another pair of these ag jeans.
11653	"I really like this top.  for reference, i am usually an xs or s in retailer tops since many of them run large, however, in this top i ordered a size m and it fit nicely.  in any brand other than retailer, my usual size is m as i am 36d bust, 132 lbs., 5""5."
11654	
11655	This top is a little big but i sized down and liked it a lot. can be casual or can dress it up with a statement necklace. perfect fall shirt
11656	I love this dress! i have an hour glass figure and the dress is very flattering on me. i didn't encounter a problem with the colors or pattern as others have stated.
11657	This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot, it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.
11658	I like to wear swing tops because they are comfortable, not confining. this is definitely true for this top- i have an xs and it is quite spacious and boxy shaped. this is a simple cotton shirt but the ruffle adds a nice detail, and without being too much ruffle either. great to throw on with jeans!
11659	Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit, more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.
11660	Love this jacket!!! it is soooo soft and goes with everything. you will want to wear it every day. loved it so much i bought my mother one, too.
11661	Got this for my wife for christmas and she is very happy with it. the size is perfect for her and she regularly orders things as a medium from this store.
11662	Really liked the fan pattern and the cut was cute and flattering.  but the material is thin and all the edges are not finished and look frayed making the shirt look and feel cheap.  would have kept if thicker material and the edges were finished.  not worth full price
11663	I bought these in 'vintage sage' and i grab for them as often as my favorite skinny jeans. if you are just dipping your toe in colored pants i would reccomend the same color, it is undertsated and easily paired with so many other colors. the legs run a little big but the waist is tru to size, so for comfort i went with my usual size.
11664	"This fabric is the same as the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's lightweight and stretchy. the problem with this particular dress is the pattern in the fabric will be a little different on each dress depending on how the pattern was cut when it was made. i had to try on 5 different dresses to find one that was cut so the pattern looked and fell in the right spots when wearing the dress. hence 4 stars. the bodice is lined but the skirt itself is not. it is not see through. i'm 5'4"" and 120#."
11665	I have only worn this 3 times with no signs of pilling, yet. it is good for cool spring days/evenings. for me, it'll be the cooler 3-seasons sweater. i wear a size large and it fits properly. i have worn lightweight long sleeve knit tees under this with ease in the sleeves. i think a slim sleeved shirt/blouse would work equally well. while i like the idea of the pockets, i think they'll stretch out easily beyond a tissue or quick hand warming. i removed 1 star due to the high price and i receive
11666	I also agree with the other reviewers that it's important to try on a couple due to pattern differences. this dress has a beige base- the photo is a little misleading. i ended up returning it because the colors didn't do much for me, i think they look great on the model but that's because the beige doesn't blend into her at all. i also think it's a little overpriced for what the dress is- a great summer day dress.
11667	Love these jeans. fit great. i've had other colored denim from ag that stretched out too much, were too thin, but these are a nice thicker fabric. i ordered the red and the moss, and the red fit a little better than the moss in the same size. not sure if the dye process affects the fabric but the red pair seemed a bit more substantial. the moss is great too though, so i may keep both.
11668	I wish i could buy this is more colors! so easy to dress up or dress down
11669	I ordered my usual size small. i din't notice any fit problems after taking a quick look in the mirror the first day i wore them to my muscle training class. (this garment is more skin revealing than i really like, but i need to stay cool in the summer heat.) during the work-out i noticed that the leg edges of the shorts showed fat bulges; this was ugly, embarrassing, and unnecessary since i do not have overly fatty legs. later i noticed that the low-waist line of the shorts showed bulging fat a
11670	Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well, it really did not lay right on me. i'm a 34d, and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big, the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me.
11671	I was so excited to try these on at my local retailer. i'm so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off. the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward. they were also not as soft as i expected them to be.
11672	I love these pants. like, obsessively love, like didn't want to take them off to wash them, love. annnnd i wish i hadn't because they came out of a delicate cycle cold water wash with a huge part of the leg seam ripped apart like a spider web. maybe i just got a bad pair, but i wasn't prepared to have to patch them after one wash for the price.
11673	The colors on this aren't as vibrant as i hoped. love the cutouts on the arms though. great 4 season dress!
11674	Love this dress!!! must try on to see how cute is really is.
11675	Finally a top that fits true to size, is comfortable, and is the quality i expect when shopping at retailer. i cannot recommend this top more! if it came in other color motifs i would buy them too. perfect fall transition top.
11676	Gosh, this is a beauty! maeve can be a little iffy on sizing, but i find this to fit tts. beautiful details, fit is comfortable yet elegant, nice length...i have zero complaints on this. it is sheer enough to need something underneath, but the fabric is lightweight enough that the extra layer doesn't seem bothersome. nice quality piece (not overly delicate despite the lacy details and sheerish fabric).
11677	"Love this blouse--looks like a fp blouse yet a bit cheaper and well made! looks feminine and edgy on. may size out for taller gals b/c it is a bit on the shorter length. i am 5'5"" and the length is just right on me untucked. the lace on the sleeves are gorgeous and neckline is not too high!"
11678	I liked the top, it is cute, but i didn't keep it as i have similar tops like it and i had better options. however:  color: it is true that htere are differentials in the coloring of fabrics in this top, but that is not necessairly a bad thing, it kind of gives t personality.  lace part (this is where i have a similr one, tank all alce like that): darker ivory, drkest part of hte shirt. cut to neck is flatetering, and different from the low lunging things we see a lot of.  body: true to size, i
11679	It is a pretty dress but not what i had hoped for (i ordered it online.) i like slits on sleeves but the dress doesn't fit me well, so i plan to return it. p.s. it has pockets! :-)
11680	I usually wear either an xs or a small and i went with the small because i wanted it flowy and long because i am 5'9. it is a great fit, but it is a little sheer. i will probably have to wear a cami underneath.
11681	I got this shirt 2 weeks ago and have already worn it 4 times! i love it and every time i wear it i get compliments on it. it is so flattering with jeans or nice fitted black pants. if you are wavering about getting this shirt.... get it. i promise you will love it.
11682	Not sure where to start with this top...it's that good! i am usually a large in most maeve tops and that's sizing up for extra flow. i ended up grabbing this piece of perfection in an xl only because it ran a little shorter than i anticipated and was kind of tight through my shoulders. i wanted more flow (as always) so i went up in size. for that reason i feel it runs pretty true to size. this is the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and is definitely a must have! it has sold out with
11683	"Frustrated that retailer tops have been so short lately! i'm 5'7"" and it hits at the top of my pants. makes me look a bit boxy. so disappointing because i wanted it for family photos. otherwise the design is gorgeous. having a hard time returning it but for the price point, it probably has to go back :("
11684	If you have anything larger than an a cup, this shirt will likely not fit right. it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest. it literally runs right through the center of the breasts. what were they thinking? if it had been three inches higher or lower, it would have been perfect. for reference, i'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup.
11685	
11686	Looks great! it is more off white/tan then white though
11687	This is sure to become my favorite shirt! this shirt is feminine and the fit is perfect. the white lace is strategically placed, so you do not have to wear a cami on those hot summer days, but you can for the work day. i cannot wait to wear this!!
11688	"This top is so pretty! i love the lace details and the embroidery which really makes this top something special. it's true that it is on the shorter side but that seems to be an intentional aspect of the style. i didn't find it to be too short sitting well below my waist line (i'm 5'10""). i usually wear a medium in retailer clothes and this top is no exception it fit perfectly! i know this will be one piece i wear quite often!"
11689	I loved the idea of this dress, but i find that it isn't very flattering. i think the arm holes are actually very interesting, but i'm 5'5 and 135lbs, and the dress made me look fat and gave me no shape at all. maybe it would look better on a different body type.  the material is soft, but a bit stuffy and i could tell it would give me crazy static in my hair.
11690	I just loved this online and love it in person. so feminine and delicate. just perfect for summer get togethers.
11691	I wore this dress yesterday for the first time and got several compliments. its unique and super-pretty in person. it hides flaws well and the material is nice. i must have bigger arms than the model because you can barely tell from the picture what the arm slits look like. i don't mind the way they look, but..the way the piece of fabric there grazed on my arms all day kept making me feel like my bra strap had fallen down. speaking of bra straps, the neckline is wide and i felt like i kept havin
11692	"The fit on these is starkly different than the ""black hawk"" version also being sold online. i could barely get my leg in those! i typically wear a 27-29 - a 28-29 in this brand of jeans - and the 29 fit great. i have very large calves, so most ""kick out"" cop flares don't really provide the full effect for my body type, but these worked really well and i could definitely see the flare at the bottom. i am 5'8"" and these hit right above my ankle, just as pictured online.  ---------- what made me"
11693	These pants are great, as is the case with most c of h jeans.  they are a perfect length if you are 5&#39;5&quot; or shorter (i.e. you don&#39;t need to cuff them several times).  i love the relaxed but chic look.  they run large so definitely size down at least one size.  so happy they were on sale!
11694	
11695	"I bought this to celebrate my birthday! i get a new ""suit"" every year. it was a milestone birthday and this dress did not disappoint."
11696	"I wanted to comment about the wash. yes, these jeans look really ?dirty? when you pull them out of the package. but after a few months of washing, the dirty color has really mellowed. also, i am a usual 26 in jeans, purchased these in 25 and could have fit into  the 24. i may purchase another pair, these jeans are really unique, comfortable, great  for the summer with sandals or converse."
11697	I got this dress and think it's just great. it's a bit formal, but a bit whimsical at the same time. i really disagree with others said about the opening along the arms. i think they are barely noticeable but are nice surprise. this is a perfect california winter dress. i could see how a woman in colder parts of the country might not appreciate the slits on the arms but i think it's nice to show a little skin in a conservative way. i plan to wear it to a classical music concert soon. and i got i
11698	Fits perfect. i'm 5'3 and the size 2 regular fit perfect. not too long it too short, just perfect.
11699	I laughed to myself  as i pulled these jeans on in the dressing room, expecting them to look ridiculous. instead, i was amazed at how well they fit, how cool they looked, and how comfortable they were (two sizes smaller than my usual).  yes, this 66 yo woman rocked these jeans!  i love the intricate whiskering, raw leg opening, and worn, dirty wash.  usually i do not like the dirty look, but this is good dirty. try them on:  you may just fall for them.
11700	
11701	I loved this dress and i really loved it more after i bought it on sale. i am 5'3 100lbs and the only thing that bothers me is that the arm of it are somewhat tight when i reach out to get something. other wise the dress is great and get a lot of compliments on it. i paired it with black nylons and black plain leather booties and it looked great!
11702	I have been looking for flares that are not tight through the thigh and these are definitely them...but for me they were so long that to hem them would ruin the style of the pants. i'm 5'5 and have long legs but i would need a high heel to maintain the intended style, and that's not what i was looking for. otherwise, beautiful.
11703	Love these jeans! the material is soft and very flattering on the hips.
11704	Love the pattern of this tunic. it's comfy and unique.
11705	Bought this dress to wear to work. love it! great buy
11706	This is exactly as pictured, and fits as it does on the model in the last picture. my only hang-up is that it's a little pricey for a t-shirt, the fabric is standard t-shirt material, not stiff but also not super soft which i was hoping for. my hubby had no idea what the pattern was til i pointed it out :)
11707	"Nice dark indigo with minimal fading. medium denim thickness, with stretch. i bought size 25 and it is snug, but doesn't squeeze. my hip is 34.5"" and 28"" waist. love these. i will be getting them hemmed up to ankle length. i am 5' 5"" and find the little kick out at the ankle (from getting them shortened) to be very cute and classy. if you keep them full length to your shoe, they will have a slightly baggier bootcut look. these remind me of my point sur hightower straight leg jeans, with maybe an"
11708	I love this dress! it is a very casual and loose fit, which makes it super comfortable. i highly recommend it since it is versatile for fall and spring and can be styled quite a few ways.
11709	I purchased this tee in the blue and it is so very cute. its such a soft thin tee and a delight to wear on these hot summer days. i went with xs on this one and i still have plenty of room.. i have paired it with jean shorts, capris and it goes really well with the pilcro hypen chino shorts.
11710	I bought this tee for the cute print. otherwise, this tee is nothing special. i usually wear an xs, but bought an xxs, based on how loose the tee looks on the model. it's pretty thin and more like a slub cotton. i think i will hand wash it, just in case.
11711	"I wasn't sure about this dress when i ordered it online, but thought i would give it a try. i am 5'2"" (ordered an xs) and thought i may be too short to pull something like this off, and that it might look like a moo-moo or maternity dress on me. but, i absolutely love it! my husband does too...very sexy and low-key. i wore it for the first time today and received 5 compliments within an hour! this is going to be one of my favorites!"
11712	I love this top! it's very delicate and pretty. flattering cut. the fabric is sheer, so wear with a cami or a pretty bra.
11713	I ordered an xsp online, which is my usual size, and it fit perfectly. it's that unique and cute kinda piece you expect from retailer. if you're going to wear a t-shirt, might as well still have a little detail and style.
11714	Beautiful color and soft texture. this piece is flattering and can be worn in many seasons.
11715	"I agree with others that the shape is not perfect, it does billow a bit by the hips. but the xxs petite (someone returned) was good on me. length was perfect, sleeve were not too tights. (30dd, 26.5 in waist, 35 in hips, 115 lbs) colors are subdued, making the jacket more neutral. keeping in mind for later..."
11716	"This top definitely drew my attention when i walked into the store. i loved the back and the fabric is super soft/silky. i tried it one and the usual 0 - fit nicely, i don't have petite to compare, or 00, but i decided to stick with 0. it will look so nice with white shorts (or navy# or jeans or even my denim pencil skirt... why i decided to buy it #i really must avoid the store!)  115 lbs for reference..."
11717	I ordered the xl in the blue version and the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. the material is very thin. definitely need a tank/cami underneath. the pattern is adorable. the colors are much brighter in person. it's such a fun tee for summer. i just wish they hadn't sewn the sleeves in the various places. it's a little awkward. it shrank while washing & air-drying so it needed to be reshaped. if you get it and it's running a bit big, washing it will help with the fit. i like pa
11718	I was attracted to the colors when i first saw it...then i saw the back of it! the largest sz in the store was an 8.i had to order it, and got a sz 10. i then returned it for a 12 in order for it to drape properly in front. shorter than i usually wear, but worn with a higher waist bottom it fits nicely. and that back! not only is is striking, i am able to wear my regular bra under it, and the straps don't hang out.
11719	I wanted something for the hot summers here, and this fits the ticket. very lightweight and airy. it's somewhat of a strange design, short in the front, hitting an inch or two above the knee, but the back is unusually long. the lining is awkward, and kind of tight and difficult to get into. the material is very thin, and although i haven't noticed any strings or unraveling like other reviewers, it's not the highest quality. overall the dress is nice and lightweight, but not the greatest quality
11720	"I was so excited to order this beautiful coat.  it does seem well made and is very soft.  unfortunately, the fit is completely off and is overall large.  i ordered a small, as this coat appears slightly more snug on top, a-line on the bottom, with three buttons.  i am 5'6"" and weigh approximately 145.  i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming.  instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared.  the  pleat on the back is unflattering.  sadly going back."
11721	"The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1'', 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite.   first of all, when i button this, there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow, yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all, making the gaping even worse.  the ""skirt"" at the bottom is made of a very cheap, thin, slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled, and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl"
11722	"I tried this on in the store and it fit like a tent on me. it doesn't help that i'm 5'1"" and the store didn't have the petite sizes. maybe on a teller person it would work better. or maybe if i had been able to try the petite size it would have more wearable. it is a comfy style and the natural fiber is a plus. i have another holding horses dress that i love which also runs large. i did not mark this as ""runs large"" because the sleeves are more true to size while the bodice is very billowy. i wo"
11723	Got for a mother  day gift.  think  she will like it because she always at the beach and is very happy go lucky new mother.
11724	I was immediately drawn to this top in the catalog. when my local retailer had it in stock and in my size, i tried it on. it fit so well - the front wasn't too low and the back was fantastic with its multiple straps. i wore it the same week to a dinner with friends. i like the multiple prints and the navy blue edging. i bought the turquoise necklace too because it topped off the look so well. the fabric is silky but washable. the top is very well made and fun to wear.
11725	Initially, i bought this because i liked the color and style of this trench coat. i thought it could look very chic and polished. the problem was it was too large and too wrinkly. i'm 5'2 (115 lbs) and ordered an xs because petite sizes were unavailable. but i realize that a petite xs would've been a better fit. also the sleeves were too long even with an xs. i've already returned the product.
11726	I need t-shirts, these seem cute. a small runs loose, but it's comfortable and it does fit. i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brand's printed tees. if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist, because these shirts are cut generously, the little slits just throw the whole look off. i tried a few in the store, but left them all there.
11727	This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.
11728	I had high hopes for this coat, but it was a miss for me. while the wool is soft and not itchy, the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy.  also, the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located.  i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was, but alas, i just could not get over the poor tailoring.  for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs) and it was big.
11729	I thought the colors would be brighter and i didn't realize the lace would be see through. i returned it because it was also shorter that i expected. but overall it was a nice dress, just not for me.
11730	Love this! so colorful and cute! will look great with shorts this summer, and will keep me cool in the city in the summer heat. thanks retailer!
11731	Love the fabric. comfortable to wear with jeans or a dress. good for those cool fall mornings.
11732	I was drawn to this blouse because it was silk and looked so well made. the color palette is an added bonus. i knew for my height to size up because it looked short. i tried on the 12 & felt it was still to short. i would have to wear a 14 or 16 to get the length i would like. i think overall this would be a great buy for a person with a smaller bust or shorter. i am 5'8 1/2 & a 36d.
11733	I've been stalking this top online and finally went into the store today to see it.  i'm so glad i did!  the colors are very vibrant and the material is soft and very lightweight.  the cut covers a regular bra pretty well (a big plus!) and makes my arms look good!  i can't wait to wear this, it will be a perfect dressy top for the higher heat days!
11734	Omg so i never pay full price for a t-shirt because it's just a t-shirt but there are exceptions for every rule. i can't believe i am saying this but this shirt was worth it! it is true to size (a relaxed fit) so if you are in between sizes, you could comfortably size down. the colors are just so darling. love this. not disappointed.
11735	Other reviews are right, it is a little short in front. but it's such an adorable dress that i don't care! i love the material. super soft.
11736	This is a beautiful blouse. great colors and detailing - i absolutely love the design in the back. will look great with white skinny jeans. it does run a bit on the short side but i have a long torso and it still works. i waffled between the 6 and 8 (am usually an 8 and a full b cup).  in sleeveless tops i really like the arm holes to be snug enough to cover that unattractive part between the underarm and breast, so i was considering the 6 but ultimately decided the 8 did so with a bit more comf
11737	I love this top, the beachy print is very cute. my only complaint is that it does run large, it is definitely not a fitted t-shirt; and bought the medium and it's a little baggy on me. i'm hoping that a wash and dry will shrink it up a bit. if not, that's okay, still very cute.
11738	I like this layer for fall for many reasons. first of all, the color is a beautiful fall color. the design of the vest is flattering when wore with skinny jeans or leggings. the weight of the vest is perfect for the cooler weather. it is not too heavy, it's fairly lightweight. i am a size 6 and the small fit perfectly.
11739	"Flowy, comfy plaid dress perfect for the fall or winter. front is much shorter than the back - at 5'8"" the front is nearly too short on me, but works with a pair of tights. dress has a cami slip underneath, which is needed as the blue detailing across the chest and down the center is sheer, adding to how special the dress is. can be made more or less casual based on accessories and footwear!"
11740	"I just think this dress is so cute! i love it with booties!  here are the fit details: i'm 5'4 1/2"" and the front of the dress hits just above my knees. (i was concerned that it would be too short for my lifestyle based on the photo). the sleeves roll up and have a tab to button, however the button is very low. therefore, the sleeve rolls up not mid arm, but actually about three inches above my wrist! (it's still super cute, just nowhere near my elbow. just letting you know). final detail that"
11741	The material is velvety smooth, and not quite so pink as pictured on the website. more of a dusty brown rose. well made, nice fit. flattering on my petite frame. a wonderful third piece to complete or elevate an outfit.
11742	I absolutely love this vest. it fits extremely well and falls nicely. i find the collar/lapel billows or flaps out and away from the interior of the vest and i wish they were sewn or secured down. when you tie the string around your waist, the lapel doesn't lay flat, but if you style it like the online model and tie the string off to tighten around your waist, you get a very flattering look. the color and fabric is great quality and really nice in person. i'm overall really happy with this vest.
11743	These embroidered jeans are very nice. they also exist in a lighter wash which i prefer because it shows off the embroidery better. the embroidery is dark navy which is almost not visible in these darker jeans. i guess if you like something very subtle these jeans are for you. i personally would have like a more contrasting color either white or red for the embroidery. these jeans are loose and expand with wear, it is perfectly ok to size down.
11744	I really wasn't sure if this dress would work for me, so i was very excited when i fell in love with it! i haven't experienced any quality or tearing issues with it as one reviewer noted, thank goodness! i love the color scheme and versatility of this dress. i have worn it with tights, a belt and short-heeled ankle booties to make it a little more dressy. but i most love it with some funky jewelry and leggings, wearing it more tunic style. the slip underneath is a great feature as well! it does
11745	I had to call so many stores to track this shirt down and in the end it wasn't worth it. i got an xs and it was quite baggy. i never buy petite shirts because i feel like they are too short but in this case i think the shirt would have been perfect in whatever the smallest petite size is. for someone who's bigger i'd definitely check this shirt out.
11746	Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful, it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back.
11747	"The fabric on this tee is a very very soft thin cotton knit. it's perfect for those hot, muggy summers esp. in the southern area of the us.   the sizing runs larger. i am normally an xl and because of the other reviews saying it ran big, i got this in a l. and, it fits me fine, and there's room to spare. so, if you are a size 16 or 18, this will fit in a l nicely.  it's thin but i don't think it's immodest or too sheer. a white or beige bra would not show through this easily at all. the leng"
11748	This dress is so pretty on! i almost didn't try it on because on the hanger it didn't look like it would have any shape. well, it is super drapey and flowy, and it looks great on, almost swing style. it is doubled up on fabric, and with the longer sleeves i was scared it would make me too hot, but the fabric is light and breathable, it will be a perfect transitional dress for fall and early spring. fyi, the eyelet strip on the front and back are see through, didn't realize that the first time i
11749	The colors and fabric on this dress are really pretty. the lace is a soft blue instead of white. i have other dresses like this from this brand and really wanted to keep it, but it runs larger than the others i have. also, it doesn't have pockets. if it fits you properly, i think you will love it!
11750	I bought the white with the colorful stripes. i am not disappointed. the sleeves are rolled and tacked. it seems to run a little big in the torso. all in all, a great summer tee.
11751	This was just not flattering for me--looked too much like a maternity dress. i can't really do a belted waist so perhaps that would make this dress more versatile for someone else. i was sorry to have to return because it goes well with sandals and boots!
11752	"Love it. got a lot of compliments with it. buy it, it's worth it especially with the sale price right now."
11753	Love this vest. to be fair i've never met a vest i didn't like, though! this color is so versatile! i have tried it with many retailer dresses and it looks awesome with each one. this vest has made my bailey 44 gathered stripes dress church appropriate :) i am happy with my purchase at sale price.
11754	The top is cute, but when i received it, it did not feel like cotton. the tag says 100% viscose. i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future! on the plus side, the return was no problem.
11755	I thought this was a pretty and unique top. the material looks and feels like a basic t-shirt made into a striking fitted top. this isn't apparent in the online pictures: the side seams are slitted open nearly up to the waist, so it is a bit revealing. my only problem with this shirt was that the bottom part flared out too much away from my body, and there is a lot of material there, so i wasn't sure if i could get it tailored to look good on me.
11756	"These relaxed fit jeans are super soft. they do run a size large, i am a size 26 in the stilt style and the 25 in these fit well with a little ""room""."
11757	As cute in person as the picture shows. good quality, worth the money!
11758	"After a long wait for this dress to come in. i finally received it! the wait was worth it!  the colors and pattern are just like they are online. the length comes right to to the top of my knees...i am 5'7"". a couple of things to note: the sleeves are narrow,. if you have skinny arms, no problem. the fit across the bust is snug enough that if you have a large bust, there will probably be a gap at the buttons. there are gathers at the shoulder giving the sleeve a slight puffed shoulder. if you"
11759	My favorite jeans i have ever purchased! they fit just right. i wear them everywhere.
11760	I hadn't seen this sweater/jacket online or in store before shopping today. i purchased the ivory. it fits without being bulky whether or not it is zipped. great fit- true to size.the asymmetric zipper is a stylish detail. the pockets are well placed also. it is a perfect spring weight jacket or, i suspect, a comfy fall to winter sweater.
11761	I'm so disappointed. the dress looked lovely in the box, but when i started to unbutton it to try it on, two buttons split in half! it's going right back.
11762	Love these jeans for summer! i followed the advice of previous reviewers and sized down to a 26. after wearing these for a few hours they stretched a little and fit great!! they look sweet with the palo alto blouse and the embroidered edessa top. highly recommend!
11763	The peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage, not at my natural waist, so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up. i am busty so it's possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem. i was disappointed to return it, the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one.
11764	I ordered this dress in a size 8, my normal size at retailer. it is a lovely dress and so feminine, but it is incorrectly sized. i couldn't begin to button it. i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything. buyer beware. unless you are itsy bitsy, you need to size up. i will say that as pretty as the photos are, the dress is even more lovely in person.
11765	I've been eyeing this for months and finally bit the bullet and am so happy i did before it sold out! i love it. i was afraid i couldn't pull it off because i'm 5'3 and very petite, but i don't think it matters. it feels so light and airy and i can't wait to wear it at the pool and the beach as well as over some white tank tops and jean shorts. great piece.
11766	I really wanted to love this dress but it was not right for me.   made my curvy body look shapeless.  also had a button crack before i even put it on.  returned it.
11767	"This dress is indeed so lovely in person. i am so glad i ordered 2 sizes (0p and 2p) based on the straighter-looking cut. i am 115 lbs, 5'1.5"", adn 30dd bra size. verdict, the 2p fit better. why, the cehst area is a little snug and hte buttons kept trying to open (and did# i would have ahd to leave it pen and wear a tank under this dress... not an option with such a unique piece.  other things: color: wow, very nice in person, i was afraid that the colr would wash me out, but no, i have very p"
11768	I tried these on to compare with a different style and didn't like this one a much (also ag brand). these fit better at the waist, but seemed long on me and made me look frump ear. i think they are really comfortable, adn on the longer legs would be great. buy f you are taller than 5 foot 1.5 inches:-). (reference, i am 115 lbs and tried on the 25)
11769	Really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type. also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me.
11770	The blue on this jumpsuit is actually a little darker than pictured. it's very cute on but i would order a size down for a more fitted look. my usual 0 petite had some extra fabric that layed awkwardly on my body.
11771	I would wear this everyday if i could. the red color is so rich and the cut and structure of the top is perfect and flattering. i've worn to work, out, or dressed down with jeans and flip flops.
11772	The only thing i didn't like about this is i wish it was a little bit shorter, but otherwise great! throw it on with pants and add a bit of color and spring/summer'ness to your outfit!
11773	"I've never spent this much on a pair of jeans, but per another customer review that they were ""worth every penny"" i took the plunge. so glad i did. and also glad i sized down one size. be careful when you put them on - i keep putting my toe through the hole at the knee!"
11774	Maeve is hands down my favorite clothing brand so i am a little biased but this is just the cutest top! i saw so many pics of this top in the gallery that i had to have it. i waited for it to go on sale and ordered it in my usual size 6 which normally is perfect in maeve tops. this is just a little snug in the shoulders but not enough to send back for an exchange. if your on the fence, go for it!
11775	I love this top...i waited for it to go on sale, and it was well worth it. it has a peplum bottom and it is slightly longer in the back. i found it to be true to size but if you are going to but reaching up, the arms do run a little tight. overall, the mock neck, button closure on the back, and the feminine flare of this top create a beautiful classic look
11776	I was so excited to get these. i paid for two day shipping and ordered medium and large . sadly they did not fit. i usually wear medium but ordered both just in case. i'm very disappointed that they run so small and are not true to size. they are super cute from someone skinny.
11777	Awesome jeans. cute and comfortable! size down as they run a little big.
11778	"I wore this jumpsuit to a newport wedding and got so many compliments! i'm 5'2"" 105 lbs and the 0 petite was perfect with heels."
11779	This dress is beautiful. it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it. i usually wear a size 8 in retailer but because it was a button down dress, i ordered a size 10. the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button. it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season.
11780	I love this shirt! it is classic and elegant. it is versatile and can go with lots of different things. be mindful, it is see-through so you must wear a tank underneath. i got it in white and it can be dressed up or down. i like how the sleeves are slightly longer than your average shirt. definitely recommend.
11781	
11782	"I'm 5'5"" and i think fairly proportioned (120 lbs, 34b) and the peplum hit well above my waist. since having kids i'm a little obsessive about avoiding any shirt that could double as maternity... and this struck me as one. it's a cute too, but once it's on i don't feel it's very flattering."
11783	As soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging, i feel in love with them. the fabric was so soft - i could not wait to get them on...yeah, that was not going to happen! i could not pull them on - not even a little bit! these pants run incredibly small. i ordered them twice: once in my regular size, and again in a larger size. unfortunately, i am sized out of these beauties.
11784	This top is a departure from my usual style, but i had to give it a try because it looked so comfy yet structured. i wish the material was less sheer as i have to wear a cami underneath when i wear it to work. i'm 5'3 / 135lb and the 6 fits just fine.
11785	"This is a gorgeous dress, but i did title my review ""worth the trouble"" because of the buttons which a few other people mentioned. i ordered this from the website and when i tried it on at home, a button snapped right in half. my mother put on all new buttons that were stronger but look exactly the same. of course, i shouldn't have to do that to be able to wear the dress, but i love eyelet and was willing. the new buttons cost about $2.00 so not a big deal in the end.  i agree with another revi"
11786	The design and quality were great. i really wanted them to fit but they ran large. i'm 5'4 and 120 lbs and orderd the small. unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i won't be trying a size down. the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward. sadly these went back.
11787	This was a gift for a bachelorette. very pretty and sexy without being too over the top. love the print!
11788	Absolutely adore this dress. details, fabric and deep pockets. here is the caveat at least for me. i am a typical size 6 and ordered the dress in a size 8 for a little looser, casual fit. the 8 is so small i can barely place over my shoulders and cannot button. i have reordered a size 12 and 14. perhaps the dress i received is not tagged properly. so disappointed as the item is on backorder.
11789	This top is the very same top meadow rue had a couple of years ago. i have that top and it is identical so my guess is meadow rue and deletta are owned by the same company.
11790	I was looking for a dress that would make me feel as special as i would feel when i attend my daughter's baby shower. this design, featuring a variety of spring influenced flower motifs embossed upon an eyelet fabric, was exactly what my mind's eye envisioned! the use of the solid colored shirtdress button line and cuffs softly pulled all the elements of this unique work beautifully together. i found the fit to be almost costumed made for my figure. the number of compliments i received on the da
11791	I ordered these in the taupe which is more like a rust color. they are really cute on, but they run a little big and long, so i had to return them. they would be great casual pants for the weekend though if the color and fit were better.
11792	This is about the cutest thing since...well i don't know but it's pretty cute. yes, i agree with the other reviewer who said it looked better in hand than on the web! has cute, soft ruffle just above hip and the stripes are soft pastels. the buttons at the nape of the neck are sweet. there's the word-sweet-that's the perfect descriptive for this quirky, laid back, feminine piece. tts-nothing weird or uncomfortable about the fit but it does seem a bit shorter than the picture shows. i am 140 lbs
11793	
11794	This jacket is extremely soft and comfortable, with a heavier textured fabric. i think it is expensive for what it is--$138--probably best to wait for a sale
11795	"I saw this en route to the dressing room at an retailer store and picked it up to try on. despite the store only carrying this in petites, i tried it on anyway and didn't want to take it off! it's very wearable and comfortable. the sides have boning which keeps the fabric from riding up or down. i have a little postpartum tummy and the shape and pattern conceals that nicely.   i'm 5'6, 160 lbs, and 36c. i typically wear a 10 and bought this in a 10p. the length, waist and bust fit perfectly."
11796	I'm super happy with the way these jeans fit. i typically buy ag jeans for fit and quality. this pair is extremely comfy with the right amount of stretch yet still somewhat relaxed. they do run a big large so i sized down and they still fit great... lots of compliments!
11797	This top is a keeper. subtle plaid, flowy fit. so cute with skinny jeans and booties. i would definitely recommend!
11798	I had been looking at the dresses and jumpsuits from this designer for a while and decided to order this jumpsuit. i'm usually an extra small in jumpsuits, and wasn't sure to get the 0petite or 2petite. i'm 5'3 and about 115 lbs and the 2 petite is perfect in the legs and waist, but a little wide across the chest (i'm a 32c). the material is soft and feels very nice and like good quality. it's perfect for dressing up a little in the summer and i'm going to think of ways to transition it to the f
11799	I ordered this online, and was pleasantly surprised when i received it. i'm about 5'5 and 140 lbs and the small fit perfectly. it is very flattering, and i can't wait to wear it!
11800	My main complaint, is that the button holes are too tight for such delicate buttons. one button shattered when i tried to get it undone, and what's even more crazy, is that mine did not come with any extras. so i guess i'll have to go to the fabric store to find a match. (i'll be sure to get a bunch just in case) a couple of minor notes; it smells like chemicals, and i won't be able to wear a bra, because the chest is a tad tight. however, the dress is cute enough, that i'll deem it worthy to we
11801	This is a truly beautiful jacket that goes with so much - dressed up or even over something casual. and either way it is comfortable without looking frumpy, soft and conforms to your shape without being sloppy. i would say it does have more of a 'sweater' feel to it but with the zipper can easily pass as a jacket. it's lightweight but enough to keep you warm on a spring or fall day. i would say it fits pretty true to size. i got the ivory during the big weekend sale (extra 40% off) but even at $
11802	I saw this dress online, and i thought it was perfectly cute! however, once i tried it on at home, it just didn't work. one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning, and once i got it on, the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm. (i'm 5'7'' and ~126 lbs and purchased in size 2). i didn't even try buttoning all the way. i took it back, and i don't even think i want a larger size. the buttons are just too fragile.
11803	This is a 3-season item that can function as a cardigan or a jacket and will look equally good with jeans or with work slacks. the seaming gives it a bit of structure. the asymmetrical zipper gives it a little twist. the texture gives it interest. i bought it in navy and i'm considering the ivory.
11804	"The cotton, the print, and the online presentation of this dress are beautiful, i ordered right away! but there are some discrepancies. the shoulders have a ""puff"" to them that i don't notice on the model, and that doesn't flatter athletic shoulders. the buttons are (cheap) difficult to button. the waist sits much lower on the model than it must on anyone else, it's nearly empire on me. and, there is a lot more volume in the skirt of the dress than is shown in any photo. because the dress is tig"
11805	This is a lovely dress. it is on the heavy side and lined, so i would not recommend for hot summer wear. but the material and style are adorable. the skirt is definitely a-line, not sheath, but i prefer that. it runs a tad too tight in the chest, so if you're between sizes in the bust, i'd order up. that said, a 6 would be too big for me. i'm 5'4, 120 lbs and 34c and usually wear a 4.
11806	While i agree with the previous review that the peplum hits a bit high, i like this top. it has other features that i really like. the dip in the back of the peplum is great and i love the longer sleeves. i have it in both the black and the mauve and they are becoming quick staples in my wardrobe. i have a fuller figure and feel good in this top.
11807	Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.
11808	This top is great for those days when you have nothing to wear. just throw this on and get ready for the compliments!
11809	Looks exactly as it does in the pictures. very comfortable, loose flowing, and has a slip underneath it. i'm personally a little hesitant to buy clothes online because it's always a guessing game when it comes to figuring out what size. with that, i have wide hips/big thighs so i tend to vary between medium and large, but thankfully the medium fits like a glove!
11810	This top looks better on than on the hanger. i've been looking for a feminine plaid top and this is the one! it's a flirty and innocent look in one. i would say size up. it runs a little tight around the upper arm, shoulders area when stretching arms out. i normally wear a size 2-4 depending on the top and the 6 felt better.
11811	I am 5'4 and 120 lbs and ordered a size 0. the dress fit perfectly in the shoulders and arms and below the waist, but i could barely fit my 32a size chest in the dress! the other reviewers are not kidding about the chest area being very narrow. i have had to order a size 2 instead. we'll see if that works.
11812	I wanted to love this blouse, but the peplum came too high up on my waist. i have a short torso and i'm busty, so the placement of the peplum just didn't work for me. it is a very pretty color and fit fine in my normal size, but the peplum just didn't work on my short torso. i think this would be a very pretty blouse for people with a different body type than mine.
11813	Mom loves these and she looks great going to the gym! the cut-outs are so cute!
11814	"Really like this dress but..... the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes. impossible! has to go back"
11815	"Super cute, casual top. i'm usually a medium and this fit perfectly (5'9"" 145 lbs). it's not quite as long as it is on the model, but cute nonetheless."
11816	"I loved this dress the moment i saw it, pre-ordered it, but when it arrived the fit was off.  i am almost always a size 4p in retailer clothing, this fit wonderfully everywhere, except the shoulders and chest were very small. i am 5'2"" and 120 lb with a small bosom. (a cup) the shoulders were too tight and the chest gaped and sadly i had to return this dress. i may try to find it in the store to try on multiple sizes for the right fit."
11817	"I saw this top online and loved it. i wasn't sure about sizing and because i don't live near a store i decided to order two sizes. i'm 5'8"" and typically wear an 8 or medium in tops. the 8 in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders. i sized up to a 10 and it fit beautifully!"
11818	I am a brand loyal ag fan. best washes, best pocket placement and these are no exception. they do run a little big. i usually wear a 26 or 27 in the stilts depending on the fabric content. i tried these in the 26 and 25. both fit, but i went with the 25 because these will stretch at least 1/2 size. the distressing is the right amount, however i gave 4 stars because one area is directly over the knee which i don't care for. solved it by having a seamstress reinforce the back of it with a similar
11819	This is a cute dress, but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on. i can't risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it. especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup, anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle.
11820	I wanted to love this dress. the wool is lightweight yet warm and drapes beautifully. the plaid print is rich, however it is much darker in color than shown in the photos. the dress runs very large. i ordered it in my typical size and it was too big. dolman sleeve dresses usually look great on me, but the cut of this dress, while beautiful, was nothing remarkable. for as expensive as it is it would have had to be an amazing dress for me to keep it. sadly it didn't quite make the cut. it's a sham
11821	
11822	"I love this dress and had so hoped to wear it to a wedding in june. the fabric is a perfect weight, very nice cotton, i only wish i could have kept it. i am 5'3"", 133 lbs and usually wear a size 6 which is what i ordered. it was fine in the skirt but the top was at least a size if not two sizes too small for 32 chest. i did not want to wear it open with a tee and so had to send it back. the wedding date does not allow for the new available date for the dress."
11823	I wanted to love this dress. sadly, the styling was wrong. the stripes on the bottom half did not line up with the top and the pleats didn't help. it just threw everything off and made me look distorted.
11824	Beautiful! color is true to pictures. no stretch. no liner. looks good with white or nude tank.
11825	Super soft and comfy. so far not stretching out but still recommend buying down a size.
11826	I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber, ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.
11827	This dress is unique and lovely! it is a one of a kind dress. i found it to be true to size. the only downside is the quality of the buttons.
11828	I'm keeping this dress but it's going straight to the dry cleaner because right out of the bag it has a very strong chemical smell... like it had been stored in a gas station. then, i'm replacing all the buttons. the fabric is a thick eyelet, folded over with these teeny, thin shell buttons that are a complete design fail. two were broken right out of the package. also, i'm a size 0 in most retailer dresses and this dress has plenty of room in the waist, almost too much space, but the top... i hav
11829	"This is a very comfortable dress. i absolutely love the design, the feel (structured and has weight), and the 3/4 sleeves. perfect dress for brunch and work. the fit is not giving in the chest area. i needed to go up a size due to the inflexibility of the material; even tried it without a bra.... nope, wasn't a happening. i ordered a size up and love it!  the only con are the buttons. they are very thin and not a good choice for the heavy fabric. broke one in the fitting room!"
11830	
11831	The nolan's are my favorite pair of jeans from any brand. they are skinny leg but not too tight and the material is oh so soft. i buy 1-2 sizes down as they stretch out a lot.
11832	Love this timeless piece, but it was a bit looser fitting than i expected. i consistently wear xs, so i had an idea of how i thought it would fit. i still kept it though, because you can dress it up or down and it will never go out of style!
11833	I loved this dress and i am usually a 2 or 4 in dresses. this was cut too small on the bust. i'm a 32c and it pulled at the chest. i didn't re-order it because i felt it would look more like a house dress and be too baggy in the hips.
11834	This top is perfect to dress up and dress down. pair it with high wasted pants and you are set!
11835	I got this sweater in white and i love it. the photo online doesn't do it justice, it's not frumpy at all and looks looks great zipped up because of the slanted zipper. my boyfriend calls it my claire underwood sweater.
11836	"This dress has a flattering and fitted cut which perfectly compliments the unique eyelet fabric. it is at once elegant yet casual, perfect for the office or better yet, afternoon tea in a far flung british colony of yesteryear. which brings me to the buttons - putting on this dress makes one wish one had a ladies maid, but the effort is well worth it for this stunner of a dress. as others have said, it runs small and tight in the chest and is not for the well endowed. i am a petite 5'2"" and fit"
11837	This is a wonderful top! the fabric is soft and comfortable, with a beautiful drape. the pattern is very pretty, the curved hems are very flattering, and the top is versatile. it can be worn with shorts, as shown, or a skirt with a belt or pants. i have pilcro wide leg pants in orange, yellow and green, and this top looked amazing with all of them. a great little find!
11838	Love this tank, i am petite and this was the perfect length for me, i wore it with white jeans and a blazer.  love the print!
11839	Super cute and comfortable! soft fabric drapes nicely. i wear this with an orange skirt, white shirts or jeans. i get lots of compliments on this top and get more use out of it than expected! i'm so glad i tried it on! a nice surprise.
11840	
11841	Beautiful dress! beautiful color and design. as the other reviewer says, it has an expose good quality gold color zipper on the back that doesn't show in the picture, however, it adds to its style and beauty! i love the dress and so happy that found it in my size finally!
11842	These shorts are great, both the design and fit are beautiful. i would say that these run true to size, i bought my usual size, 26, and they fit perfectly. they fit a little high waisted, which i love. the material is so soft and are so comfortable. i would recommend these shorts if you're thinking about it!
11843	It's simply a super cute and versatile jumpsuit. you can wear it as is or over a shirt or t-neck. drapes well, hangs well. looks good from the front and the back. i am 5-5, 120 lb, size 4 fits perfectly. only drawback, has to be dry cleaned...
11844	"So pretty and flattering. it's my new favorite blouse. it's also really comfortable. i do not tuck this one in. i love the knit material makes it extra comfy and breathable. the colors are very pretty and wearable. the quality and cratsmanship are impressive. it has a straight bottom hem and slight boxy cut which i like. i am 5'3"" and weight 126 lbs. i ordered the small , but i was going go a slightly bigger comfy fit. i couldn't be happier with this purchase."
11845	Love this top. got xs fits perfectly. wish it came in more designs
11846	"Beautiful shorts. i'm 5'3"" 130 lbs and athletic/muscular build. the 4 fit perfect which is my true size. great print that will go with plenty of different colors. i feel like you can dress it up or go more casual."
11847	Tried this on to see if the size works in regular size, and i love the fir, it si very feminine and flattering. i will have to go back for it. both apttenrs are really nice, and it also comes in balck in my store.  neckline is super flattering.
11848	I ordered this top in xl in the navy print. it fits true to size. it's made of two very soft materials. the printed part looks like sailboats to me. it doesn't wrinkle or have a static problem. the solid knit portion is a good quality too. i love the styling details of the ruffled neck and the middle pleat. it's flattering. i like how the details make this a dressy version of a t-shirt while being very comfortable too.
11849	
11850	
11851	This jumpsuit has the best fit i could ever imagine for a jumpsuit. jumpsuits are always tricky for me, but this one fits like a dream. i would say it runs true to size, with the exception of being a little bit big in the chest. you could go braless with this jumpsuit as there are nice little cups for the girls, but i put on a strapless bra just to fill out the top part. that's not typically a problem for me being a 32d. i don't think i could size down though or it would be too tight in the wais
11852	I am not really a fan of jumpsuits/rompers/etc. but i love this jumpsuit. very good quality and design. fits well, but i thought the 4 was pretty large for a 4. i mean, i probably should have gotten a 2 (which was sold out), but i don't usually have to get a 4 tailored. i did in this case, but it was still worth it.
11853	These pants are fabulous ! i want more colors ! and i got them on sale !!
11854	I will find myself reaching for this top time and time again
11855	I tried these on in a 6 which is my usual size in bottoms that are not designer jeans and they fit ok. they were a little short waisted but i have a long torso. sizing up to an 8 helped but then they were fairly wide in the legs. they are meant to flare out a bit i believe but it was too much for me. i like them but i don't love.
11856	Great cut and high quality fabric. the top gives you a nice hourglass shape and i love the way it hangs half-way down your butt.
11857	I purchased the blue one - it's a very brilliant royal blue. nice color. the patterned portion is quite heavy, which provides a nice drape. hangs really well without being clingy or too loose. great top for jeans.
11858	I got the purple version in a xs. i purchased it on sale so it was a great deal. i usually don't wear large prints but i loved the print and the ruffle detail. very feminine. it also hides the tummy roll, so that is always a plus! i've worn it a few times and threads are already unraveling, but easy fix.
11859	This is a cute top and i did not even need my usual petite size thanks to the 3/4 length sleeves. i liked the semi-abstract sailboat pattern and the style is comfortable to wear. however, the tie at the neckline didn't appeal to me so ultimately i did not buy it.
11860	"This must be the only structured t shirt at retailer at the time of this review. i love it. the neckline is perfection. the ruched sleeves are long enough to cover my upper arms. i found it a bit see through, and added a white cami.  sizing: i ordered an xs. normally i wear a small in retailer brands, and a med in most other brands. size small t's have been too large lately. i'm 5'5"" tall, 135 lbs, 35-29-36, 34d, long torso, narrow across the shoulders, and short arms.   fit: loose fitting t's l"
11861	"An adorable tank...wearing it right now! fits this curvy girl well, though may consider wearing a tank underneath, as the keyhole does show a bit of cleavage. if in between sizes, consider sizing down. perfect print for summer."
11862	"I am a jumpsuit convert. i tried it on ""just in case,"" but was amazed at how easy and effortlessly adorable it is. i purchased the black, petite 4, and love that it is super versatile in terms of seasonality and styling options. i have an hourglass figure and the draping and fit of the piece work very well."
11863	This was my first time to try this brand and they fit so well and are super comfortable. i love the pockets also. i am 5'1, 108 and i got a 2p and they fit just right.
11864	I put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old. he was right. i'm not sure if it's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too. perhaps on someone else it would look different. the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking. it may look better on someone taller.
11865	"I bought this top in lavender. this top is light and smooth on your body and true to size. i'm 5'4"", 34dd, 150 lbs- m fits well. it hides the imperfections in the tummy area and i find myself going for this top a lot. it's a very easy to put on and take to it off."
11866	One of the worst shirts i've tried in a long time. i don't know how they managed to give it a little shape on the model. in person it is sleeveless, huge, short and wide.
11867	Love the print and comfort of this tank, however, it does run about 2 sizes larger than normal. it is also not a fitted tank, it has some flow which is not exactly what i was looking for.
11868	I really can't say enough about them. they have the perfect amount of stretch, are so comfortable and they keep their shape really well. i would say that you could wear them 3 times before washing. also, the color is perfect. they are tts and even allow for a little extra holiday weight without becoming a torture device.
11869	Since there isn't one where i live, i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up. saw this and bought it off the rack w/out trying on. had to get a m as they were out of s, and yes, it's a tad large on me, but still glad i got it. i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas. love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee. the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch.
11870	"I tried this on in the store on a whim. it is so flattering, soft, and pretty. i generally wear a size 12 and bought a l although the m might have fit, also: it's got plenty of room. the chiffon yoke is not particularly sheer and a nude bra strap is basically invisible, the jersey is adequately opaque so no camisole needed. my dimensions are about 40""  bust x 33"" waist."
11871	"I've been stalking this beauty since it came out and when i saw it went on sale with an extra percent off code i knew i had to purchase. well worth the price i paid, a bit steep at full price.   i went with a size medium- i usually take a small/2-4 in retailer tops and these days i'm around a 32c. i'm also tall with long arms. the design is very forgiving with the cropped sleeve and non-closing front so you have some wiggle room. it fits me like it was custom made.   the material is a lightwei"
11872	I purchased the blue version in store. it's a nice royal blue, not navy. (although the it could be worn with navy.) i thought the fit was flattering. the middle piece (pleat?) is less obvious on the blue than the purple. the tie at the neck can be untied and it is still not too low cut.
11873	"Note: the inseam runs a little longer than stated above. if you are truly a 29"" inseam, you may want to get the petite size. i purchased the petite small, my inseam is 27"", and the trousers hit the ground in stocking feet. however, the length can be changed depending on where you wear/place them on your hip. i've worn these trousers at home and around town with ease. they are a wonderful cold weather, go-to wardrobe staple. i wear a nylon trouser ""slip"" with them to prolong the need for cleaning"
11874	I saw this in my local store last night and was instantly drawn to the color. it is more greenish than yellow. i say this alot but this was so much prettier in person. i would not look twice at it online- the picture does it no justice. i am not a pancho person, but this looks very luxurious and expensive and it feels so soft and warm. i tried the xs/s and it fit perfect - i am typically a medium in other brands at antrho. it is boxy, but that is the point of a sweater of this type. it will be p
11875	I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo, i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it, however, it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge, i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment, i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.
11876	"Great causal tank! the back is a bitter longer than the front - i'm 5'6"" and the back-model shot was right on for where it his me at the hip/butt. the material is a poly/spandex/rayon mix that feels predominately like polyester and rayon and has a little bit of give.   i go between a medium and small in most retailer tanks and like to achieve a look that is somewhere in between form-fitting and flowy (quick stats - 130 lbs, 34c) and the small was perfect without being too tight across the chest."
11877	"I can't wait for our warmer weather to arrive here in minnesota so i can wear this lovely tank top. the style is so flattering, it doesn't bag out to make you look pregnant. the back yoke is solid navy blue chiffon which is a nice touch. soft fabric, drapes beautifully. the armholes are not oversized. the fabric is opaque so no camisole required.  i am 5'5"" and 120 lbs. and 36a. i purchased size small."
11878	I ordered this online and was surprised to see yellow in the pattern when it arrived. i can't see that in the online photo. i didn't like the pattern at all when i saw it for real. the shirt is very loose, fits much like the model photo (i ordered a small, 5'6 140lbs). just looks kind of frumpy and the pleat down the front makes the front hang heavily.
11879	The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.
11880	Love it. goes well with a lot. super soft
11881	Beautiful colors. lovely style. feminine and has a nice flow. fiattering fit in back also. nice holiday blouse. really very pretty.
11882	This is a beautiful color and nice heavier fabric. love the style. armholes not too big. the body is loose fitting at torso but chest area is fitted at 36 c size small . i love this top with skinny jeans or pencil skirt as shown on model. top looks just like it does on model as far as fit.
11883	Fabric is so comfy! color is gorgeous! fit is flattering for large chests.
11884	This top is an amazing go to piece, and yes i have all the colors i could grab my hands onto. i will say, that under the arms small little balls of fabric begin to appear with wear. therefore, it will need a quick once over with your sweater shaver from time to time. good staple for a great price.
11885	The fabric is lovely, color was great, but unfortunately it ran a bit large. this might be a case of girls with boobs vs. girls without. i have a small chest so for me, this just didn't stay in place. i was worried about the arms squeezing me so i got a small rather than my usual xs. bad choice. the diamond in the middle pooches out rather than hugging your body (which was what i was hoping for). when i raise my arms the whole shirt ends up riding up. pretty awkward. there's also a lot of fabric
11886	I thought this top was absolutely beautiful online, and it doesn't disappoint in person. the fabric is divine, and i just love the paisley design. after putting it on though, it did look just a tad boxy, but not enough to return it. i would definitely recommend the top, and maybe a cute belt to accompany!
11887	I really like this top. i am usually a medium in retailer clothing and so i ordered this in medium. it did not fit right across my chest, the empire part cut right across my breast and not underneath like it is supposed to. i returned the top for a large and it fits just right in that area. other than that this top is light and airy, flowy and pretty. i love it!
11888	Lovely silky top (100% poly). i typically look better in more cool tones. this top is neutral enough that i could pull it off. it really has three very pretty, complimentary patterned fabrics. the front v is very deep and the arm holes are quite roomy so either size down or plan on wearing a cami to conceal cleavage and bra.
11889	I had a hard time deciding to order red or turquoise, as both colors are really nice in person. the black, of course, is a classic. another reviewer found the top to be small, but i found it to be a little big on me in my usual size. not too bad, but a little bigger than expected.  teh neck part is effortless as there is stiching to help the colw effect stay in place. the fabric is thin though, so may show things (thinking bra ripples, and perhaps some other ripples in front tummmy). keeping it
11890	I like the fabric and aesthetic of this top, and really wanted to like it, however i wish it were longer. i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes, but even the medium felt short and clingy. however that might be because i'm curvy with a long torso, so i'd definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online!
11891	True to size neckline is not too low so it's great for work got the red and it's a lush deep color quite happy with this purchae
11892	This is a very comfy dress/tunic. i like to wear it with leggings. washed well, nice color, looks nice with boots. nice find!
11893	
11894	The pattern and colors are very pretty, and the material is soft and silky. i returned it, though, because it is very low-cut in the front. it comes down to between my breasts, which is not going to work for me.
11895	This is a beautiful tunic dress and the detail makes it so soft and feminine. i would never have bought it online because it looks so plain but in the store today just couldn't believe how pretty. i'm mature so i plan to wear with black leggings and a nice scarf but could easily be worn alone or with jeans. i think it will transition into spring for two season wear. i'm small but large busted (size 6, 32 h bra)and the small was perfect. can't wait to wear it!
11896	"I am pleased with this modal cowl neck top; it is a very basic but is a nice addition to my wardrobe. the cowl is just right-not overly 'chunky' or awkward; it drapes nicely and lies flat against my chest. this blouse 'softens' the face-just what i was looking for-i needed a soft-looking black tee to go with a skirt i have and wanted a bit 'more' than a basic tee but nothing overly frilly or ruffled. this blouse filled the bill quite nicely. it is a very soft modal fabric and fits tts. i am 5'5"""
11897	"Like the idea but the tee was was very boxy. i tried the size small and it fit at the shoulders but the body was very big. i would say they pinned it for the product photo:) i'm 34a...usually a size small. it was soft and fun but a no for me at this price."
11898	Wasn't sure what to expect - but got this on sale, and glad i did. it is much prettier in person. soft and silky. great fit also - and versatile (mix and match)
11899	I am sure these pants are right for someone, just not me. i am wider in the hips, and they just were really unflatering. the fabric is very lightweight, which i wasn't expecting, and so while the pleats are interesting, with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place. the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise, but i'm used to thinking high waist with wide legs. in short, these pants are probably great on some body types, just not mine. also very long. i'm 5-8 and a

11902	Online this top looks fabulous, but in person, not so great. great color, nice quality for a lightweight top, but when i tried it on, the neck does not lay nicely. too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck ( and i love cowl neck). i found, for me, it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest, so didn't work. for reference, i'm 5'4 118 and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large. i purchased a smal
11903	I saw this jacket in stores, but did not buy it. i went home, but could not get this trendy jacket out of my head. i returned to the store the very next day and purchased this item. i am very pleased with the quality and think that the fit could go well on most body types. i got the denim color, which may not be the best color for all, but i love it because denim is timeless and very versatile. i would suggest this to anyone and could not be happier with this! go out and buy it now, you won't re
11904	I bought this during the 25% off dress sale, but alas it is a chemise and not a dress. nevertheless i love it. in a smaller size (i exchanged an xs for an xxs) it is much more flattering and has more shape. the different fabrics make it interesting and fun.
11905	"This is a lovely dress, the shape is really flattering and it's light and easy to wear. the only problem i have is it runs a little big - i'm normally a 6-8 and i'm sizing down to a 4. otherwise it's pretty perfect, the length is good for taller women (i'm 5'11"") and the bodice is sturdy enough that smaller cup sizes won't need a bra. definitely recommend this!"
11906	This is a great top so beautiful with bright colors and sheen. my only complaint was i am dd and it was tight so i had to size up!  otherwise my brests would spill up and out!.
11907	"I am 5'3"" 28/38 and i ordered the regular s. if i left it the way it came, it would have been low-waisted and too long, so i am having the waist taken in a couple of inches so it is now high waisted and the length is fine with heels. i did not opt to exchange for a smaller size as the derriere fit fine. it anyway does not define your shape much in the rear. agree that fabric is lighter than expected, but the color and drape are nice. it has stitched-in shorts that fall above the knee. i think wi"
11908	I really love this shirt - fits just like the picture shows and runs tts. the color is a beautiful red - a bitter richer/darker in person than it looks online.
11909	Great fir and very flattering. keep in mind that it's a little low cut. some bras may not be low enough or may show.
11910	This is a nice and comfortable shirt. i'm 5'7 and i have triple d size bra and i got my shirt in size m. it fits perfectly and my breasts are not showing too big and the shirt is not too tight. it's more of a casual style, possibly because of the fabric that was made of. nothing fancy but a very nice every-day shirt to go with skinny jeans or a skirt. it covers belly really well and it does look nice and slim around the waist. i'm pretty pleased with my purchase.
11911	This bra is beautiful. the lace is so lovely and soft and looks fabulous on. my only criticism is it runs very small. i am a 32 a and order the size 1 and it is snug... just order a size up (or two) and it should be perfect.
11912	This dress is perfect and so sweet! i do agree with other reviewers in that it runs about 1/2 to one size large. i run anywhere from 6-8 in retailer dresses and i ordered the 6. if you are usually in between sizes definitely order the smaller size. the smaller size also allows me to go braless even though i have a larger (34dd) chest because of the well-constructed bodice. length is nice for us tall girls as well!!
11913	I usually wear a small or medium depending on the cut, but this one only worked in a large. with or without a bra, it was not too low and covers all the middle area flaws beautifully. bust size average and i have muscular (not sticks) arms and a fairly wide back. nice and drapey, pretty green color. great sale price.
11914	I ordered this top in red. gorgeous color and detail, however just wasn't flattering on my more curvy shape. felt like it looked like a maternity top.
11915	"I loved the fabric, cut and style of these shirts, the diamond gather in the front is a problem though. i just went under and snipped the elastic that is sewn on that design to relax it a bit. this shirt washes and wears wonderfully.  please make again  maybe fix the diamond area so it is not sewn with as much continuous elastic, a space in the sewing on both sides would alleviate that pucker.  sill i love this top"
11916	
11917	"Drawn to the colors, i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist, size 10/12 or l in fitted tops this top is a cropped, even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement), but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full, so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up, too. the quality is an issue, with exposed threads and irregular seams."
11918	I love this fabric, it is comfortable and forgiving. as i prefer jewel tone colors and the red is beautiful. i thought the sleeve length on this might be odd, but it's fabulous. the only reason i haven't given it five stars is that i haven't laundered it enough to verify the quality
11919	This shirt is very pretty in person, although more orange than it appears in picture. i got it for 25% off the sale price, which was definitely worth it, but i wouldn't have paid more than that. the back has a soft tshirt jersey material with a gray and white print. the neckline is a little weird, gathers kind of strangely, but other than that, a really pretty top.
11920	Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length, but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well, everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item, but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!
11921	I have literally dozens of deletta tops. just four things to know: very unique/attractive, run large/stretch out (size down), poor quality fabric, and usually low cut.
11922	Very pleased with my purchase! the subtle details within the dress add to its simple elegance. very soft and comfortable; definitely recommend!
11923	This is exactly what i was looking for! a simple black blouse to pair with a bold pair of pants or skirt. falls nicely and the material is quite stretchy making it super comfortable.
11924	This top came in the mail today and did not disappoint. it feels very light and luxurious and the color is just divine. i got the deep red color and it is beautiful. it can be dressed up or dressed down. i ordered my usual small and it fit tts.
11925	"I managed to find this huit eden lagoon fixed straps foam bandeau swimsuit in a size 32c and it fits perfectly. my current measurements are 33-25-37 or 38 hips, and i normally wear a 30d or 32c bra. . i have a longish torso, yet this doesn't ride up. fits like on the model. there is a thin strip of silicone around the back to keep it from sliding down. the v-shape is held by a hard wire, but it doesn't cut in anywhere. the soft black straps are sewn in and not adjustable but do hold their shap"
11926	"This dress is very comfortable. i bought both the small & xsmall and ended up keeping the xsmall i am 5'4"" 125 lbs. 34c"
11927	This is a stylish blouse with classic features as well as quirky features such as pleats and gathers. very flattering fit!
11928	I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers, i didn't find that the top fit small, but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls, but i'm very tall and broad shouldered, so it didn't look as good on me.
11929	Purchased in a small. usually a 4-6-8. i layered over a sleeveless dress and i felt amazing. great for those tighter dresses. the fabric is sheer but not super see through. the tassle in the back is so creative. it closes enough in the back to not look weird. i have so many plans for this piece. black is the perfect color too. the collar colors are perfect too.
11930	I eyed this for so long hoping it would go on sale. i finally bought it during the 20% off retailer members day. sized up from my usual size 4 to avoid the buttons on the bust looking like they were about to burst free. the rest still fits way. i absolutely cannot wait for the next rainy day to wear this!
11931	I had the same problem i usually have with button-front shirts when i tried this on: gapping at the buttons over the bust. i tried on the striped motif in my usual size. it was also a little snug in the underarms, but fit very nicely everywhere else. i just can't justify sizing up to fit my bust when it means i'll have to have the shirt tailored to fit everywhere else.  the stripe pattern and navy pattern (the one with the birds) are true to the online pictures. the black one was disappointing i
11932	I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short, wide, and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it.
11933	"I'm petite and i ordered the smallest size possible online (5'1"" 95lb). i ordered the rain/umbrella pattern which is cute and very ""retailer"" in my opinion. for those who are experiencing ""gapping at the buttons over bust area"" - wear a tank inside and problem is solved! hoping they would come out with cuter prints in the future."
11934	Another great whimsical print by maeve! as of late, this brand has really fallen all over the board for me, but this top had the right fabric, fit, and pattern to hold onto the parrot print. it looks great loose or tucked in. the parrot print has plenty of accent colors to make this match with many things. cute!
11935	This is top makes me feel happy and pretty! with a saturday/sunday black tank or any cami, you will love yourself in it! tts and matches most any skirt! good price too! can wear with skirts or pants.
11936	I had my eye on the umbrella print shirt for a while. i was able to scoop it at a small discount. i typically get a 2 in maeve tops but per the reviews i got a 4, i definitely could have done with a 2 but i'll probably stay with what i have. adorable print, comfortable, well made.
11937	Perfect shirt for a low-key day at the office. bought in the umbrella/rain (white) print. maeve blouses tend to run a little big on me but that's what i love about them. material is nice, recommend hand wash!
11938	Such a cute take on a henley/button down shirt! i first bought the green and blue version in my typical size medium and while it was bigger than i expected it to be i kept it because i liked the oversized/tunic look i got with some skinny jeans and boots. i decided to order this color in a small to get a different look. i'm just as pleased with the fit of the smaller size! i think this size will work better for tucking in and more tailored looks. yea! these shirts are so soft and made of substan
11939	"This shirt looks just like it does in the picture, and my favorite detail was the buttons. i was a little disappointed in the stitching of the front tucks, as it looked sloppy at the ends, but you might find that rustic/charming. this is a great top for spring/summer. i ordered an 8p, and it fit well everywhere except the chest, so i'm returning it. my bust is about 37""(32ddd), and it was slightly too tight. if i go up a size it will probably make me look bigger than i am, nevermind the horizont"
11940	These shorts are divine. the fabric is sturdy and there is a weave of sparkle that i did not perceive from the picture.
11941	This brand has odd fitting of late. i normally wear a m in retailer tops but i had to size up to 12 on this shirt as it was tight across my chest. i am a b cup and had a sports bra on when i tried it. brought it home and tried on with a regular, non pushup bra and it pulls slightly. i might return it because my guess is that it will shrink when washed. otherwise, its a cute tunic style top.
11942	I am rarely disappointed by maeve and this was no exception. i am a 32b and broad shouldered and my normal size 6 fit like a dream. the white print is opaque so no bra see-through. such a cute, fun print! the fabric has a really soft hand too.
11943	This top is so pretty and the fabric is really soft...but, it does fit a little bit small in the bust. i am not extremely large busted but the buttons gap open just a little and it's tight across my back. otherwise, i love this top and the colors are really, really nice.
11944	I had no issues with size or length. i'm 5'9 34c bust and i bought the striped shirt in a 4 and the umbrella print in a 2. the 2 was ever so slightly tight at the second button but i was wearing a heavy cotton cami. i could have worn a 2 in the striped top as well. i am broad shouldered and the shoulder seam in the size 4 dropped a little so there was plenty of room. these shirts are adorable. i usually don't like button downs but this style is very flattering. the material is light and drapes w
11945	I purchased this shirt in the black and it looks great. it fits well and the design with the different color dots adds character. this shirt can be worn with anything and for just about any occasion. thanks retailer for another winner!!
11946	This sweater is beautifully made from quality yarn. if you are between sizes, you might want to order a size down. i usually fit between a size m and l, depending on the brand. in this sweater i took the medium, but i am debating returning for a small as i would prefer a petite length and the sweater is slightly wide across the upper back. i'm hoping it may be restocked as i would buy this sweater again.
11947	Cute top & well constructed. was surprised at the various gatherings i hadn't noticed before ordering, really like the billowy aspect on the bottom. received lots of compliments.
11948	I love this top and bought my usual xs. i don't have any issues with the buttons gaping but am 34b so i'm not a busty girl. i got the adorable umbrella print and living in a rain forest in southeast alaska it could not be cuter.
11949	I also found this blouse fits well and runs true to size. a size 2 was perfect, not too tight and not too full. the umbrellas and raindrops are so cute and bright. i will wear with jeans or dressier slim pants. what fun!
11950	"Based on reviews, i got the medium pink size: 8 petite because some said it was tight in the bust area and pulled at the buttons creating a gap. i'm 5'6"" and 32d. i figured the 8 petite would be big enough in the bust area and the petite would be shorter. it was too big and even though it was petite, still too long. wanted to like it, but at full price, decided to return."
11951	I bought the umbrella print in the petite length. i'm pleased with the whimsical print and crisp colors. the fit is just right for me, although the style runs a bit wide at the waist. it's a casual loose fit, more fitted on top at the bust, shoulders and sleeves, and flaring out below the waist. i would wear it untucked over jeans or a narrow skirt. the only thing i'm not crazy about is the rayon fabric, though it is a substantial weight and machine washable.
11952	This top was a great purchase even though it's a bit expensive. love the colors and the fit.
11953	This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.
11954	I found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline; however, the fabric feels cheap and doesn't drape as nicely as i'd hope for the price. this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric. for sizing reference, i'm 5'5'', 122 lbs, 30dd, and took my usual size xs - though i'm busty for my size, the top provides nice coverage.
11955	The shape is awkward, too loose, not flattering. my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasn't as cute as online. returning this one.
11956	I have many maeve shirts and this one does not disappoint. i purchased the blue and love it. i do agree with other reviews though that the chest is a little tight while the rest of the fit is small.
11957	I love the way this dress fits and flares in all the right places making it one of the most flattering dresses i've tried in a while. for me, maeve dresses tend to run a bit big, so i sized down to a small (i'm typically an 8-10). the colors are a little deeper/richer in person, which made me very happy. i love the flounce in the skirt - it adds more swing to the dress. the only draw back was the v-neck came down a bit low. easy fix with a cami for work.
11958	I love this cut of shirt. the stripes are fun. i did have to go up a size due to my bust (34dd), which made the lower part a little bit more flow-y. regardless, i still love this top. so much that i have bought 3 of the prints available.
11959	"Contrary to what previous reviewers have said, i think this top fits really well, and is very flattering. i also don't find it too long at all. i normally wear a size small, and got this in a size 4. no gapping at the chest, and i'm a 34d. (5'4"", 124 lbs, 36-27-35). and the colors in the striped version are really pretty. i plan to wear it now and right through spring. i did have a quality issue, however. the first one i received had bunched up stitching where the pleats begin right below the po"
11960	This is a really cute shirt for spring. i love the colored striping and you can dress it up or down. have not worn it yet -- waiting for it to get a little warmer.
11961	I'm a huge maeve enthusiast. tried this on in three different colors, and although these types of maeve tops have had sizing differences from season to season, this top is more true-to-size than others have been more recently. the petite size for me was too short to tuck in, but the regular worked perfectly. the top is roomy, flowy, and the white version is sheer, but a white tank under it would be perfect. the green umbrellas are adorable! a great way to spruce up your wardrobe for spring!
11962	I love this shirt! it is so feminine and comfortable! will be on repeat!
11963	I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person, the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they'd fall off. i also didn't like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn't justify the cost with the quality.
11964	This dress has a very flattering cut for hourglass ladies. i am an 8/10 and got the medium. the sleeves are a little blousy, otherwise it is just about perfect. it will look great with boots or booties for fall. i will wear a thin tank with it to work because the neckline is a little deep.
11965	"This top is beautiful! it is comfortable - soft and relaxed without being ""baggy."" colors are just as seen on the website...if not prettier. it is a versatile and flattering top; tucked in or not; sleeves rolled up or not; i love it!"
11966	The details on this blouse - lace inset in front and sheer back - look just as great in person as they do in the photos. the fabric is wonderful too; the knit has enough heft that it doesn't show every body imperfection or detail in your bra. it held up well through its first wash and ironing as well. as others have noted, the style is versatile - easy to wear with a cardigan or blazer at work or to pair with skinny jeans or shorts on the weekend. i was also positively impressed by the color sin
11967	Love the colors! love the stripes! great shape! great style! but...i am normally a 12 on top...and this pulled across my back...so i have it in for an exchange for a 14. sometimes i have to do that...i have a broad back. we will see how it fits! but what an adorable shirt!
11968	I adore this top. the fit is amazing. the colors are vibrant and will transition beautifully into spring. i think it looks great with skinny jeans. i am built small up top size m and the 6 fit perfectly. the buttons did not gape at all.
11969	I grabbed this during a 20% off sale so i will state first that i don't think this top is worth full price, and even at 20% off i wasn't wowed enough to pay that much for it. the colors are more saturated in person and very pretty. however, the cut- both the length and the width- just made it too overwhelming on my size 14/16 frame. i ordered the xl and it was wayyyy too big through the chest but sizing down to a large meant that it didn't flow over my hips as well because it's so long. i think
11970	I got this in the dark coral color. it is lovely. i'm taking it to hawaii!
11971	Love this top, flattering on my post baby body. its feminine and soft
11972	"Sizing: i'm have broad shoulders/back, 36c (34d), short waist, and i usually wear a m in a knit top. that's what i bought, so i'd say that this tee is tts. it is a little longer in the back than front, but not as a high/low top would be. rather, it's sort of tunic-like in style. i have worn it over leggings with and without a sweater, and the added length covers me. i admit that i'm a tad on the short side at 5'2"", and that i have no hips (straight up and down) and no waist. my shape is an upsid"
11973	
11974	"So flattering! the length is perfect and hits just above the knee in front (slightly longer on sides).  i was looking for a versatile dress that could be worn to church, work, luncheons, or casual evening events.  this one fits the bill. i love that it pays homage to the boho/peasant trend without being shapeless or making me look too wide. i am 5'6"" (long torso) 132 lbs, 32d and the small fit perfectly. i got the black motif print."
11975	The blazer is boxy and less dressy that it seemed online. i could only really wear this in casual situations, and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work as well. it does have an interesting hemline. the shoulders are a bit too narrow for me (but i do have shoulders on the broader side). i don't hate it, but i don't love it either, but it is interesting enough that i'm going to keep it. i ordered a small.
11976	"This is a great blouse. the fabric is a fine rayon which is soft and has a lovely drape to it. i have found rayon to be a good fabric all year and quite cool in the summer. i am 5'7"" long waisted and 127 lbs with a slender build so i usually wear a size 6--this fits perfectly as well as being quite flattering. it can be worn loose or belted with a contrasting or black belt over skinny jeans. it would also be swell with a pencil skirt. it will cover any fashion flaws! i usually like to shop the s"
11977	Love this blouse. it fits well with a slight flare at the bottom. doesn't wrinkle much and washes in cold water perfectly. have had compliments on the style and design. a definite buy!
11978	These are the perfect way to battle the california heat in style- more beautiful than on the picture. you can't see, but there are gold threads running through the fabric. pair with a sandal and a flow top, and i'm good to go!
11979	These are the cutest prints, but the cute simply doesn't work for me. this is longer than the conversationalist shirt, which is an improvement as far as i'm concerned. nevertheless, both my appropriate size, which i still felt was too short, and the size up, which hit at a flattering spot, were twice as wide as as my midsection. so while the arms and shoulders seem true to size, the shirt runs very wide.
11980	"Love this top! kept looking online, but really wanted to try on. so once i made it to a store, i was so happy they had my size! i'm 5'1"", but prefer regular sizes in retailer for the length. i got the xs and it is a lovely fit, tts. love the colors in the pink top!"
11981	
11982	I am a 10 m and got the 10. it fits perfectly and there is room in the bust (i'm 36/38 c). the shirt feels very nice and silky up to the skin. i'm just not sure about the print- i got the umbrellas. it's cute, but maybe a little too cartoonish? it does look good with a green or blue puffy vest for colder days...still trying to decide if i should keep or return, but only b/c of the print. i'd love this in some solid colors!
11983	I ordered this top on sale and so glad that i did. i am usually a small in tops, but had read that it runs small. i went with a medium and wish that i picked the small. it is definitely a swing top. it's best feature is the detailing; it's gorgeous. i paired it with jeans and a white denim jacket.
11984	Love these pants! the are super comfy and very flattering, but they are very long. i did manage to have them altered,but you may risk losing the flare, which is unfortunate considering the price.
11985	I am somewhere between a size 6 or 8, so i ordered this dress in a size small. mistake. too small. the color of this dress is so lovely. it's between red and orange. will probably order it in medium.
11986	I really love this dress because it can be dressed up with wedges or heels for a wedding or cocktail party, but could also be dressed down with a cute pair of gladiators. i love the pockets too! i'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone who needs a go-to summer dress for many occasions.
11987	I was looking for a romper for a long time which i don't need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax. because of its design with a line on the top, no worries for a relaxed romper. the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight.
11988	I can't believe these aren't sold out yet.  i had no problem getting this over my head.  this top has such beautiful colors and embroidery.  quality is good.  flattering on.  at this price, it is probably the best deal i've gotten on anything from retailer.  i would recommend this top, absolutely!
11989	"Love, love, love but alas had to return. gorgeous fabric and elegant design, i purchased for an evening summer wedding. however, the cut of this dress is more suited to a small bust line and a short waist. i felt like it hit at my rib cage and not my natural waist and my top half was spilling out of the neckline. it was slightly loose so i don't think sizing up would have helped. maybe i needed to size down? i'm 5'6"", 145 lbs and had the 10. loved but it didn't fit me properly. also noticed the"
11990	This sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings. sundry's lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool. the fit is true to size. the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice. i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along!
11991	"I really liked the style of this dress. the top was nice and stretchy and the bottom is so soft and silky. i love lace and thought that was a nice detail for the top. the colors are a little brighter in person, the red in the pictures here is more of a hot pink in person. i'm planning on buying some hot pink flats to wear with it at a wedding this summer!   one reviewer said she didn't like the placement where the dress fell, i have a short torso and long legs, so i like to try to emphasize a"
11992	...and another addition to my wedding guest wardrobe! the skirt print is gorgeous and i can't wait to shop for the perfect shoe and accessories. i'm very hippy with a thinner waist and this hides that. i love the pockets and the fact that i can wear a regular, comfortable bra. all-around a great purchase!
11993	I was going to order a size 2 online but decided to check my local store first (hate paying for shipping - especially when so many retailers offer free shipping regardless of the purchase amount). all that was left was a 0 and 10. i decided to go ahead and try the 0 just for size comparison. i'm usually a size 2 but this dress fit perfect in the 0. a 2 probably would have been ok but may have been a bit looser in the top. i love the lace fabric on the top and the contrast it provides to the skir
11994	"This is a very beautiful and well-made skirt. it looks a little like ribbon material. it is very think and lush, and the pockets add a little extra special to it. the waist band is very sturdy and it wears very flattering. even putting my hands in the pockets feels very thick and silky. i am 5'1"" with a 27in waist and the size 2 fit really well, just above the knee."
11995	
11996	"I tried on the xs in store in crimson (i would need petite) - the color and fit were very flattering on me (pale skin). the dress feels very silky, i love the back, how it ties, and how high the neckline was on me in the front. the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch. my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee... i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go, just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work...   reference: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist."
11997	This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person, and as soon as i got it out of the bag, one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well, but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for.
11998	"I am normally a size medium or small at retailer (depending on the bust) and could not even get the medium in this top past my neck. it runs very small. unfortunately the size large was not in stock for me to try. truthfully, i might have needed the xl in this - it runs that small. for reference, i am 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd. also, the beading on the top i tried was coming loose and some was already missing. seems to be a common fault based on what other reviewers have said."
11999	
12000	The quality and aesthetic of this dress is wonderful. the fit and look are classic. i am 5'10'' and the dress falls mid thigh. this is a beautiful dress for a special event, simple but with sparkle at the neckline and an unusual print. i am very happy with this purchase.
12001	
12002	"Ordered this top the second i saw it! i wear a small or med. depending on the cut and fabric............noticed it is cotton and went with a medium. so happy i went with the larger size.......runs very small, especially in the chest, and there is no give in the fabric. stunning top but would go up one, possibly two sizes."
12003	I love this dress! its feminine, sassy and very comfortable. it fit my body type well--i'd say i have more of an athletic build (broad shoulders, 36c, straight in waist/hips) plus i have a lovely left over tummy from two babies.... the top has stretch and is a higher waist which is slimming on my body. the bottom material is a thick and high quality with a design that is beautiful in person. it sits out from my waist and hips and easily covers the left over tummy and is super easy to move in. po
12004	They were way way too small! i bought a 32 and they would probably fit someone that usually wears a 28. i was so sad to send them back because i loved them.
12005	I love these jeans and want to keep them but they are so long! im 5'7 and they wrap all the way under my feet so i cant even have them altered because it would cut the flare out. its kind of crazy how long they are.
12006	Adorable, comfortable piece. runs slightly big.
12007	For reference i am 5'3 and 120-123lbs. i wear a size 6-8. the quality of material on this skirt is very good and quite heavy. the waistband has a little stretch and the skirt is lined. there are pockets. longer on me than the model which is fine because i'm wearing it to work. this skirt has no black ( it's dark navy and brown) in it and will not look good with black tights which how i wear skirts to work. can be worn with no tights it's a made of substantial curtain like material. i'm keeping i
12008	Wore this dress for my bridal shower and got a ton of compliments! it fits great and is very well made!
12009	Very soft and luxe materials and really well made. pockets a nice detail and otherwise a great cut and length. petticoat underneath a cool detail too.
12010	Fits nicely - i'm a standard size 4 most places. also perfect for those in-between occasions. can be dressed up or down and worn with flats or heels :)
12011	"I don't understand the low rating. the head opening in my size (2) is perfect and i don't have a small head.  the style is both flattering on many shapes and very comfortable. the embroidery is gorgeous and the blue hue can be paired with many colors. it be worn with jeans on the weekend and also dresses up beautifully for the office if worn with a jacket and a pair of slacks. i wore it with an olive jacket and jeans last week and received compliments!  the caveat is that it wrinkles.. a lot."
12012	Fabric was a little more shear than i thought it would be - while not a big deal - it was missing a few of the silver beads along the front line of the top. returned
12013	
12014	"When i saw this dress i knew i had to have it! i loved the colors and design. i am a wedding planner and dresses with pockets are my ""uniform"" i was a little concerned after reading some of the other reviews, but i ordered anyway and am glad i did! it fits perfect and looks just like the photo."
12015	I too, was dubious about the dry clean only label but purchased it anyway because it was really cute and comfortable.  the shorts part is lined which is nice.  not see through.  the waist is a smocking with elastic.  it's also very thin thread.  the first one i tried on had a couple of stitches ripped in this waistband and because of that the fabric sort of bubbled out.  i bought a different one knowing it was delicate.  this isn't a romper your going to want to shimmy over your hips because of
12016	Great for hot weather, dress up and dress down! don't need to decide what to match with and bottom or top!
12017	This runs huge, not large, huge; and hung in quite a baggy way. bought a medium ( 5'10, 150 lbs) and i could have gotten an x-tra small. maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered, but now its just too much of a hassle
12018	This skirt is exactly as i had hoped it would be. the zipper works great, the material feels nice, and the liner is attached to the skirt so there is no bunching effect. after the first time i wore the skirt i went out and bought more tops to go with it. i highly recommend this skirt.
12019	The style and material are nice, but what i love is that it does not give me a wedgie! and i think it would still fold nicely on shorter frames.
12020	"I'm a little heavier than i'd like due to postpartum fluff and have to gradually lose because of breastfeeding, so i look for bottoms with enough give in the waist that will still fit once i reach my goal weight. for reference i'm about 33"" waist x 44"" hips with a goal of 31"" waist x 40"" hips, so roughly a size 12/14 getting back to an 8/10. i bought a medium and it stretches enough to fit. this skirt is a solid staple and the colors are just lovely. the flat elastic in the waistband doesn't rol"
12021	Saw this skirt in the sale room and figured i'd give it a try. i'm always looking for comfortable skirts that aren't too tight around the waist. once i zipped it up, i knew it would be a keeper! the waist band is super comfortable and it has a hook/eye closure as well. the material is a little heavier weight, but that's fine it can work for winter as well. it's soft, yet structured. the pockets are always a plus. if you want to step away from the normal shapes and colors, this is out of the box
12022	"I paired this gorgeous top with a black v-neck cardigan, mother lookers and black booties and felt and looked so totally feminine and amazing...i honestly lost count of the compliments that i received!!  beading is sewn on tightly, and the stitching on the embroidery has no loose ends.  i am 5'3""/108 and took the regular size small.  highly recommend!!"
12023	Super comfy, easy to put on, and super cute! you can dress it up and dress it down! i'm usually a size s and the small fits fine, but i think the xs would have fit better.
12024	Love this skirt! very fun and feminine. it is a great fit and i love the layering contrast of stripes. length goes right to below my knees, which is perfect for me! i am petite and curvy.
12025	"In the photo of the dress, you might have a hard time telling that the top half of the dress is the ""lace"" part, and is a stretchy knit fabric, while the bottom half is polyester and not stretchy at all. fyi: 36c (34d), short waist, broad shoulders/back, usually a 10/12 in a fitted top/dress the navy lace of the top, as i said, is knit. therefore it was too stretchy, and the straps actually were already too long. it was so loose, that i needed the smaller size in the top half of the dress (10)."
12026	
12027	"I am 5'2"" and got this in a 6p. i would say it fits tts (the top also has some give), but the waist is just a few inches away from being empire. i think the dress on the model is pulled down to de-emphasize this. even so, it is a very cute dress - plan to wear it with a navy velvet jacket for easter."
12028	Great material. quality and versatility is there. it is easy to get in and out of which is hard to find and the fit is adjustable at the waist.
12029	This top is not for a curvy figure. the embroidered part is gorgeous, very stunning, but the loose bottom part is awful. i am curvy and usually wear l or xl. this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom, made me feel like i had a big tummy, and was a tad short. i am sending this back. this would look better on a more slender frame.
12030	I can't say enough good things about this romper. i am curvey on the bottom and have never been able to get on board with the romper trend because all the ones i had tried were too short or were clearly made for models and teenagers. this romper is a great length and style for all ages and body types. the material is so soft and is the kind of material that won't easily wrinkle. it can easily be dressed up for a night out with wedges and jewelry or dressed down for day with  flats (and maybe eve
12031	Yes,you need these, so comfortable - and wash up perfectly - workout, walking or great to sleep in
12032	I was so sure i was going to love this dress when i saw it on the rack. i was so disappointed by how poofy on the bottom. it was not flattering at all! i'd love to see this pattern back with a better fit.
12033	Great summer shirt. loose fitting, but especially wide. the button gather in back is a nice detail
12034	I would of paid double the amount for this romper. i am a medium and the medium fits perfect. i am a little long in the torso, so some rompers aren't comfortable but this one is! this is going to be a summer staple for sure.
12035	
12036	I don't know why this piece is so wide around the body. the fabric is very good. just the design is way boxy. i get xsp, still boxy.
12037	Cute top for jeans or capri pants. love the sleeve length.
12038	Perfect for end of summer going into fall. very soft and pairs great with skinnies and sandals or booties. still trying to find a sweater to layer it with. runs true to size. i am an xs/0 and got the xs. i was a little worried because i am so petite i usually swim in tops like this. it fits perfectly and comfortably.
12039	I'm 32b-26-36, straight and slim, and the 0 fits like a glove. it's a nice change from all these loose, billowy (sometimes sack or tent like) dresses. if you are busty or have a broad rib cage, you'll need to size up for sure. the slip is fitted and im wondering if it will stay put. love all the colors in this dress - navy was better for me, the white washed me out and was just underwhelming. the band of lace hits high on my waist at a spot that is flattering and slimming which doesn't happen of
12040	"Finally a jumper that works for me! i am 5'6 but i have a long torso so most jumpers ride up in an uncomfortable way. this one is perfect. the material is light and perfect for warm weather. the top is very adjustable for all different chest sizes. i personally think the pant length looks better if you are under 5'8"" because it comes down closer to the ankle but then again if you have long thin legs you might not mind the bottom hitting at your calf. i can't say enough good things about this jum"
12041	This is a very cute dress, with a comfortable fit. my only gripe is that i could not get the top of the v-neck slip to stop shifting to the side.
12042	"I tried on xs regular and xxs petite, i would need xs petite (115 lbs, 30dd chest, 5'1.5"").  love the cut, very cute and flattering, the tie back is styling... but this piece is very trendy, and so i decided to pass as i am not sure how often i could wear it to work. will wait to see if it goes on sale. patter is very fun, nice for the beach or casual brunch with the girls. i do still like it."
12043	I can't believe this top hasn't sold out. it is a great casual top that will go well with anything. i agree with previous reviewer that talked about sizing up to cover straps. i did size up to a large but it didn't get huge around the midsection. i got the red and it will go great with pilcro khakis or denim.
12044	This top was so pretty online! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person, though the back was gorgeous, with a button gather at center. the color appeared yellow online, but was a bit more green in person. also, the armholes were very low, so it would need a camisole or no bra.
12045	I love this dress! it is an easy throw on and go dress. the fabric is very soft and the cut is faltering. fit is true to size.
12046	I bought this dress for my sister's bridal shower, and it was a hit! i was a little bit surprised when it arrived because i did think it was going to be actual tweed - it is not. it is simply a tweed pattern! i think it makes a little bit more casual, but it was a fun dress for an afternoon bridal brunch! one thing i wish it had - pockets!!
12047	"Not sure why this says ""online exclusive"" as i bought it in green in the store. i also saw it in a mustard color at another location. but in any case, this is an adorable and flattering dress. fabric is kind of a chino. weighty but not too heavy. great color and design. runs a bit small. my normal size was snug and i thought that in the summer heat i would not want it that clingy so went up a size. i love it and would buy it in more colors!"
12048	"This is a great dress! it's cut nicely, is flattering, and it's not too short. if i put it on, i look put together in a matter of seconds. the dress fits true to size. one thing, i would agree with the other review that this is not really ""tweed."" instead it is made out of a patterned stretchy material that is a little thinner than tweed. the colors are really beautiful, and while the blues and reds are more intense in real life, it looks terrific."
12049	
12050	I found this to be a very feminine and flattering dress. it is prettier in person. i have the ivory and black print. i agree that it takes a bit of effort to get the slip positioned properly. i might wear a different slip, however i was able to get the slip to stay in place. the print and fabric are a nice quality. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p. i bought this in the 0 regular because i like my dresses a little bit longer. i think it runs just a little bit small.
12051	"Got this in the ""dark blue"" wash; there is significantly less color variation than pictured online; it's a medium wash, and incredibly soft. i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps: if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes, go with your larger size. this feels incredibly silky. it's lightweight, so it can be worn (almost) year-round and will layer well over say, a tissue-style turtleneck in the winter. it's longer in the b"
12052	Perfect for when you're a guest at someone's home , having guests or just lounging !  prettiest set you'll ever own... you'll feel as if your on vacation even if you're not. i wouldn't travel without this set !! highly recommend. love.
12053	Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
12054	This was my first time ordering or even knowing about retailers. what a pleasant surprise. i will shop often!
12055	This is a really great top. it is really soft and made very well. it could be a casual top with jeans, or, dress up with some chunky jewelry and cute heels. i wasn't sure which size to get because i mostly get mediums amd i sometimes get a large. i ended up going with a large and it seemed to be just a little too big, but it doesn't have that look at all. it looks so much better in person than on the computer. overall a very cute top!
12056	These are such under-rated pants! i love the fit, style, fabric & everything about them. they are the perfect weight & can be worn with boots, sandals, flats, etc. they run tts - i got my usual 26. get yourself a pair while they last. you won't regret it.
12057	The design and workmanship of this dress are outstanding. the fit may be tricky for some. i am small busted and the bust and even the neckline are very tight and fitted. still flattering, though. i typically wear a 0 or 2 in dresses and purchased this in a 2. i could have worn a 4. 5'8 127lbs. the length is perfect as i purchased this in navy for a wedding. the navy cami slip underneath is top quality with adjustable straps and snaps to hold them in place at your shoulder. overall a sweet and dr
12058	"I've had a hard time finding the right jumpsuit and haven't ha a lot of luck with retailer clothing lately, but this is perhaps my favorite retailer purchase of all time. i'm petite and busty (5'2"", 34c/d) and was pleasantly supposed at how well this fits. the pattern is a bit faded (like the best kind of vintage find) so it works for someone short like me. and because the back has a tie closure, it can adjust as needed -- i'll be wearing it with a sports bra that crosses in back with 4 straps, whic"
12059	I don't have anything but raves here.  this is a perfectly proportioned jumpsuit of high quality fabric in a neutral color (which is like a denim looking blue color with a beige starburst pattern, much, much nicer in person than in the product photo and has a really neat slightly nubby texture that adds interest).  it's easy to get in and out of.  the back of the waistband is elastic and stretches, so the only thing you have to do is tie the back, which is really easy.  the top (as someone menti
12060	This is one of the most flattering tops i've ever owned. i'm a little confused by the other reviews, because the model in the photo doesn't have it tacked in the back. you can see on the photo of the back, there's a button to pull it in which makes it so incredibly flattering. it's soft and beautiful, but very delicate. i'd wash it separately and carefully, and rarely :) i actually had to return my first one because of a hole in the material. overall, one of my new favorite tops.
12061	This is a very cute top. my only reservation is that where the elastic is on the side sticks out a little more than i would like. it's not that big of a deal though.
12062	I love  this dress. it is beautiful , feminine, and fits perfectly. i am a 4 in a dress size. i have long wait 5,7. . very happy in this simple yet unique dress.
12063	The dress didn't meet my expectations, specifically the color, the texture, and the cut of the dress. although the dress was very well made, it just wasn't right for me.
12064	This is my favorite jumpsuit purchase of the season. flattering, casual look. well made light material. easy to dress up or down. can't wait to wear it again!
12065	Agree with other reviewers that the dress doesn't look like the picture so retailerpligie should really change it out. however i'm keeping the dress since it does look cute on. definitely more yellow in it than you can see.
12066	I usually don't do jumpsuits because i'm 6 ft tall and the torso is usually too short. i saw this one in a store though and decided to try it on. it's very light and soft cotton and fit great lengthwise! overall, the fit is way too large though. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and i was swimming in the xl - as in the waistband was at least 4 inches too big. the back of the waistband has elastic so if you aren't sure what size to get, size down. i got a size l and it's still a bit too big - the back
12067	Retailer is totally killing my wallet because i can't resist these modern-city-meets-prairie-boho dresses. i bow down to the textile designers who created this print, it's stunning. as for reality vs. model shoot, it's pretty much what you see--the colors are spot on, the outer dress is sheer, the bodice is slightly fitted, with a fuller skirt that doesn't poof too much. all poly construction with no stretch whatsoever. i had a bit of a struggle getting the outer dress over my shoulders but once a
12068	I like the soft green color, the chino fabric and the casual vibe this dress exudes. perfect for spring and early summer. runs tts but may be snug for bustier gals. wish this had pockets.
12069	
12070	I have an upside-down triangle shape. i am a 4/6 on the bottom and a 10/12 on top. i have a short waist. i have very slim hips and virtually no waist. so, a typical jumpsuit or romper really doesn't fit me. this one is the exception! likely because it ties in the back, but the s fit me perfectly. the bottom half is easy, but not oversized. the top half of the jumpsuit is adjustable, so there is no issue with size. i am 36c on top, but i think that i could pull off the top, without a bra. you can
12071	
12072	Sleeves were a bit too long and the size was too big but it's really cute and if they had a smaller size i would definitely have exchanged!
12073	Wanted a jumpsuit that didn't look stupid on a 50+ year old -- this is it! ordered a large and it is a little loose around the waist, but still fits and is comfortable. extremely well made and very cute. the only complaint is that it is difficult to tie the back.
12074	I usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly. this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didn't. i'm 5'4 and i ordered a petite small. i was swimming in it. the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants. i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me.
12075	I fell in love with this dress the second i saw it in store. i haven't experienced any of the issues others have. i love the short, flowy, feminine look and i think it can be dressed up or down. it would be great for a summer wedding or cocktail event, or dressed down as a day dress with a jean jacket. i've received compliments every time i've worn it.
12076	I love wearing this. it is a little slice of summer, which i am desperately hanging on to. the color pops, it's so very comfortable, & the back is a work of art! can be dressed up with a pencil summer skirt, or down with capri style pants.
12077	I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed, not the same colors as the picture, spandex material, the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.
12078	I bought this for myself and my mom and we both love it! i got it in a small and almost wish i had gotten it in an xsmall. it's super comfy and appropriate for work.
12079	These pajama pants are beautiful but very sheer and very delicate.  not ideal for a mom with kids
12080	The sweater is a great fit and the styling is very original and wonderful. it will be great with leggings, jeans, or even a straight skirt. i would definitely recommend this sweater.
12081	These leggings are loose fitting and the quality is just not there.. i am returning the item.
12082	Thee are beautiful pants. so soft to the touch. true to color. ca.t wait to wear them in the fall.
12083	"For a special occasion, but i didn't keep mine:  i ordered petite and it was short on me, too short for my comfort  color is nice, rsty burgundy, i expected it a little more 'red"" fastening is a little more complicated, though you don't have to make it complicated, it has hooks at each end of the hole in the back,.  but: it is a nice cut, flattering to the silhouette, i might order a regualr size if i needed it. the body is structured, mateiral is not stiff, but also not soft. the arms is"
12084	"I love the cut of these pants! i'm very curvy and the high waist and wide leg is perfect for me. these hang off the hips beautifully. i'm 5'2"" and the petite is perfect with heels. i didn't have to hem them. the one drawback is that they get very static clingy which is frustrating. i wear them with a cream tie blouse and wedges. they're really comfortable."
12085	This dress is beautiful. the fabric is light weight but textured and interesting, and the purple is gorgeous. the soft pink was a bit more orange than i expected, but not a deal breaker. the problem i had with the dress was fit around the arms. i sized up and was glad that i did because it runs small up top, but because the straps come in a bit around the arm holes, it creates armpit fat, which is not a problem i usually have. i could wear the dress with a sweater, but you wouldn't be able to se
12086	"For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips) i bought my usual size 4 and it fit perfectly. like other reviewers said, this is a very fine corduroy fabric. the thicker fabric really helps smooth any bumps and bulges, and the a-line skirt was flattering. overall i liked this dress, but the color didn't do much for me. because it just wasn't ""wow"" on me, i found little things to nitpick. the bodice is very flattering, but the way it cuts in shows bra-straps ("
12087	"I initially bought the red and blue sweater in a medium. i usually wear a large and the medium fits perfectly and is still a bit baggy. i'm tall (5'9"") and so i love the length of the sleeves when they are unrolled. it's a very versatile piece. with sleeves rolled down you can fold the collar so the red is out of sight and just have a navy blue sweater. either look is nice. i loved it so much i bought the black and brown version. also, the fabric doesn't feel thick but it is very insulating and"
12088	I absolutely love this shawl/jacket! i usually use it as outerwear and it is the perfect piece for those in between weather days in new england when it's too cold for winter wear and not warm enough to go without a jacket. the black/brown works great with whatever you're wearing. so versatile and i love that it has pockets!
12089	This robe is so pretty, i kind of feel like a movie star when i wear it! the embroidered flowers and trim are a very nice touch. the fabric is very light and soft, i'm sure it will feel nice and cool on those hot summer nights ahead. the fit is true to size and is actually a bit longer than what is shown on the model. i am extremely happy i decided to make this purchase.
12090	"I usually wear stevie's in ag, but when i saw the prima was on sale i decided to give it a try and i""m so glad i did! they came today and i tried them on, i will say the rise feels a little higher than mid-rise, but it's so soft and stretchy i didn't really care. they're definitely skinny but with so much stretch they feel like a comfortable legging that doesn't fit quite so tightly. the color/wash is great too. for this price, these are awesome. i ordered a 29, same as my stevies and it fit per"
12091	"I ordered this dress for a special event and i am so incredibly happy with it! i am 5'1"", 97 lbs, 32b and ordered a 0 petite. fits like a glove. the dress has a slight give to it, but main dress fabric is a thick material so order your usual size. fits close through the waist and flares out below. the length hit above the knee so not too short, although i wouldn't want it any shorter. my main worry was whether my bra would show in the back, but i had no issue. overall, the dress is stunning with"
12092	"Buy this robe before its gone! my friend and i each bought this robe... it feels amazing and makes a girl feel pretty!. i bought the xs/s (34c, 26"" waist), but i tried on the m/l and could have made that work too. love!"
12093	The pattern is cute and vibrant, and the shillouette is simple, but the courderoy felt too heavy and stiff and it was too small around the chest for me (36dd).
12094	Cute enough, but i couldn't figure out what to do with the tie that didn't make it look like an extra set of sleeves, oddly placed.
12095	"I love these pants! for reference i am 5'1 1/2"" and 104lbs. so definitely petite. i ordered the extra small petite- way too long and huge around the hips.- i checked to see if maybe they sent the wrong size. hemming would not have been a problem and i even considered having them altered - but it would have been too difficult with the pockets and the pleats. unfortunately they do not come in xxs p so sadly they are going back. order a size down."
12096	I've been looking for a nice affordable robe for awhile and this is the one! it's so soft and the design makes you feel fancy when you wear it. perfect for lounging doing my nails or wearing a face mask.
12097	This dress is well made and of good quality it just looked a little too old on me. the skirt was heavy and the fabric was cozy, perfect for a fall outfit.
12098	Love this sweater/jacket. fit is good and the colors are just right, not to bright and not boring. the shawl color takes a wee bit of adjusting but is worth the extra minute or so. also has a hood built into shawl that when not in use can not be seen, very cool. have worn it a couple of times and always get compliments.
12099	This dress is a keeper. fits true to size, comfortable and love the pockets. it can be a casual day dress or add some jewelry for a night time dinner out. i was concerned with the fabric being a velvet material but is very light and comfortable
12100	"This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering, but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all, it's just a very good design.  note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear, without being visible, into the sleeve when they are not being used. also, the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used, so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo)."
12101	
12102	Really striking. even prettier in person. color is beautiful. told my husband this is a half-way-to-christmas present!
12103	I love ag jeans. these jeans fit snug but not confining. they have some stretch to the material so that you can move with ease. i love the way they fit my body with one exception. unfortunately they did not have the petite available so the length is about 3 to 4 inches too long on my 5'3 frame. the dark blue makes it acceptable for casual friday (yay). i am 5'3 102lbs and even though i will have to hem them, the overall fit was great!
12104	"I tried this in a size medium. i have purchased several rompers this summer and that's usually the size that fits (i'm 5'4"" and hover around 130lbs). i'm short waisted. i don't have a long torso but this just fit. if you look at the model in the pic, she's bent to one side giving the look of blousing at the top, but if you stand upright, it's very straight and smooth. i could get it to blouse over the waist but then i had to pull the bottom up so high the shorts became way to short. i like the m"
12105	It's impossible to tell, but this dress is made from very fine wale corduroy. the neckline is very flattering for a smaller chested woman, with a sharp cut (that makes a strapless bra required for peace of mind). the dress does have snaps to hold your bra straps in, but i went ahead with a strapless. the back has a neat square cut. the skirt is slightly longer, on both sides, which gives the dress movement, even though the material is heavier than typically used for this season or cut. i wore it
12106	I wanted to love this. the color in the picture is pretty true-to-life. the top fit well, if a bit smaller than usual, but the skirt piece was way too flared for my petite (5') frame. it was too voluminous compared to the top of the dress. the material is very soft, but thin, and is lined, which was a pleasant surprise. sadly, a return for me.
12107	This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me.
12108	Love it! easy to wear, true to size. there is a slight texture which makes it very cozy
12109	I returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo. i did not like the color.
12110	I purchased this top in the navy. the picture makes the top look like an interesting blue with some purple in it, but in person the top is just... navy. the lace and fabric are soft. it fits true to size; i almost always wear a small and the small fit fine. it wasn't quite my style, but it's a pretty top that will be great for spring and summer.
12111	I bought this in the sable green. you can wear this blouse tucked in, or out if you're wearing something lie leggings. it is comfortable and the color is very flattering.
12112	Beautiful lace detail and very soft material. runs a little big.
12113	Unfortunately, this sweater let me down! i love retailer, especially their sweaters, but this one fell flat. it was tight on the arms, and didn't hang well on my body. it was odd in length and added about 20lb to my frame. i kept it because i wanted to force it to work, alas, i just donated it. hopefully it fits someone else better than me..
12114	Tried on the xxs petite and still felt that it looked too boxy and baggy on me. cute concept but poor execution
12115	This top was originally way overpriced. so i ordered it on sale for half price. still overpriced. it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed. the quality is not great. it is like a jersey type material. doesn't look like the photograph at all. i like the color, but frankly, that's about it.
12116	I am keeping this because i got a great deal (30% off sale price), it fits great (i alternate between xs and s, went with s), and overall it has nice quality (thick fabric, secure toggles, etc.), but--what is with the lack of lining? i would hesitate to buy anything from this brand at full price because of that. there are just large seams on the inside, which is tolerable because of the type of fabric, but come on.
12117	I received my coat today. in love! it is so flattering in so many ways. it may not be form fitting, but i love all the details and i'm a sucker for hoods. this is a great fall/winter coat especially if you live in the south. it will probably only work as a late spring/early fall coat for you northern ladies. my only compliant is that the arms are too long, but i'm only 5', so it'll possibly be the perfect fit for someone else.
12118	"This is a great ""go to"" top. it isn't too low, too tight, too dressy or too casual. i'm 5'1 and ordered a small petite. it fits perfectly, especially under the arms, (where tops always show my bra) & it doesn't go ""too"" low. i have to admit, i purchased the dusty rose color, i'm not sure how great it complements my olive skin, but i love it anyway."
12119	Ordered this online in the pinkish color. the material is a little thin. as a busty, curvy lady this one just didn't sit right, ran a tad large, and looked boxy. if you have a thinner frame, may be a better look for you. detailing is nice.
12120	I ordered this for my friend and she loved it!
12121	I'm a bit disappointed in this top. i'm keeping because retailer's shipping rates are obnoxious and i don't have a store near me. by the time i pay for shipping both ways, i could have paid for 1/2 the shirt. the loft has some very similar tops for about 1/2 the price. i love meadow rue, and their material is fabulous, but the design is off on this one. you can't size down because the armholes and top are fitted, but the bottom is a tent. not my usual style, as i'm short, with a short waist. this
12122	I got this in white and was surprised to see that it fits me. i am very petite but with a 32d bust and purchased the xxs. this fit me perfectly! the fabric is soft and kind of silky, the straps were not too long, the hem hit just at my hip line. i am buying the other color!
12123	I just received this coat and love it. the only downside is that online the color looks like a royal blue (which i wanted) but in truth the coat is a basic navy. this was not a deal breaker for me. i love the details. it is not lined as someone mentioned earlier but it's not meant to be a heavy winter coat. i can't wait to wear it with jeans, boots and a striped or plaid tunic.
12124	I ordered this top online during the mother's day sale, thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer. i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back. the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good. but the problem is that the top comes with an under-layer up top. this is normally a good thing; extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless. the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee
12125	I love this dress even more in person than in the photo! it is more sleek and fitted than it appears on the model. the seams are flattering and the fabric is lovely.
12126	Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts, 36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however, i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn), 2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look, and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me, it wasn
12127	I fell in love with this online and i'm so thrilled that it's even more beautiful in person. it is a stunning, very dark teal velvet with the most gorgeous embroidery. perfect fit, quality, and nicely lined. a keeper for years to come! i think it's true to size (for reference i'm 5'1, 100 lbs and the 0p fits perfectly)
12128	I bought this vest hoping to be able to throw it over long sleeve tops for fall and it's perfect for that- it adds a bit of detail with the buttons and pockets on the vest!
12129	"Unbelievably soft fabric that doesn't feel like it will pill. i ordered dark grey. i'm 5'3"" 130 (just after baby) and size m fits well, super-flattering. doesn't smash my buns. the seams are in all the right places to flatter. styling is between ballerina and badass, as i think the ankle wraps look a little tough. i highly recommend."
12130	Hi, this top is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. very feminine. it has a small amount of swing without a large amount of fabric. love it.
12131	Love this top. looks much better on than the hanger. the color and fabric are very nice.
12132	I was hesitant to buy this top after reading previous reviews, but i love it! granted, i am two months postpartum so i am looking for tops that are airy (it's summer in socal) but cover up my tummy. the material is soft and stretchy and it does have a loose shelf bra type inset---so not a real bra but at least something there. i wore a free people bralette with it and it looked perfect! really happy with this top!
12133	I like the casual, yet detailed look of this piece. it looks great with crops. the casual tie string makes the piece feel very laid back, but the details are so pretty. i have it in lavender. it looks way better in person. saw it at the store and grabbed it immediately.
12134	"Absolutely in love with this dress! perfect to wear to work or for a casual brunch or cookout. i'm a 34b, 27"" waist, and 36"" hip and 5'3"" and went with the xsp. very impressed with the quality and well worth the sale price."
12135	This top works very well with a white or green cardigan for work. the color is more green than in the photo and it is wider on the bottom. it hides a non-flat stomach very well without looking matronly. i ordered a small petite, but i am heavy on top so i did not find the armhole problem that the other reviewer had. my only con is that i don't love the high-low thing that every retailer top seems to have these days, but i can live with it.
12136	"Great material that drapes nicely. super comfy, feels cool but it's a thick material--not at all see through. so happy i purchased this. and super easy with the snap buttons, but the shirt is very well made and high-quality material. would look great on all sizes and shapes. i'm 5' 4"" and about 140, small chest. normally i'm a s or m with tops but bought this in a m because i like a slightly oversized shirt, though it's also made to be looser and longer. still, at 5' 4"" i'm not swimming in a m."
12137	Pretty design and good quality but the medium was very balloony at the bottom. fit my chest alright (34c) but flared out way too much at the bottom.
12138	I am petite so ordered in the store and they shipped to my home. i ordered a 24p and they fit great. they stretch a tiny bit. goes with a lot of tops and they are light weight which is great with houston westher
12139	"This gorgeous dress is what retailer is all about. natural fibers like silk and rayon and cotton, unusual beautiful prints and colors, not your average day to day find. i bought this in my usual size l, and while i could use a bit more room in the top, it works either unbuttoned one button, which shows the beautiful turquoise slip that comes with it, or, i am going to stitch it down the front so the buttons won't open and the top won't gap at the bust. i am 5'5"" and the dress is a perfect l"
12140	I wanted to love this as i love bright colored patterns. however, when i received the pattern was different than the one pictured and didn't appear as bright and the material was much different than i expected. could almost see through the shirt where it is white and is very thin.  also, i have a larger chest and a smaller waistline and the cut of the where the peplum began made me look larger than i actually am. i am a 36ddd and i normally where a size medium. a medium fit but like i said made
12141	I bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit. the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size ... beware! i have a 36d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers. it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses. in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the 60's. it was a thick polyester type material. i think this shirt would still work f
12142	These are nice and light weight and comfortable
12143	"This top did not look at all like it did on the model. i thought it would be slightly loose through the hips but instead it was snug on top and very very very loose. great for someone who is pregnant. which i am not. returning."
12144	This top is cute! it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality. the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy. as another reviewer pointed out, the peplum is only in the front! it sounds really weird but i don't really mind the look because i'll be wearing a jacket over it. i'm usually a size 12/14 with a 36dd bust and the large fits beautifully.
12145	This is a very slimming, well-made, nice fitting top-i just disliked the colors. they did not look good on me. otherwise this is a very nice piece!
12146	"This is a great looking top but the sizing is way off. in the photo it looks a little oversized. i am normally a medium but this one was very small, sleeves several inches too short and it is more like 25"" long instead of the 35"" listed on the description. in the right size i think it will be great but i'm not sure whether to go up one size or two."
12147	"I love the peplum tanks that retailer puts out, but sadly this one did not work for me. the print is vibrant and the colors are even brighter in person, the the material made it look cheap. the fit in the bust was off - i felt that it cut too much into the bra area. and the poof part of the peplum hit me at a weird spot on my torso. really wanted it to work, but maybe it would look better on someone more slender/taller than me (for reference i'm 4'10"" and usually wear size l in retailer)"
12148	It's so hard to tell exactly what this sweatshirt looks like from the online photos. it has a white and pale sky blue tie dye look all over with a sea foam green floral print. runs tts. the floral print isn't centered on the one i received, but for $11 i'll be keeping it.
12149	When i got this top in the mail i was impressed by the colors. they were very vibrant and i loved the feel of the material as well. however the top did not look good on. i have an hourglass figure with a dd+ bust, and the peplum just made me look like i didn't have a waist. the arm holes were also very big and showed my bra. overall i think this is a very cute top, but would probably be better on women with more athletic figures.
12150	I'm 5'2 and bought the dress in a petite medium. i like to buy clothes that i can wear to work and this dress was almost too short. if it were any shorter, it wouldn't have worked. if i were to buy it again, i'd probably go with a non-petite size. also, i ordered the dress online and i found two snags in it as soon as i pulled it out of the box. i don't think they will be terribly noticeable, but just beware that this dress will apparently snag easily. i plan to wear it with a purse without meta
12151	I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight, sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big, so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first, but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2, 4, 6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details, but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's
12152	I picked this up on sale and was glad i did - the material is just the right thickness for some of the chilly days we have here in spring in the northeast. the fit is right on, but size up if you are unsure or inbetween. the detail down the back is adorable and adds a point of interest to this sweatshirt. the fit is boxy - but i think it compliments and balances the overall girly design.
12153	Great casual pant for the summer. wish there were more colors. white or beige would be great. comfortable. great fit. sizing is consistent with my normal designer denim sizing; 26. i'm also 5'3 and the regular size pant is just right for me.
12154	I was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package. the fabric is extremely stiff and thin. the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through. the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders, therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of children's clothing. i also ordered the matching pj pants but didn't even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater
12155	I bought this tank for work, but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo. i usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs, 5'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose, which i wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist, and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though, not to heavy and not too thin.
12156	I just received these in the mail, but had to send them back to the store because they are too big. i usually wear a 28 and sometimes even a 29 in most ag and mother jeans. the 28 in these were loose in the waist and overall baggier than shown in the picture. i ordered size 27, so hopefully these will fit just right since they are really cute. the beige color is just as pictured and almost a rust color which goes well with a dark grey top as shown.
12157	"This dress did not work well on my figure. i have a small waist and broad hips, and the dress (size m for 140 lbs, 5'8"") was too boxy. i didn't have objections to the fabric, like other reviewers - honestly, even if there were a snag or two, the fabric is kind of rustic and i don't think a snag would look terrible, depending on where it is. i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival. my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f"
12158	I love the colors of this top. it does run very large though. when i received my usual small i felt like i was swimming in the top, not fitted at all. the material is a bit funky too - seems a little lower quality because of the fabric. will return and try a smaller size if there is one available at the store and see if i change my mind.
12159	Wore this dress for easter dinner and received many compliments. it is delicate and if not careful the diamond pattern can snag. i loved the comfort and ability to dress up or down. i ordered the regular instead of petite as i wanted the length at my knees not thigh high. and it fit perfect at 5'4.
12160	This dress is beautiful and unusual. i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i bought...the turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also can't see in the picture, but they aren't gaudy or too stevie nicks-bohemian. i didn't find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer noted...it's' my normal size, and though i'm a little chesty (32-34
12161	I ordered this dress in two sizes, pxs and ps. they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival. there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance. unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price. also, the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the
12162	I liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt. pretty seam down the back and weight of material. i'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought.
12163	This dress hangs like a sack. it really needs a belt to give it some shape. i tried to style it with one, but then didn't look right either. i did like the slip that came with it. i'll be returning it.
12164	I thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt. not at all! i'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight. it is more fitted. if you are looking for something more comfy, don't buy. however, if you want more of a fitted blouse feel, then go for it.
12165	So wanted to love this top. love the look entirely. but the medium was beyond snug, so i sent it back for a large. hopefully the bigger size will make it a keeper!
12166	Material is thick and warm. print is very pretty. i received complements from all age groups. fits a little boxy but it works.
12167	Very nice material, soft and feminine colors. however, the waist sat higher than my natural waist and was uncomfortable. unfortunately it's going back
12168	This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape, but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..
12169	Ordered my regular size 27. they were tight when they arrived but they stretch - a lot. i like the looser style so was vey pleased but think they are at least a size larger after one wear.
12170	I really loved the colors and style of this top. unfortunately it runs a bit small and was too short on me. i'm 5'9. some mentioned they didn't like fabric but i thought it was good!
12171	I wanted to like this so much. it's a great good girl dress, church dress. however, it makes no sense. it's a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags i'm petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide.
12172	I was excited to try this on in the store today. the zipper details on the shoulder are really cute and the ribbing pattern is flattering. i was disappointed when i put it on though because it fits like a baby-doll / pregnancy top. it's snug around the bust, and then flares out pretty widely through the lower half. you can't really see that on the model. i was hoping it was more of a fitted tee, but sadly, that wasn't the case.
12173	This is one great button up shirt ! the fringe hem is a fun little detail that gives this shirt some serious versatility. it looks great layered under jackets and sweaters, with a came underneath, or all on its own. the fabric could be a bit thicker. i am between a small and a medium ( a 6 or an 8), and bought this in a small.
12174	Love this shirt! it is great quality and fits true to size in a comfy not too fitted way that a button down should fit. i love that it is a classic white cotton shirt with a modern edge with the little bit of fringing on the bottom and sleeve cuffs. it's great to wear with jeans or leggings and i can even see dressing it up or down depending on the accessories worn. i have already gotten lots of compliments when wearing it....everyone wants to get it for themselves! i'd even get it in another co
12175	"These are so comfortable and surprisingly flattering! i bought the taupe in sp, for reference i'm 5'2', 115 lbs., curvy on bottom. i was afraid it would give me a ""bubble butt"" and it didn't. could be dressed up with right shoes/accessories."
12176	I did the happy dance when the dress arrived, but the very sad dance when i tried it on. unfortunately, instead of following my instincts, i took the review here (and reviews from some other sites) to heart and ordered a size bigger than usual . huge mistake, as in this dress was huge -- much too big to alter and keep the integrity of design. for reference i'm 5'7, 130lbs, 34c. i usually wear an 8 dress (due to a very large rib cage). i ordered the 10 but was literally swimming. i think a 6 woul
12177	
12178	I was intrigued by this top...it's very cute but i feel that the tassels are just slightly too big and if the fringe would have been a little more subtle, the top would be cuter. i'm still on the fence with this one....
12179	"I ordered the ""red"" in a size xl. the fit is perfect--it matches the model's photos. the material is so soft. it's definitely a cozy fabric. the red color description is wrong but the photo accurately shows how it's really an orange shade. the color is cheery since it's bright. it will be great to use on cold days."
12180	I bought this dress for a christmas party and received lots of compliments! at 50, even though i live in a cold climate i was looking for something (not black!) stylish, and comfortable that i would not roast in at a party! it is a beautiful green color with nice embroidery front and back and the shape is very boho. i like my dresses a little more fitted so i bought the xs (and i am usually a small ...so size down!) and had the waist nipped in a bit by my seamstress to give it more of a flatteri
12181	I love this top! tassels are not too big. material is thick. i wish is was a little longer though.
12182	I really like this top, a nice spin on a class sweatshirt. fun with a pair of jeans or cords.
12183	Great everyday dress. i bought a small (5'9, 135lbs) and it really fits nicely.
12184	This is the cutest cardigan. i purchased it in the red. i wish there were more colors
12185	First tried on a large but wanted a little more room which an xl gave me. it is just what i wanted to update my wardrobe.
12186	Bought the camel color and love it. nice for cool evenings and mornings spring through fall. soft and comfortable. delicate yet not too much so that you wouldn't wear often.
12187	Great with leggings.perfect with cold weather. hard to find if you have large calves .retailer is only place i could find leg warmers to fit. they are nice and thick and warm. and true to color.
12188	I really love this dress! it's very flattering and comfortable, and all the buttons keep the wrap in check. i've gotten lots of compliments on it. also, it's got pockets!
12189	Love the shirt! fits great and is so cute! a must have for fall!
12190	I ordered 3 different styles of jogger pants and these were definitely the ones to keep! true to size and instantly comfortable due to the soft material they are made from. the taupe color i got will go with a lot, too. these are great pants that you won't be sorry you bought!
12191	Beautiful sweater, perfect length, surprisingly warm
12192	I ordered two of these in orange as holiday gifts this year. both were loved! great style and quality will hopefully make this a go-to sweater for both recipients.
12193	I would have loved this tee but the color didn't love me. it's sort of a mustard orange. the embroidery is beautifully done but i felt the size of the yarn tassels were too big and looked a bit odd, but i have a large bust so don't like to draw attention there. it's a sweatshirt and not a tee shirt, but it flows and doesn't grab anywhere. it looked so nice under a jean jacket. if it weren't for the color and tassels, it would be a keeper for me.
12194	Believe the reviews - this dress is very flattering, great quality, and an excellent print (i got the polka dot). i was concerned about the wrap front since i am busty - 32dd - but this looks great, is appropriate for work. love!
12195	I love the mustard color and fun boho details of this shirt, however the sizing was a little weird. i ordered the small petite first and it was just too short (which is rarely a problem i have), so i ordered it in the regular small. it's perfect in length, but a little loose on top, which i'm fine with. overall, very happy with this purchase and have received many compliments on it.
12196	Nice warm long cardigan that can work for many seasons. works well over a dress.
12197	This vest looks exactly as in pictures which is a good thing for online exclusives. i love the fact that it's lined and the texture and color of the fabric is very nice. has a good, solid quality feel to it. it does not have any buttons or belt that comes with it but looks perfectly fine just left opened. i wore it with belt as well and it add to the structured styling of the vest. more on the conservative side of retailer.
12198	I have been searching for the perfect white shirt. this is it! i love how the collar lays and the longer length and frayed hem are perfection! the fabric is super soft, too. i am very pleased with this purchase!
12199	Great sweater for casual days. just the right length and fabric weight. very versatile. fit is true to size not oversized.
12200	This is a cute top although it runs fairly large. i have washed it once and the fray did ok; however, i'm a bit concerned about how the shirt will wash over time with the frayed edges.
12201	
12202	Love, love love this top. it's got a little bit of a native american vibe without being over-the-top. i tend to wear a small in retailer, but the medium was the way to go for me. it's not long, and the style errs on the not-tight side. if you can go between two sizes, don't get the smaller one. and i love the shade of yellow!
12203	A great wrap dress with many buttons, the dress stays on better than any other wrap dress i ever owned.
12204	Great for the beachy business look. classy, but immensely comfortable. i feel like i look sharp without having to sit poker-straight.
12205	This top is as pictured. i'm 5 feet 120 pounds. the small petite was a great fit. the material is cozy, soft and somewhat thick. dress it casual with jeans or elevate it with slacks.
12206	Received this dress for christmas and fell in love. the detail and fit is perfection. the buttons go all the way to the bottom of the skirt so no concern for pesky flyaway exposure should the wind blow. the detail on the arms w the buttons is also cute and i personally loved the longer sleeve that almost comes to my elbow - it's very flattering. overall a great little dress!
12207	I came into the store to try another dress on and was given this dress to try. it is perfect! i paired it with black tights and tall boots for a family photo. i got it in the wine color. highly recommend and very fun for winter. it does run really large. i usually wear a small but got an extra small.
12208	It is such a cute dress. the mulit-colored aspect allows me to wear many different color shoes with it. the dress can be formal or informal, and it works for a myriad of occasions. please purchase it!!!!
12209	"This is a lovely sweater - the ""moss"" color however is really camel, which is what the photo indicates. it fits tts, is all cashmere, and is knit in a brioche stitch that gives it loft and texture that can be seen well in the detail photo. i am generally not a fan of raglan sleeves but in this case it works with the overall construction of the sweater - one that features interesting decreases, lines, and angles. it is very soft, warm, and lightweight, and can be worn as a casual piece or dressed"
12210	I was excited to see this dress as i'd bought the sparrow boiled wool sheath dress in xs last year and loved the fit. however, this dress does not fit the same way. the top fits fine, but the waist and the bottom are way too big. i laid it over my sparrow dress from last year, and the bottom is at least an inch wider (two inches, if you go by the total circumference). i'm planning to exchange for an xxs and see if that one fits better.
12211	I purchased this in grey and wine and both are wonderful. the boiled wool is light but warm and not itchy. fits nicely through the bodice and flares out to create a nice shape. the pockets are terrific and lay nice and flat. i'm short but the petite was well above my knee. i could have worn petite small just fine. it fit nicely in the bodice - the smaller size brought the seaming up a bit higher to form a more empire waist, but i chose the petite medium because i wanted it loose through the wais
12212	"I bought this on a whim.  i have a difficult time finding a great fitting suit, especially online!    this suit is structured so well.  the material will seemingly last way longer than most of my other suits that are priced much higher.  the material i feel holds in my stomach. i have a large bust and it is comfortably supported in this.     the design is so cute and i love the way the way crisscrossed.  it makes a one piece feel less like a one piece."
12213	This dress in coral is a beautiful color and awesome material. only problem is it runs a little big- i am a pretty true to size small and should've ordered an xs- the hips are a little wide and v in the neck a little low. instead of sending back i just wore a camisole and leggings w ankle boots and it looked very cute regardless.
12214	Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit, you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me, it may work better on curvier figures.
12215	This piece is very comfortable and feels well made. it is not slimming.
12216	"I have had a lot of complements while wearing this dress. i purchased it in the grey. other reviews felt that this dress ran large. i agree that it might be a little larger than other retailer purchases i have made but not by much. i purchased it in small (usually what i wear in dresses) i'm very tall at 5'9"" (mostly legs) and the length is great. also the neck line is perfect on me and i have a fairly average torso length. . i am very happy with the purchase."
12217	"First, i love wool. if it's 100% wool, i love it. if wool isn't your thing, then this dress isn't for you. i ordered this dress online in the burgundy. it is not itchy. it falls above my knees and i am 5'3"". it is warm and cozy with pockets, which i love. with the sleeves being short, i am wearing a long, frilly cardigan over it. i ordered the small (did not notice a size chart with this product). i am usually a size 4 or 6. it fits great in the bodice, but runs large through the hips. however,"
12218	This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size, though a bit boxy, so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side, but i'm petite, so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear, but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased
12219	I did not like this cashmere sweater at all. i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color. although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40% off.
12220	Loved that this was an 100% boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large. i tried the small and extra small - both were really large in the hips. i will maybe try the xxs - was hoping to make this is winter staple.
12221	Love the warm fuzzies of this sweater, did not love the unflattering cut. the sweater hung lifelessly from my bust line down. plus, it was a little short in the front. i have to send it back. :(
12222	I had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available, and lets say i was swimming in the xl, much to big. so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg. when i compare the two, the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl, seems like quite a big jump in the sizing. the suit fits in the body quite well, however it's a bit snug in the side bust area. strangely, the suit has boning on the side of the bust, and also the silicone grip on the top edge,
12223	I love this shirt!  it's super comfy and i love the design and detail.  it does run large, so order a size down.
12224	This dress is really beautiful. i have already worn it to both an engagement party (fancy) and just out to dinner (casual); it fits most occasions, depending on what you pair it with, which always makes me feel like i have gotten my full money's worth. i've gotten several compliments on it; the best one being that it looks as though i was wearing a piece of art! the outside material of the dress is silky in texture and has a nice sheen to it. it looks true to the picture on the website. the dres
12225	"The dress is great for pear shapes. however, i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing. ordered a small (5'8"" 140#) and i still think it may be a bit big. the material is very comfortable, not too thick or thin. however, i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric. see the attached photo."
12226	I love this dress so much that i purchased it in both grey and wine. i find the cut very flattering and slimming, and love the pockets. it works great for northern california winters, with tights, boots, boiled wool sweatercoat over it while outdoors, and on its own indoors. i wish there was a long-sleeved version. i feel exceptionally cute and cozy while wearing it. good job, sparrow! btw, i bought the other currently offered sparrow wool dress (the mock-neck dress), and this one is just an inc
12227	"Overall, this swimsuit is what i needed and have been looking for. i normally wear bikinis but i needed a one piece, and i wanted something unique and different. i ordered the chevron print, and i do love the colors and ""retro"" look of the swimsuit. if i could change a couple of things, i would have the legs and booty slightly more high cut -- but not much. and i might have wanted the option to take off some, if not all, of the straps. other than that, i do love it...and i doubt that anyone else"
12228	I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.
12229	Love this sweater but it's too large. will exchange for smaller size because i really want it.
12230	"Such a unique mix of prints but it totally works. much better and more vibrant in person. true to size. fits more like a maxi on me since i'm 5'1"""
12231	The sweater is very soft. it has an interesting pattern. i purchased the neutral color in size xs which runs tts. it's definitely a cozy sweater to wear this winter.
12232	This top is super cute. the color is beautiful and the lace detail is very feminine. im a 36c and got the size small. it fits great.
12233	I agree with some of the other reviewers; this dress runs very large. when i tried on the xs in my local store, i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole, but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home, it was just too roomy and not fitted enough. i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better. it is an adoreable design, cut and color. it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it.
12234	I wanted to love this dress. i bought the cranberry color and it really is gorgeous. the cut was wrong for my body type. it is a bit roomier than expected. but i wear a size 36ddd so the seams on the chest hit at a very awkward spot. i'm sure it would look great on someone with a smaller chest
12235	This bathing suit is so cute. it fits me great. i'm 5'10 and about 130 and ordered a medium. my only complaint is that the outside straps sometimes fall off my shoulders, which could be annoying if you are doing anything active. but overall a great, modest and cute swimsuit.
12236	
12237	Les fauves is another version of last years larkhill swing dress but better.  one, the swing has less to swing, but in a good way!  they reduced the voluminous amount of material while retaining the fun swing aspect. two, the dress is shorter so it's more flattering to the vertically challenged like me. what's the same?  still wonderful silk, discreet pockets, beautiful abstract floral print and those horrid little buttons that are difficult to fasten on the back of a tight neckband collar.  i h
12238	The moment i laid eyes on this beauty, i was mesmerized.  there's so much going on with the print but it all works.  it's so fun and flattering and versatile since the variety of colors go with just about every thing i own in my closet.  it can be fancied up or casualed down depending on your shoes and accessories.  like the first reviewer recommended, size down.  i bought an 8 instead of 10 and my bust is 36dd with a wide rib cage.  i really wish this was a midi on me but alas no petite sizes w
12239	The collar from a distance looks like it has seen better days (very scruffy), but it is so silky soft. and the slight sheen to the jacket is a nice twist to an ordinary army type. the fabric is definitely thinner than i expected, but it&#39;s also softer and better for layering.
12240	I dig this jacket very much because i can wear it like a thick shirt or as a jacket, and the removable collar gives even more versatility. i am short so i opted for regular xs (i'm 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), the bit of spandex stretch helps me achieve the fitted look without looking too tight. i love military green color, it's a happier neutral than black or brown. without saying, it goes with everything and flatters all body types.
12241	I wanted to love this dress! i ordered it when there was a 20 percent off special and couldn't wait to get it. the colors are as depicted and the dress fit true to size. i also liked that it wasn't too short. what i didnt like was that the dress is lined in white, which you can plainly see in the picture, but i didnt notice before ordering. i just think it would have been much prettier lined in black. im disappointed and the dress is going back.
12242	I'm 5' 120 and the 4p fit like a glove. i have a bigger chest and there is no pulling on the buttons. the colors and fit on the dress are perfect. i had so many compliments when i wore it!
12243	I loved this dress before putting it on, but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type. it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for. sadly this will be going back. i loved the print and the feel of the material. just not a flattering cut for me.
12244	"Found this dress at my local retailer. . it was one of those dresses that just catches your eye.. very,very, beautiful print. . the dress is loose and flowy and feels so comfortable on. i purchased it without a second thought. i am 5'1"" and usually wear a 0 or 2 and the 2 was a better fit for me. so breezy and cool for summer."
12245	This dress does run large, but i'm wearing it loose and flowy. bought it for desert trip music festival, with booties and a hat or headband, very hippie chic. my husband thinks it's adorable! the prints are darling.
12246	"First one i received was ripping apart already in the sleeve opening at wrist (warning: very tight sleeves!), plus 2"" of the green shiny band detail was missed altogether by whomever sewed this particular one- just left unstitched. and long threads were hanging in several places. this is by no means a quality piece and is severely overpriced. on the positive side, it is very cute and i'm keeping the replacement one, but know that it is also delicate. after one use, there is a snag on the inside"
12247	So cute, so comfortable, so pretty - so i guess i love everything about it. it is not too short on me and i think you can wear it in many ways... thought of adding a vest - thought of boots - can't wait to wear it. i agree the material is substantial so it isn't flimsy for fall or winter. happy with this purchase. runs true to size. i went with the op. i sometimes chose regular length, but this one is just right in the petite. i have long arms but these sleeves are just right. i am 5 ft. tall, b
12248	"This jumpsuit is cuter than it looks online. my store displayed it with a brown belt, which dresses it up. it is perfect for our hot summers with brown or silver sandals. i will wear it with a short sleeve white cotton tee. i'm 5' 7"" and bought the extra small. pricey but worth it, so stylish. so retailer!"
12249	Great piece. using as a night gown. slept in it last night. like a dream.
12250	"I like the make of this dress, the fabric is thick and light at the same time. the cut is loose and flattering. the different patterns are also very fun. colors are gorgeous, nice details. the buttons are sturdy.  i tried on both 0p and 00p - not much difference in the 2 (i would go petite if you are on the short side). the 00p was just a bit snugger near the =chest, but didn't gape. the waist is definitely meant to be looser, so don't expect a fitted dress. length was slightly above the knee"
12251	"Very quick delivery. ordered sunday and in my mailbox tuesday before noon! nice fit, length is perfect. i'm 5'3"" and the regular size 6 hits just above the knee. one thing is the nice little button in the back fell off just as i was going to try it on. found on the floor and i will just sew it back on. other than that i love the print and everything about the dress. true to size. ?? retailer"
12252	I love the unusual print, but the cut didn't work for me. i've got a round back side and a sway back, and the dress made me look twice as big front to back than i actually am because there's no shaping to help it adjust to the curves. so sad!
12253	Great basic tank with a bit of a 'flair' at bottom that makes it super cute. will layer with cute bra most likely. the coral color is great, too. very pretty. i also got the white.
12254	I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful, both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees, not like shown in the picture here. on that note, i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.
12255	The fit on this shirt is bizarre--it very much resembles a nursing top (but wouldn't actually work for that purpose). the side visible in the picture is nicely draped, but the other side can flap open and is completely different. i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate!
12256	This dress is even more beautiful in person. it fits true to size and drapes nicely from the body without being tent-like, as some swing dresses are prone to be. the material is very nice and the pattern is stunning and unique. as someone else mentioned, you can pair this with a cardi for work. it's also perfect for a night out. it's easily dressed up or down. and looks amazing with a skinny belt. i'm happy i bought this one!
12257	Love this dress!!! thought the colors would be too much but it actually isn't and is just so cute. got a ton of compliments on it when i wore it! the material is light but not see through at all. the length is perfect and comfortable to sit around in. this will be my go to dress this fall!
12258	Oh my! this dress fits wonderfully on! so ready for autumn! i have a big bust, this dress does not split at the buttons.
12259	Got this in gray, pretty good quality, all around good basic.
12260	I know this is labeled under activewear, but the fabric is a dream, it's incredibly flattering and could absolutely be worn in any outfit! i just bought the moss and may end up getting the other colors too. i generally am a l or xl, and the large fit well. it's alined and has a bit of stretch to it. it's so comfortable! highly recommend!
12261	"I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim thinking it be a great throwback to the 70s. it is actually very flattering on, with the lines running down vertical, giving a slimming look to any figure. it is also very soft and comfortable on, and has nice, large pockets on the sides. it doesn't look dated at all once on, and i'm sure will get plenty of use as the weather warms up. for reference, i'm 5'7"" tall, and weigh close to 130 lbs., and found the small fit well. the only drawback was the pice, but i"
12262	This is a great top. i almost walked right by it because it is so simplistic compared to the other things in retailer. i just wanted something super casual and this fits the bill. the fabric is a dream and it has a nice drape without being overly voluminous. i usually love white tops but the white was my least favorite. i ended up getting the moss and the gray. i could have gotten either the xs or the s. i went with the small because it was a little longer and had a wee bit more room in the upper
12263	I generally wear a 27. jeans fit perfectly. skinny, but not too skinny.
12264	I was so excited to receive this romper. it's a great material, but it's actually a bit drab. the colors are very bland and the flowers just hang. it's not flattering as it is very roomy.
12265	Saw this dress in the retailer catalog and tried on in store. didn't need a dress but ended up purchasing as will be wearable for summer/early fall. seems like a print dress cut and style that will be used for many seasons. outer fabric is a bit delicate/may snag, and a bit wrinkly as another reviewer said, but works with the dress.
12266	I own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance. i was hoping these would be the same. i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front. i have no desire to have a bra/sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric, it is tacky!
12267	This dress is very comfortable and casual, but in a high quality fabric that makes it great for a summer dinner with dressy sandals. i don't think a bra can be worn with it which i don't mind at all but might be a problem for others.
12268	These citizens of humanity jeans are indeed pricy but worth the money. they fit slim through the hips and not too loose in the legs to make you feel like they are huge...very versatile and look fabulous with a cropped sweater or even a hip length top. add a pair of chunky shoes and you have a great look. i even tried them with dansko clogs and they looks cute. it's a great break from skinny jeans and much more chic than boyfriend jeans.
12269	I think this dress is very pretty and i like that it's made of silk.  i also like the way it fits since it skims over my figure flaws without being too poufy.  what i don't like is the sloppiness of how the print was stitched on my dress.  the print frame is offset and details are cut off in both the front and back (you can see similar in the model shot from behind).  for the price i was expecting a little more quality control.  i also do not care for the lining.  i do not think the off white is
12270	What a great purchase (especially on sale!) as this tank can't get more comfy. the material is soft and great to wear during those warm weather months. love it!
12271	I stumbled upon this dress yesterday at the store and fell in love with it! i wore it today with boots and received tons of compliments. it is light, comfortable and flattering. i love that it is machine washable, too!
12272	"This is a beautiful dress. it fits true to size. i have some issues around the middle and this just flows away from the body. i am 5'5"" and it falls to the knee on me, longer than pictured on the model. the fabric is a nice weight that can be worn three seasons. the print is pretty and romantic. i'm planning to wear this to my daughter's very informal wedding and know i'll be comfortable and look put together. this was a lucky find!"
12273	I saw this top online and fell in love with it, as i live in white cotton comfy tanks, but i was concerned that it might make me look like i was wearing a tent from the side profile since i am top heavy - 36d, and i happen to have this problem with some tops and dresses. so i went into the store to try it on in a size l and i was shocked how not only did it not look like a tent it had a slimming effect! i felt so attractive in it i had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror (believe me this
12274	I loved this dress when i saw it online! i could not wait until i see in one of the local stores.  i bought it today! unlike other reviews, i think this dress runs large. i am a 4 and bought the zero. maeve tends to run large on me. i would suggest that you try a size smaller. it looks very flattering!
12275	This dress rules.  so comfy, and versatile.  flattering cut.  great with flats, wedges, booties, boots with tights.  easily my new fav.  runs large.  i am usually a 6/8 and the 4 was perfect after i steamed it.  no button gap either, i am a 34c.
12276	I got one of these tanks, and went back and bought two more online. i have the gray, green and white. the white requires a undershirt for me, but that's no problem. the shirts are darling, they're under activewear and i think they could be used that way, but i definitely don't. they're simple but have a nice flow, and the front and back are perfect. i love the material and the colors. i would buy more if there was more in more natural tones, i don't love bright colors but i love the green, white
12277	Loved it! i am curvy and it is very hard to find a dress that looks easy and at the same time shapes you. the various cuts of the different prints are placed in the right place in the body . easy dress and beautiful. there should be more dresses in this style in different color combos.
12278	"I'm 5'8"" and 130 and this made me look huge. it was a small but too billowy. it is pretty, nice fabric and well made but i returned."
12279	I bought a xs in black. i like the weight, texture, and thickness of this fabric. it feels like it smoothes over and holds the lines of my body in well. may be the other reviewer got a pair out of an odd batch, which could mean there are inconsistencies? i would like to see how the color and the stretch holds up with future washes. it would have gotten five stars since if it came in petitte length. but i will pick up a couple of more if it hits sale.
12280	I love this dress, but it is inches shorter than the description says or shows. i am only 5'7 and it is 2 to 3 inches above my knee. otherwise, it is a loose fit and hides all problem areas.
12281	A seasonal must have. nicely made. medium weight. cozy. buttons to half way down. i am petite and the xs fits with enough room for layers underneath. highly recommend.
12282	
12283	Fit is oversized but intentional. flattering on. love the neckline. modesty might call for a tank top underneath if bending over. fabric is soft, stretchy and has a good quality heft to it.
12284	I saw this on sale, and it looked lovely online. i really wanted to love it when i received it. it looked great, but once i tried it on, it bunches up in the back. it looks awkward. the lace and small details are pretty, but the fit is just off. returned it in the store.
12285	Wish this worked for me! i am 5'9''. it is much shorter than it looks in the photo and the pockets did not hit my hips or torso in the right spot. the neck was kind of tight on me too. i love the idea of this dress but need it longer. the dress is very roomy overall.
12286	These pants are comfortable and cozy. great for lounging around and cute enough to wear out of the house to coffee or running errands. i'll be wearing them a lot.
12287	"The dress is very pretty, however the description is deceiving. i purchased it not just for the look but because it was listed as ""silk"" but that is not exactly true. the under-slip is silk but the outer dress, what you see is definitely not. it is a cheap, thin material on top, skirt is stiff,, not loose or flowy as the picture would have you think. i will keep it, very happy i did not pay full price."
12288	This would have been cute if it was more fitted. i am 5'7 and 125 lbs and the small was too wide. i didn't try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length.
12289	Love this top. perfect under a jacket for work or on its own for date night. i have a long torso and the length is perfect. so dainty and different!
12290	I purchased this dress for myself. however, when i tried it on at home the length was too short. i gave the dress to a relative who is petite and the dress fit her perfectly.
12291	I have been eyeing these pants for about a month or so; every time i stopped by my local retailer store i would check them out but never actually bought them. well, today i finally went for it and i am so glad i did! the floral pattern is very feminine yet unique and the colors are uplifting and cheerful for spring. the material is very soft, light and flowy and i'm sure will be comfortable in the heat of summer. the only drawback i found was that the fabric is not very stretchy and i like to be a
12292	This cut and shape of this skirt is very flattering. i am normally a medium but the small fit and looked much better- less bulky. the material is nice almost sweater like but not so heavy. it's a very versatile skirt. highly recommend.
12293	It's like a work of art, but sadly, not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look, and even considered taking it to a tailor, but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips, you might love it. very sad to return this.
12294	
12295	Love this dress. going to wear it for thanksgiving. love the material.
12296	These are very pretty, but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package, i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however, even though they are machine washable, i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also, the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing, which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.
12297	"I recommend this topper but with reservations. it is beautiful looking, especially the lace portion.  it is also very wide. the gathered portion is a complete design fail, it balloons up right below the bust, making one look wide and pretty ridiculous. it's obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body. but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise.  i ordered size s, the smallest available, and it fit very wide more like a"
12298	I was shopping for a holiday outfit today at my retailer store, and my sales associate suggested i try on this top. i have lo idea where it was on the store l, yet it's a very pretty top that stands out when you have it on. i took this in a small because it's meant to run shorter. i felt xs would have been too small. i purchased it to wear with jeans or dress pants. pretty detail. blouse shows off my arms and minimizes my waist. i love it!
12299	I was so excited about this top, and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely, but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated, and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.
12300	I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely, more of a grayish blue, and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good, as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger, so it does sit on your hips, however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape
12301	"I love these sleep pants they are the perfect length. i' am 5'10 and slim these fit great, its so hard to find pants that fit tall slender women."
12302	I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.
12303	"These jeans fit great, but i think getting the right size is key. i bought my usual denim size 26 and at first i thought they were too tight. but as the day wore on, they softened and conformed to my body and fit like a glove. if i bought them in a larger size, i'm afraid they'd bag out like jeans tend to do. i think it's the ""legging"" style that makes them so form fitting. i wish they were ankle length like on the model, but i'm 5'5"" and they are quite a bit longer on me than the model."
12304	It was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height. the pull-on styling is a #fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening! i was afraid it might rip a seam. the fabric seems low quality, like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others. overall, not the dress or quality i expected :/
12305	"When i unwrapped this a chemical ""stink"" hit me that amost knocked me over. it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells. second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut. the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner. i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here. with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out. i do not recommend this fo"
12306	"I have been looking at this top online & today i tried it on in the store in a size small and xs regular. i am 5'3"", 120 lbs. 34b, and the xs fit better than small. in the small the armholes were too low & showed my bra. this is the regular cut, not even petite (& note i am on the shorter side) & the length was a few inches shorter than i would like. glad i didn't order this online in petite. i love the detail & the material looks wellmade, with the exception of the beading in one spot was alrea"
12307	
12308	Very cute dress, but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldn't be pressed out.
12309	"I love this dress, but it is too short to keep. i am 5'8"" and weigh 124lbs. most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small, but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer. it looks adorable on, but it is just too short (about 3 inches above my knees) to be considered professional enough to wear to work."
12310	"I ordered this coat in a size xs during the promo. it just arrived & is too big. sleeves way too long & big under the arms. it's labeled xs but looks more like a m. i don't mind an oversized fit & having the sleeves altered but this is just not working. if petite were available it may work for me. it is nicely made, soft, comfy, button front which i prefer instead of snaps. i think it wld be super cozy on a cold day. love the print! i am of small build, 5'3"", 115#, usually a xs-s, occas petite."
12311	First mermaid-ish skirt ever that's flattering enough to pull off with a curvy lower body. the material is light-weight sweater knit that hugs in all the right places and its unique cut along the bottom make it very in the moment. the color is a rich, deep, gorgeous brown with subtle highlights that draw from whatever top you pear with it. runs large so size down.
12312	Length too long and waist to high. these are not sized for petites.
12313	I had higher hopes for this top and thought it would be fanicer. but as a previous reviewer mentioned, the quality of the material and elastic waistband makes the top look a little cheaper in person. i'm glad i got it on sale with the extra 25% off.  i was hoping to exchange it for a small, but it's sold out by now. the top runs a little large. normally i'm between a small and a medium, but i think a small might even be too big. i put it on this morning in the dark and by the time i got to work
12314	"Love the mara hoffman basketweave bikini bottoms in fractals red. i went to her website for the size chart and got these in a size 'm'. very good fit, just a bit cheekier than her classic cut bikini bottoms. i got them with the matching basketweave bikini top. . i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37 to 38 depending on where i measure. upper hipbones are 34""; fuller thighs and bottom, so i never know what to order. i think a size 's' would be too skimpy so i hope these hold up well in the waves.  . co"
12315	I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall, thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest, and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.
12316	"This is a beautiful well designed top. the pattern is laid out to match on each side. the back has a narrow center insert of sheer fabric, for an interesting detail, with wonderful construction. this sheer fabric is also added to the bottom as an edging . this measures only 1 1/4"" wide and lays flat and finished off well. the sleeves have excess fabric for comfort but do not make one's arms look heavy. the unusual neckline shape in the front is well sewn and lays flat nicely. i think this top is"
12317	I love this skirt; but it is so long that i have ordered the petite as well to see which one i will keep. i am tall; but even pulled up higher than my waist, there is at least 3 inches too much in length and i want to wear a flat shoe or boot with it. if i keep this one, it will need to be altered.  it has pockets which i love. it is an effortless long skirt which i will wear christmas day for sure. the pattern is stunning with the mixed prints. the fabric is silky. it can be dressed down with a
12318	I ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening. after seeing the other reviews i wasn't sure about it, but i was very pleased when it arrived. i find it is elegant and sexy, but also modest enough when i sized up by 1. i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly. it is form-fitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight. i'm excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace.
12319	
12320	All of my friends loved these pants- as did i! these are so gorgeous. the sequins seem well stitched. the small fit me well- hanging straight as pictured, not too snug or uncomfortable. they hit me at the ankle. there are back pockets.
12321	I can't stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric. i don't consider that high-quality.
12322	These have been a staple for me the last three years. i have owned three pairs of them in black. i haven't been able to find them in black for some time and i need these back in my life!!! please please bring them back!!
12323	These are true to size and photo. i wore them to the opera and cant wait to wear them with sandals and a tee this summer!
12324	I think this shirt would be really cute on the right body type, just not mine. i'm 5'5, 125 and a 34ddd a couple weeks post partum. thought this could be a good shirt while i'm nursing bc it's flowy but stylish. unfortunately it did nothing for me when i put it on. the cut drew all attention to my big chest---not in a good way--and distracted from my smaller lower half. made me look much bigger and heavier than i actually am. probably good for small chested girls, very tall girls or curvy on the
12325	These pants fit true to size. i have a small waist and curvy hips, and while i have always loved the low rise ag stevie, these offer more coverage at the back with the same great slim fit through the leg. the length is also great for those of us who are not super tall. the have some stretch but i wore them several times without washing and the never got baggy in the knees or other stretch points. i own two other pairs of ag stevie in traditional denim and they still look great after years of wea
12326	I bought this top on the advice of another tall reviewer and i'm so happy that i did.  this is the perfect top for tall girls.  i did size down from my usual large to a medium. the top was still oversized, but in a very pretty way.  i love the material.  this top is so soft and extremely comfortable. the v neckline is very pretty and not too low.  i can see myself dressing this up with nicer pants for work or with skinny jeans for a more casual look.  if you are a tall girl, this top is a must h
12327	These looked so fun, i had to have them! i usually wear a 14 in pants, but the large fit well. despite a lack of thigh gap and walking in these all night, i didn't lose a single sequin. they're comfortable and get a ton of compliments. if you're considering them, i definitely recommend going for it!
12328	This silk skirt was not the best look for me, but may work for others. i purchased the med, which fit fine. i just wasn't in love with the print/colors. the skirt has quality material and is well made. it's very light and airy. i did return it.
12329	I wish these zipped up instead of the drawstring. they are super cute but don't care for the way they sit on the hips.
12330	"What a great top! i am 5'9"" - 136 lbs with a 34d chest.. and this top looks and feels great on. i am usually a 6 and the small fit perfectly. i purchased the grey and it is a nice medium grey color. the v in front hits in a great spot.. not too low, but just low enough to look feminine. i haven't washed and dried the top yet, so i hope it looks as good after washing as it does brand new. i was hesitant to order because of the earlier reviews, but i find this top really works for me, so i am glad"
12331	"These are great pants. i was nervous because when i saw them at the store they looked pretty linty but after wearing them a number of times they are not bad. i have to run a lint roller over them occasionally but not more than other black pants. i wear these to work and they are very comfortable. kind of stretchy, but very flattering. the higher rise than the other stevies makes them work really well for work-allows them to look less ""jean"" like. i highly recommend these-can't believe they aren'"
12332	I love these jeans, cant believe i never purchased them earlier. i'm always a 30 in paige and ag and this was no different. i will say that i did fit into the 29, so it could be that they run slightly large. the fabric is amazing!! and the white is perfect. love that it is not see through and fabric is substantial.the length for me at 5'5 was at my ankle. i loved them so much that i bought them in white and beige/cream. highly recommend.
12333	I was returning some things when i saw these jeans and had to try them on! they must be magical pants, because they are slimming and very flattering! amazing jeans!
12334	"I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer. it is cute though!"
12335	I spend most of my time searching for the perfect pair of jeans (okay, maybe a slight exaggeration, but only slight). finally, the the ag stevie's are it. this is my third pair. now, for more colors...
12336	I love the neckline on this - sharp enough for work, but cute for a fun night out too. only complaint is it's soooo flowy on the bottom. i could hide a baby under here for sure. i got the medium thank goodness or it would have been ridiculous. i'm 5'8, 160lbs. great for fall.
12337	I agree with the first reviewer. this dress is just ok; nothing to write home about. if you need a throw on dress in a pinch, it's nice to have on hand, but there are probably a lot of other retailer dresses that fit the bill that are better quality than this one. it is also very body conscious in the back. the material is a thin, ribbed rayon - on the cheap side. overall, it's a comfortable piece, but it's more like a thin, long-sleeve t-shirt, rather than a quality dress. it would have been a gr
12338	It is a proper fitting oversized shirt. however, it is very flimsy and even see-through as a summer weight shirt. i returned it because i don't want to wear a tank or cami under it during hot weather.
12339	"I love the way the neckline is open not too low ! it also falls on your hips just right.  great buy"
12340	I think these jeans are amazing. they are very flattering and most of all comfortable. i often will go up a size when buying white but i didn't have to with these. they also relax very nicely as you wear them. buying white jeans has always been a challenge, often they are to thin and not that flattering. i don't feel the same about these, they are the perfect summer white jean. i think i need another pair!
12341	I have owned a lot of stevies in the past. the only problem with them for me has been the rise. i have always thought they would have been perfect with a bit of a higher rise. voila! these have the perfect mid rise (for me). they are really soft. too long for my 29 inch inseam. they bunch at the ankles, but don't drag. i would love for them to have a skinnier ankle, but i also think they're fine how they are. i bought my normal size. they may turn out to be a tiny bit loose after wearing them. t
12342	"This shirt is enormous and, as the title of my review suggests, it looks like a men's button down. the fabric is quite sheer, but that's actually what i liked best about it. i just looked completely shapeless in this top & wish i had realized it before i wore it out because i would definitely have returned it. perhaps if i had bought it 2 sizes smaller i might have liked it better - it didn't fit anything like the model photos suggest - it's huge. not ""easy/slouchy""."
12343	"Beautiful suit. i had been eyeing this one for weeks and finally decided to just buy the darn thing.  it is tiny, just beware. as in it doesn't cover much, especially on the booty. not a bad thing, but buyer beware :) if you are looking for more coverage, size up. i wear a 32d and ordered a medium top. good thing i didn't get a small. i have to get the band taken in a bit, but i need the coverage in the cup.  for the bottoms i also got a medium and usually wear a small or medium in swimwear bo"
12344	"I saw this top at my local store and tried it on a whim. it is so much cuter in person than it looks online - i wouldn't have given it a second look based on these pictures... it perhaps runs a tiny bit large, but i stuck with my usual size small since it hung nicer on my body than the xs did. if you're thin you may want to size down - i have a decent amount of ""padding"" that keeps me from wanting to wear anything fitted (5'4"", 130 lbs). the little dots are more prevalent in person and the peplu"
12345	"Gorgeous color (plum) and is very comfy. the lace at the top is just enough to be feminine, but not too much to be trashy. like many of the other reviewers, i sized this down and am glad that i did. i think the larger size would have been ""tent like""."
12346	The dahlia bell sleeve blouse is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. i have already worn it several times, with white cropped denim or the cropped fringed pilcro denim jeans. it also looks great with the pilcro rolled shorts in navy or white. i took my usual size large, and though the fabric seems like it may be sheer, if you wear a nude bra you do not need a cami beneath. the blue band hits right about the waist of your jeans so your jeans don't show thru either. this blouse is lightweight and v
12347	I do not even know where to begin with this product. i ordered a small (i go between small and medium) and felt that would be a good fit. after trying on the shirt, i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is. this shirt is very boxy. i know its supposed to have a 'flow' to it, but this shirt is too much. it needs to be taken in. or have a belt wrapped around it. i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering. i found this color to be very blah. overall, i am slig
12348	Cute staple in classic style overall.  fabric weight is good, will be able to get by with nude bra.  many wardrobe options with this staple.
12349	I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.
12350	This top is fabulous! so comfy and the lace at the top is just right. it does run a little big but drapes so well it looks fine...i got the plum but tempted to get the ivory,,,especially at the sale price! a steal...
12351	"I tried this on in the store, in regular size (i often need petite). i think on this one, i could go either way.  the cut is flattering fit and flare, and the colors are rich. i like the ""flowery"" design, good spring piece in my opinion, as it has components of all kinds of seasons: sleeveless and see-though material, buthe design part is almost like a fine corduroy, very soft. not too flimsy iether."
12352	Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering.
12353	This cardigan/sweater/jacket is splendidly soft, wonderfully warm and super stylish. i wear it with a navy pencil skirt or leggings. this piece will be timeless.
12354	I ordered the ivory in xl. when i received it, there was more material than i expected. but, after washing & air-drying, it shrunk a lot. it's pretty and comfortable. worth getting on sale.
12355	Liked the netting around the collar but the whole blouse was very baggy. order size down.
12356	This sweater jacket is beautiful. the picture doesn't do it justice. works very well with a tank underneath and a skirt or over a knee length dress. wore with boots and received many compliments. it's classy.
12357	I loved this top when i saw it online, and ordered it right away. however, the fit is way off. i am always a size medium. always. but i was swimming in this and had to return it. even if it had fit, i wasn't thrilled with it. i thought it would be something i could dress up, especially with the lace detail, but instead it looked really frumpy. i would recommend this top as long as you know to order a smaller size and are looking for something a little more casual.
12358	The dress is very cute, probably more on the casual side. i ordered the 2 petite and it hits me a few inches above the knee, which is what i wanted. the material of the dress and under slip is a little thin, but it looked nice after i ironed it. the top part of the dress looks great and shows off my shoulders nicely.
12359	Looks great with jeans for a more bohemian look.  i normally wear a medium but went large to accommodate a 6 month pregnant belly.  the blouse is loose enough i probably could have stayed with the medium.
12360	This is very comfortable, and pretty top. i love the pleated peplum and the flutter sleeves. the v-neck is the right height, and the embroidered polka-dots are very sweet. i got many complements wearing this perfect for summer top!
12361	Great top! super cute. runs a little big, i usually purchase l but the m fit better. it's thin, but not see through, so it lays well.
12362	I was hoping to love this tunic, but it isn't what i was hoping for. the material is cute, but the piece itself is a little too baggy and just doesn't do anything for my shape. just made me look boxy all around. it felt more like a poncho than a tailored tunic. unfortunately, it has to go back.
12363	I absolutely love the dahlia bell-sleeve blouse. this blouse has a lovely flow. perfect for fall. sleeves have a slight bell that hang nicely. i would recommend this blouse to everyone!
12364	I purchased this in the ivory color in store and liked it so much i ordered the plum color on-line. i am almost always an xl, but this fit better in the l size. it's very soft and comfy and i love the swingy style. will be wearing it a lot!
12365	I'm happy with this sweater! a few things that may help others: 1) the detail on the yoke is made from a silky taupe-colored fiber, 2) it is ivory, not white and 3) although the fit is true to size, the sweater runs short, so if you prefer a longer fit you may want to size up.
12366	"This is one of my favorite tops! it is comfortable and an easy ""throw and go"" top. i am a big fan of denim tops and the lace on the back gives it that extra detail and flare. very pleased :)"
12367	I got this top in white and absolutely love it. the top can be tucked in or worn out, it is very elegant and will go well with skirts as well as pants and even jeans. can't wait to wear it.
12368	I'm always an xl in retailer blouses, and to be quite honest sometimes the xl are too tight to keep. however, in this blouse the size medium fits me like a normal size xl would, meaning i had to go down 2 sizes. even at size medium the blouse is still very loose and flowy. the body is cut like a trapeze a-line, so very forgiving. the fabric has a lot of stretch to it, so the arms aren't tight. the fabric is very comfortable and the lace detail is nice. just a heads up for anyone who would c
12369	First off, this top is super cozy! i adore an easy top that has beautiful detail - and this one does! the fabric is a lot like a thermal shirt, but not too warm. it's very stretchy!! not sure if it will stretch out with wear, but you could easily size down. the body has a ton of room. because of the cute cut, you could wear it oversized without it drowning you, or you could size down to keep it more slim. the lace is simple and even more beautiful in person! i highly recommend this one - especia
12370	I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that's how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it's comfortable on and loved the lace detail.
12371	Ordered this in my usual medium, knowing it was meant to be over-sized. but i could easily have put another of me (138 lbs. with junk in the trunk) inside it! so i'm returning it for a small, feeling sure that there'll still be enough extra for a slouchy look.
12372	This is a very loose fitting style jacket. if you like your jackets oversized, get your regular size. if you prefer the slightly loose (but not baggy) fit like the product photo, size down. as noted by another reviewer, the sleeves are incredibly long. i would say if you are a typical size 0 or 2 (unless you like the oversized fit), you are likely sized out of this jacket. it's a shame, because the quality is great and the windowpane print is beautiful. i'm sadly sized out.
12373	I bought the neutral color. this is a lightweight tunic sweater that can be worn during spring. the lace detail is so pretty...i ordered my normal size small and would have preferred an extra small...the top flows nice but would've been a better overall fit if i sized down. i'm 5'7 140 lbs for reference. make sure you size down at least 1 size.
12374	This dress is super flattering. i love everything about it!
12375	I am 6' and typically wear a size 8-10. i am a rather busty kind of gal (36h), so i usually order larges in tops so that i am sure there is no pull across my chest. i ordered a large in this top in the plum color. when i received the top, i could not stop laughing at how huge it was... the fit in the chest area is fine, but i can wrap the sides around me and tie them into a bow. at least half of the material needs to be removed! despite how huge the top is, it is very cute otherwise! i just mail
12376	The print and detail on this dress are so much better in person, especially the neckline! i agree with the previous reviewer in that it felt spring-timey to me. flattering fit and flare however the top runs extremely small. i am usually a 6 in retailer dresses and i could barely zip the 8 over my bust but the 10 was enormous. rest of the dress fit fine but if you are large up top you might want to size up. fabric does not stretch. overall too cute to pass up! for reference i am a 34dd.
12377	"Color of the dress matches color on my monitor. the neckline is sheer. i am 5'4"" ,125 lbs, 32d and ordered a size 6. i thought it fit perfect. this is a great spring/summer dress and can be worn with dress heels or flats for a dressier look. it can also be worm with tennis shoes (white converse are my choice) for a more casual look.  i think this dress could also transition to a fall/winter piece paired with tights and a suit jacket or cardigan.   also, i love the pockets, though i do see ho"
12378	What a beautiful flowing top. i am either a large or xl in tops but only needed a large in this top. i purchased it in the neutral color, but will probably get it in plum. if you have some flaws in your middle, this conceals everything. the material is so soft. you can dress it up or down and wear it from now until late fall. the plum color was beautiful, but i have more to wear with neutral. a great, versatile top.
12379	Really cute stress! i love the pattern and feel that this dress you can easily dress up or dress down. the neckline is the main reason why i bought the dress. it is a dress that hits above my knees so i like how modest it is. the slightly open back is also a nice touch. it's a dress that can easily be dressed up or dressed down. perfect spring dress!
12380	I'm 7months preggars and this top actually compliments my belly. extremely comfortable.
12381	I'm always on the hunt for good white blouses to pair with business casual attire or everyday wear. this was a great tank. i love the fabric. it's nice and sturdy and you don't have to worry about wearing a cami beneath it. this fabric does wrinkle some so bear that in mind. i really like the shape of the top near the shoulders. it's a great conservative cut. the little criss cross detail on the back adds a bit of charm to the top. i would definitely recommend this to others.
12382	This dress fits me perfect. the only complaint i have is that it was a little snug around the neck every now and then. it was a little snug getting in and out of the dress too. overall, the design is beautiful and it is definitely my new favorite.
12383	Usually the whole boho style looks funny on me, but the cut and print were subtle enough for me to pull it off. the colors are beautiful - probably flattering against any hair or skin tones...i took my usual small because the shoulders were generous enough. word of caution - this is dry clean only.
12384	I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum, cap sleeves, and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately, this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition, the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower, too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.
12385	This is a really pretty shirt - the colors are beautiful.  it runs large, and it's semi-sheer.  shape is loose and boxy, but because it's more sheer, it didn't seem as boxy.  i'm tall, and this was long enough.  only change would be to make the sleeves a little less bell like.  not tight, but lose some of the volume.
12386	I do a lot of online shopping and, consequently, a lot of returning. when i saw this shirt online i was really excited about it - it just looks very elegant, nice and airy. when the shirt arrived, i almost thought that i should return it, because there was blue lint all over the body and sleeves. turns out that this is part of the shirt; if you zoom in, you can see the blue specs woven in. i didn't end up returning the shirt, because it's extremely comfortable, and i still get a lot of complimen
12387	Really love the print of this dress and the eyelet detailing around the neck! very flattering!
12388	This shirt is beautiful. it is flowy and light, a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring. however, do not follow the washing instructions on the tag. it says you can machine wash, tumble dry low, and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low, it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it. it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again. if you do order, please take the
12389	"I love these pants. these pants are perfect if you like a slim style, but can't comfortably wear skinnies. i like the heavy weight corduroy fabric and seaming details. i bought the ""wine"" color, but as pictured, it really is rust or copper colored, which i prefer."
12390	I love wearing this pullover with leggings and boots. it's soft, comfortable, and loose fitting.
12391	
12392	The blue is not see though at all and the length is perfect. so many tops now are on the longer side or have the high/low hems. this one is great....love it. kinda want the white one now!
12393	This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy, loose-fitting tops, but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.
12394	Nicely made, pretty details, but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!
12395	Bought this shirt in the black. runs tts, very comfortable and flattering. past left of center shirts in this style/fabric seem to run a little large, but i bought this in my usual retailer m, and it's great. very similar to last years style, but perhaps a tad more fitted. i gave it a 4 for quality b/c i have noticed a little bit of pilling under the arm area, but overall, it holds up pretty well.
12396	"These pants have a really cute design. however, they are a bit short (and i'm only 5'4""). i'm still happy i purchased them, but i thought i was purchasing full length pants (as shown on the model) and not capris."
12397	"I am 5'3"", 118 lbs and fit perfect in size s petite. good material and flatting!"
12398	This is a gorgeous top; however, it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?
12399	Love this top! such a pretty color and so comfy. sleeves are a bit long, but fits pretty true, like most left of center. washes and dries in the dryer very nicely.
12400	I liked this shirt so much i ordered a second one online in the same size but different color. unfortunately the second one is much shorter than the first and looks less like a tunic or more like a cropped flowy top - not a good look. so the second one is going back. otherwise the shirt would get 5 stars. washes well, super soft and comfy, and looks great with all kinds of bottoms...jeans, cords, leggings. wish it came in more colors. i typically wear a m or l in retailer tops and took the l in th
12401	Perfect for the weekend, purchased the purple, it is a nice soft purple, great with jeans. xs petite was perfect. (115 lbs)
12402	Loved it. i have receive so many compliments when i wear this. it fit great.
12403	I ordered the orange version in size xl. it fits true to size. the fit on me matches the online photos. it's so comfortable to wear. i love the unique details of it. i've washed & air-dried it too. it retained its size. the color is outstanding. it's such a pretty shade that looks more red online than it does in person. there's more of a darker orange tint to it. i've gotten a lot of use out of this tee. hopefully it'll come back in the fall in more colors.
12404	I'm in love with this print! the fabric is very soft too. as others have noted it is small in some odd spots and a little big in others, but overall my usual size worked out great. i wear it with a cute belt to enhance an hourglass look, because it's pretty drapey. really versatile, lovely tunic.
12405	This top is a cross between a shirt and sweater. great length and very soft. it does run a little large so size down if you are n the fence. hangs nicely in the back.
12406	Was looking for a top with this style. i ordered this top wondering if it would fit in the hip area after reading the size chart (it showed a close fit.) the answer is yes! there's room to spare, which is a good thing. i like the nubby front material and the hemline's asymmetrical style. i'll be layering this top with sweaters and jackets all winter. very soft feeling fabric. wouldn't mind another one in a different color!
12407	I bought the grey, which is a gorgeous color. i like the long length in the arms (though i tried it on in different colors and the arm length did very). soft and pretty. i like the length. the back does wrinkle, but i still like the shirt. it's loose, casual and flattering.
12408	It's a little roomy, but this shirt is spectacular.  i've gotten so many compliments on this one, whether worn with jeans, work pants, or shorts.  all-weather.  as other reviewers have said, the material is sort of sleek-feeling - not traditional cotton.  for me, i love that, as i've been able to wash stains out of this shirt more easily than i otherwise would.  i am normally a tiny, tiny petite, but i ended up buying this in the xs regular because the style worked even though it's a bit loose.
12409	This top is great to wear to work or for enjoying brunch or dinner with friends. it is very comfortable and pairs great with jeans for a dressed down look. i sometimes wear it under a chambray dress and have gotten a ton of compliments. great purchase!
12410	This is a light, so fun to wear shirt. it's delicate and can be worn to dress up jeans. i would very much recommend it. love it!
12411	Ordered this online and thought it was more of a red than the true orange that it is
12412	I love this shirt. i have it in black and purple. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute long sleeve shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming. it is more fitted than last years style.
12413	I bought this shirt in black and green and now bought the orange. it is casual and stylish at the same time. material is soft. great shirt!
12414	"I was undecided whether to get regular or petite. i am 5'4"" but i didn't want it to be sloppy long. ordered the petite xs as other reviewers suggested ordering down and its perfect. length falls on me same as the model above. not heavy and very soft. casual but not sloppy. sleeves are a tad long which i prefer."
12415	I love a good white blouse and this shirt does not disappoint. the detailing of the lace and bead work make it extra special. i just love it. it can be dressed up or worn with jeans. it runs a bit wide. i normally don't buy a petite in tops because i am long in the body but i did with this one after i tried the regular.
12416	Love this top! the material is very comfortable and it's loose fitting which is what i was looking for!
12417	This is so comfortable, i had to buy another one. looks great under sleeveless sweaters. interesting texture adds interest.
12418	
12419	So this top is kind of short, but that is pictured. it hits right where it does in the photo, which i like. it is a sheer material, not terribly so, but you will most likely need a cami, which you could pair a long one with to offset the shorter top if you don't like the shortness. i love the top, it's very pretty detailing, cute, just as pictured. i ordered a size 2 and it fits great. i usually wear petites, but you really don't need to get a petite because it's short as it is. i have broad sho
12420	Love this, but the one thing that made me buy this is that if you look at the pic, the girl has her hand in a pocket - there is no pocket!!! which makes me bring the rating down - some one else had noted that the v is deep - they are very right - be prepared to shift the shirt lots unless you wear something under....... it is- other than that i really like it
12421	I ordered this shirt last week, and i wore it as soon as it arrived. it is a beautiful shirt with an original design. it is rather casual, but you can dress it up with the right accessories. the print appears to be navy (it was advertised as black), and it looks great with jeans. i would certainly recommend this item.
12422	Beautiful in white, and beautiful to look at, but as the other reviewer mentioned, the fabric is very sheer and see thru. not a deal breaker if worn over a cami; however, the reason i am returning it is the fit. there is too much fabric flaring right at my waist. it looks like a tent on me. in addition, some of the beading is already coming off, and i can't imagine what it will look like after one wash. that's too bad, but i can't justify paying this much money for a sweet top that is beautiful
12423	
12424	"This is a really great tunic. purchased it in black and it is very flattering. i love the side slit detail. the material may seem very casual, but it is extremely comfortable and can be dressed up. i'm 5'3"" 130lbs and a s fits perfect."
12425	I am not a big fan of lace but this shirt has just enough. it actually looks better than the photo and it looks even better when you wear it. i have received numerous compliments on this shirt everytime i've worn it.
12426	This blouse is made out of a high-quality material, flows beautifully, and the neutral flower pattern makes its yellow/green base pop. i played with a bow and decided that it looks the best tied lower than on the model to form v shaped neckline. this piece will transition easily from one season to the next and from causal to dressy. for the reference, size 12 was the best fit form my curvy 36dd frame.
12427	I love this top (so cute and comfy!), but i wore it twice, washed it once on gentle and layed to dry.....now there are 2 small holes in the front. for as much as it cost, i would have expected it to be more durable. very disappointing, especially since i don't live near an retailer and can't take it back easily......
12428	I was eyeing this blouse when the catelog was mailed to me earlier this year. i never got a chance to try it on in stores, but when i saw it online and on sale i snagged it. what i didn't realize was the intricate design of this blouse. ithas really pretty lace all over the top and then fine beading securely sewn on. the blouse has crochet sleeve designs and also a very pretty neck bib area. it fits me tts and very comfortably. i love the airy feeling of it and it actually also isn't too long on
12429	
12430	Love this sweater it's perfect for chilly florida evenings....love the loose boxy shape and it's very cozy not itchy!
12431	Luv the loose fit and quality fabric - great piece for layering.
12432	A must for every closet. very flattering fit - although i think the white is slightly boxier than the chambray.
12433	"I loved this shirt online and went to my local retailer store the other day and wanted to try it on. i didn't even get past the ""hold it up and measure the length"" test we tall people often do, as it was incredibly short. there is no way i could wear this shirt at 5'11"".   unless you have a short torso and want to rock the (icky) high-waisted pants that are everywhere right now, this beautiful top might not work for you.  oh, and it's sheer. camisole needed for white and navy."
12434	Super cute and flow. mine had a bit of stitching problem so i am exchanging it for the same thing. fabric feels great. def recommend
12435	A great everyday tee!! dress it up a bit with a great gold necklace!! looks nice with jeans and brown boots!!
12436	I love this sweater! i have gotten so many compliments. it is so comfortable and unique. i am planning on ordering the same sweater in another color. i wear a small and ordered a small. it fit me perfectly. i shop at retailer for a lot of my clothes because they are well made and different.
12437	This sweater is very cute! it looks great with a blouse underneath and open the zipper or it is great with a camisole. you will need something underneath especially if the temperatures are low as it is a wee bit shear. i am a small/medium ordinarily but it depends upon the designer. this runs a little large but keep that in mind if you plan on layering. the price is right and the zipper is aesthetically pleasing. i have the blue and oatmeal/beige color both are great pieces to any wardrobe.
12438	"I am 5' 4 1/2"", 125 lbs., and ordered a m in this. i'm usually between a s and m. it was too big and didn't have any shape to it. i don't think a s would fit much better. also, i ordered the pink but it was really a coral. if my local store had a s i would probably try it on in a different color, but they don't. i'll have to return this. it looks so cute online."
12439	I really like this sweater! it runs a little larger than expected, but i like my sweaters big. super, super comfortable and not itchy at all.
12440	Bells out to much i had to send it back
12441	Love these jeans! they fit great, they feel great. i am 5'9.5 135 pounds. they fit everywhere you would like them to. unroll them and they are long! love love love!! so wonderful i just bought my second pair.
12442	This cream sweater is a great addition to your wardrobe. the length hits below the waist and the zipper adds an updated touch to the look. is a bit itchy but there's room for a light layer underneath.
12443	I have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was 40% off. i ordered a size m petite, sadly when it arrived and i tried it on, it was very boxy, stiff like, and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back.
12444	I can only review the ivory as that was the only color in my local store. this sweater is very flattering as it is fitted on top but has a nice flow over the hips plus the zipper allows for more room or to show off an underlying top. the material is soft and the ivory is very pretty in person.
12445	I bought the ivory sweater. lovely color and softness. the zipper is a great, unique feature that i love. the bottom has a wavy shape with extra fabric - definitely creates a bell shape.
12446	"Just got these jeans last week. love the quality, which is typical of pilcro jeans. i usually have to get a tall size, being 5'10"", however they sold out quickly. so i decided to order the regular inseam in my usual size. they fit great. since they are more of a boyfriend jean, they don't fit too snug. so i'm able to get away with the regular inseam. i'm usually a 26-27 tall, and the 27 regular works. love the cuffs and rise in the jeans. i've worn with booties, heels...and am waiting for warm w"
12447	Absolutely stunning. the color, the pattern, the quality. i love everything about this top.
12448	Love the style of this sweater and it just happens to be warm, too!
12449	I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5'6 120 and usually a s fits. however, this was really tight. also, the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one.
12450	I love this top. it has a relaxed fit without being frumpy, and it looks great with boyfriend jeans or skinny jeans and boots. it's a great, soft fabric that doesn't require a cami underneath. wish there were other colors.
12451	"I was pleasantly surprised by this beautiful sweater! being that it's a wool blend, i thought it would be itchy against my skin. to my surprise, it is quite the opposite. very cozy and soft, with plenty of ""wiggle room"". i'm very tall and having enough length for my arms is always a concern. the sleeves are long and comfortable. this sweater is quickly becoming one of my new favorite ""go to"" pieces!"
12452	This top has great detailing and color. does run a little big, but adds to the style and movement of the tank. the stitching around the bottom makes it cute for layering.
12453	I hoped i would hate these because i have a zillion pairs of jeans. as i suspected, they're amazing and quickly became my favorite! they have just the right amount of stretch, so flattering.
12454	
12455	I remember the first time i walked into an retailer store: like walking into a dream of all my favorite things. i've finally found a store whose products help me to express myself. as a writer, i love whimsical & out of the ordinary. i have found my honey hole. every time one of the pastel bags w/ribbon handles is past over the counter or i push 'add to cart' on my computer, i do a little happy dance in my heart. my closet is like a candy store filled with sweets & treats. thank you retailerp
12456	I really love these jeans! they are so comfortable and are very flattering. i am 5'10 and a size 6. i bought the 28 regular and they fit perfectly. i have high hips, so i appreciate the mid rise in these. the length was perfect too, so i'm glad i did not purchase the tall. the length was the same on me as in the picture. the jeans arrived uncuffed, and they look just as cute without the cuff as they do with. i will definitely wear them with and without a cuff for different looks. i am very happy
12457	Runs very large. ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller
12458	I bought this sweater for my future daughter-in-law for her birthday in coral. she lover it! the contrast of color in the yarn is hard to see in the photos. grey and bright coral, just beautiful!
12459	I got this 25% off before christmas. i immediately started wearing it, thinking it would be a staple. i like the swing shape; the shape feels just right - not too baggy. but the material is more washed out looking than the picture reveals, collects lint like crazy, and out of the box the sweater looks like it has been laundered several times. also, there is a particularly prominent hole in the chest area (as you can see in retailer's picture). it looks out of place in person. i'm left loving the s
12460	Just received this top in the mail & purchased at the sale price. beautiful classic piece that can easily be dressed up or down. excellent quality & fits tts. for reference, i'm 5'5, 120lbs & ordered the sp & xs, i kept the xs. the sp had an elastic waist, there was no drawstring. not sure if this applies to all petite sizes or just the one i received.
12461	This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple, black, stylish.  unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off.  the upper arms, chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.
12462	"Let me preface this by saying, im totally keeping this dress!  it is kind of a weird design, but intriguing. i received it in the mail yesterday, i am 5'6"", 125 lbs and have hips. as a previous reviewer mentioned, this dress is more fitted than a swing dress as it appears. fortunately the xs fit me just right - but i cannot gain another lb.  my husband said that i looked like i was in a choir because of the higher neck design and bell sleeves, but he too found the dress somewhat alluring."
12463	"I second that above review who states ""worst blouse i've ever ordered"""
12464	When i saw this sweater online i honestly didn't think it was really anything special. however, when i saw it in my local retailer store i really liked the knit as well as the color (kind of an off white/ pinkish) i decided to give it a try. i have to say that i really like this sweater a lot. the cut is quite flattering even though it is baggy and it is very soft. i think it will look very cute with a pair of skinny jeans and boots this winter. glad i decided to give it a try.
12465	I have been looking for a vest this winter and i saw this one online. i am a huge fan of swing tops. i don't care for super fitted clothes. the knit says part wool so i was expecting it to be a little scratchier, however when i got it, it is so soft and more cotteny feel to it than wool but has the warmth of wool when wearing it. i really have to try not to wear it everyday. just love this vest! it's my favorite purchase this season. i am a size 10 in tops and i can either do a med or a large. i
12466	This sweater is so much better in person. it is a heavy, soft knit that fits perfectly.i am petite and thin and took the reg xs. it is very flattering and drops just below the hips. the bottom is a bit flowy. i bought the beige and bright pink color. the pink is very dark and bright and has an orangy tint to it. i wear a dark beige cami underneath. super cute with cuffed dark jeans and black booties.
12467	Love this sweater! bought it in pink and grey and it looks great with jeans. great quality and true to size.
12468	Great fit in waist, hips and butt. i wore them all day and they did not stretch out.  i am tall but the length of the jeans with the cuff is a tiny bit past my ankle bone. i want it just above the ankle bone so i am re-doing the cuff slightly and then i must send these to my tailor to close the cuff completely. they look silly when the big cuff isn't at least tacked in place. perhaps by design they were left this way so each of us buyers could find the proper length and close the cuff ourselves.
12469	Purchased this sweater in pink which is a beautiful blend of grey and pink. i purchased my usual size xs and it fits great through the shoulders, sleeves and body. i did try on a s and the body was too boxy. also, i tried a couple of different ones in my xs (along with other colors) and found them to run a little differently so you may want to check this out. the sweater is beautiful and easy to wear. the zipper adds a unique detail which can be unzipped part way to show a tank or just to draw a
12470	"Great jeans. especially since i'm getting tired of my skinny jeans. length is great for someone tall like me (5'10"") unless you wear heels with them but these are more sneaker/sandal jeans."
12471	The sweater looks cute if you get the right size. it meant to look a little oversized, i think. the color is pretty in person, however it looks different online and in person so keep that in mind. the material is very warm and a little itchy you will need to wear it over a long sleeve undershirt. the look is nice but it is for a cold day.
12472	I just ordered this item and wore it yesterday. received compliments from my friends. truly a great sweater. feels soft to the touch. i love the cut and how it falls around my hips. sleeves were nice and long. i am a tall lady with long arms. almost 6 ft, weighing about 155. i got the med which was a perfect fit for me. love the off white. almost thinking of getting the peachy pink too.
12473	I got an xs in this suit.  i am 5'1, 100#, a32.  this was much much too small.  it was very tight around the chest and i am only a 32a.  it is, however, a good looking suit.  i suggest sizing up.
12474	This sweater is really pretty. i love the way it looks on but it is a bit itchy and scratch if you don't wear something under it.
12475	The are so comfortable, flattering, and i feel i can wear them with a lot of styles: dress them up or down, it all looks good. great product! make more like this please!
12476	Ordered size 12, it fits but pulls a tiny bit in the midsection. also way too long, hits below my knees. the dress is beautiful: crisp black color, nice fabric, great neck. it's also the kind of dress that must fit well to look good. i had to return mine.
12477	Not flattering if your have large top. made well and very cute for thin no boob person
12478	The pictures of this sweater do not do it justice. i would have passed it over online but it immediately caught my eye in the store. the yarn is soft and cozy and the flair at the bottom adds a feminine touch. zipper is cute. v-neck is just right - it is not too low. i know i will be wearing this sweater a lot - very happy with this purchase! i didn't see the pink or navy in the store.
12479	On the real...i needed a sweater they gave my tummy some room! what yes i'd love some more pumpkin pie. know what im saying?! what appeared to be lack of constriction in the belly region of a tiny model, made me hope with fingers crossed it would look like that on me. please please just swing and not cling. mmmmm...k. the majority (70%) of the fabric content is natural and a sale was going on so i went for it and purchased this sweater online. so glad i did!
12480	This is a fun, cozy sweater. i feel you can dress it up and use it casual too. i bought the ivory in size s, i'm 5'2''. although i put it runs true to size, it's is a tad tight around my upper arms, not uncomfortable. i have normal to somewhat skinny arms, so i don't think it was my body type. i didn't check other sweaters in the same size to see if it was an isolated case. it is to be worn loose, it has quite a bit of material all around mid to lower part, just fyi.
12481	"Totally my style, i love how it hangs and is so soft and comfy. material is thin enough to be fairly lightweight, and i was worried about it being clingy -- so happy it's not! body skimming and very flattering for full bust (v-neck helps here) if like me you don't like tight chested clothing. also love the length of this top. i'm 5'4"" and 36ddd, size l fits me just how i like it."
12482	My normal size 30 in the hyphen chinos fits my size 10 body very well. these selvage jeans were too tight in the hips, too loose in the waist, and too tight in the knees, and i don't have big knees. also, the cuff was down to the floor instead of ankle length. cuffed, they seem to have a 32 inch inseam, and these were regular, not tall. basically, i think you need to have a straight up and down shape with no curves, and very long legs for this jean to work.
12483	"The sweater looked different on each model so i wasn't sure what to expect. luckily, it fitted me similar to the one i was hoping it would, the cream sweater model. i'm 5'6"" and got a size small. i like that it hangs just past my hips and the long sleeves. also, the v-neck isn't too low so i don't have to wear a camisole.it's very cozy and doesn't itch."
12484	This sweater runs a bit large/bulky around the bottom area. you can kind of see in picture. i purchased this online in medium as i'm 5'9 so normally wear that size. i could probably have ordered a small but will keep the medium, just a little too full around the hem. also, the v neck is somewhat low cut. pink color is nice and pale pink.
12485	I found this set once while browsing the website. i fell in love with it and kept a photo of the set so i could save up to purchase it. as luck would have it, my mom surprised me with a gift card, so i applied it to my purchase. i'm so happy with the set. it's wonderfully flattering, and makes me feel sexy. i want one in every color!
12486	Great sweater - heavy without being too warm. great layering piece.
12487	Hard to find longer shorts that i like. these are really cute. i thought from the pictures that the backside would be faded and lighter which i wasn't thrilled about, but willing to order and give a try. great to discover this is not the case- nice regular color on back and no fading. really cute shorts.
12488	
12489	This sweater is heavier and has more of a swing shape to it than i had expected. but it is fitted enough at the top, that it still fit the bill. the pink is woven with a taupey color, and the effect is great. almost a little retro.
12490	Recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling
12491	I usually wear small, ordered xs and it's still way too large. quality not that great, just meh, returning it.
12492	When i wore this dress i got tons of compliments! the quality is great along with the style.
12493	"I think these jeans are good for people with long lean legs. i'm 5'7"" 155 lbs and the wide cuff made my legs look short and stubby. the weight of the jeans is a little on the heavier side - i usually like soft denim. i usually wear a 31 and thought they were true to size."
12494	I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall, in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow, the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed, the sweater doesn't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn't flattering. i have a small build, and, frankly, i usually look good in sweaters
12495	These jeans are perfect in every way. i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos. they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them. i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on. they look great - highly recommend.
12496	I have a hard time finding jeans that fit and these ones are just right! i am 5'8, 125ish lbs and the 26s fix perfectly; they hug in all the right places and they are the perfect length. i will be wearing them uncuffed. there is no effort required to uncuff them, they're not sewn or anything. they have just the right amount of stretch and love the little cute details throughout them. thank you, retailer, for always helping me find great jeans!
12497	After reading other reviews i ordered a small. my usual size is a m. it was huge all around. it's a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top.
12498	Love these jeans, comfortable fit and material is soft.. fit true to size and have a good rise.
12499	"I think this sweater is well executed for what it is--a chunky knit trapeze sweater. i agree with another reviewer that i would ignore this product online, but it caught my eye in person. there was only one of the pink sweaters left in store. the interwoven peachy, heathery color is sweet and flattering. since i'm 5'1"", i ordered had the petite version to try. hope it works out 'cuz i'm eager to own something relaxed and cozy that's actually flattering and isn't a sweatshirt."
