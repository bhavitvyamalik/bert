3200	"I loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my 5'8"" frame. wish it came in a tall size!"
3201	Super cute top! thin!! would look great layered! not crazy how it looked by itself!
3202	I worse this dress to a rehersal dinner and received so many compliments. it was a perfect summer dress.. the colors are true to the picture and beautifil. it is also very well made, comfortable and flattering. i am 5'3' and 130 lbs and i ordered a medium petitte which fit great. it was short but not too short! it will be a go-to dress!
3203	This is a really cute top. yes, it is dry clean only but i plan on hand washing it. one negative is that it is extremely short in length. i'm 5 feet tall and this top barely goes past my bellybutton. it's extremely soft though and definitely different.
3204	Remember those cable-knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties?! that's exactly what this sweater is. everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere. i'll pass on this!
3205	These are nice and light weight and comfortable
3206	"Love the unique look of this coat. living in the northeast, during cold weather i wanted something warm that wasn't your run-of-the-mill wool coat. i agree with the other reviews about the somewhat ""bulky"" nature of the coat, but i'm not wearing a coat of this nature to look thin. i'm fairly thin, 5'4"" 102, i know i'm not bulky, so i didn't care if the coat made me ""look heavier"" than i am, it's a winter coat, get over yourself, no one really cares how much you weigh. so, if you can get past tha"
3207	This is a cute casual dress that could be worn with flip flops or boots.
3208	I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves, but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall, it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.
3209	I love these pants, i actually bought them twice! the special dye in them did not agree with my detergent so i bought another pair on sale.....some woolite and will wash them inside out/hang to dry. will take better care of my second pair.
3210	
3211	"Oh my god - i love this skirt. i first order the size 4 and immediately called customer service and had them send me a 2. i found it be be both plenty stretchy (great for moving, sitting, etc) but runs on the large size. but the fit is amazing. i love the length - a perfect knee-skimmer for me (5'9""). i love the color (green) and the pockets and button fly are so fun without being too much! i've tried it on with several tops and sweaters in my closet and this skirt is going to be one that i can"
3212	I absolutely love this top!! i bought the ivory color, and i am definitely considering buying the black as well! it feels true to size, but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy. i can't wait to wear this top all season long!
3213	I tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 (a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea). the 4 fit in the outer layer, however as the previous poster mentioned, the lining is super tight. i couldn't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips. the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining. not sure what when wrong here but it's a shame because it's a really cute dress.
3214	This one will be going back. the color is really blah and the fabric wasn't a texture i was expecting--it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day. overall, the cut and style is cute, but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style. this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric.
3215	"I really love this piece. it's so different from anything else i own! the material has a lot of fine details to it that are hard to see in the photos. easy to dress up with a bit of jewelry and heels. the only downside is the upper body fit. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs with more of an hourglass shape. i did not fill out the top at all, although the shorts fit fine around my waist."
3216	"These cords are great--lightweight for fl winters, and the bootcut flare bottom is super cute with ballet flats or booties. i am 5'10"" and typically a size 8; the size 29 fit perfectly. they have a little stretch to them, which is great. very flattering--wish i could order in more colors!!"
3217	Great chinos, but they run a size large. i ordered my normal pants size and had to return them for one size down. i actually like them so much after finding the right size, i bought a second pair in store. i have the grey and mustard yellow. love them! just order a size down!
3218	"I was worried about ordering this top after the first review, but i was very pleasantly surprised. the sweater is a nice weight on the front panel, and a lighter weight knit on the back panel, which gives it a ""flowy"" quality. it looks slender and trim in front, with the unexpected surprise in back. the transition between the front and back panels is well done, which doesn't really show in the photos. i purchased the yellow sweater and had many compliments on it's uniqueness the first time i wor"
3219	"Think price convinced me to put this in my bag ... the oops of on line shopping i guess. the strip and 'stitch' like snowflake is just not me. a little too ""cutesy' for me. if strip alone might have kept .. but this is just too much, not my style .. back it goes."
3220	I waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away. i am disappointed!!! the lace fabric is very stiff. i should have listened to the previous reviewer. i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck. although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress, had the fabric been different, i think it would be a great dress.
3221	Bought this top for date night -- something a little special. it's that and also very comfortable. i have broad shoulders and this style accommodates. easy to dress up or down -- perfect!
3222	Get creative with the neckline or let it fall where ever. this is a purposefully slouchy, uber casual, super soft
3223	This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple, black, stylish.  unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off.  the upper arms, chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.
3224	I got this dress in coral and i absolutely fell in love with it the moment i tried it on. the fabric is very soft and flows nicely. i am 5'3 and i got it in regular but the length is not too long or short. i can probably wear it with my flip flops.
3225	Picked this up at the local retailer in both colors. the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan - which i also bought. highly recommend.
3226	"I have received so many compliments on this top. it really looks exactly like it does on the model, and i'm not as thin as she is. i am 5'5"" and 134 lbs,, small on top, and bought the small in this top. the v-neck is very flattering and is hangs so nicely that it does not make me look hippy. looks great from all views. i paired it with white pencil pants and wedge heels. also, the black lace detail down the sides looked great when i paired it with black yoga pants and flip flops. the colors are"
3227	"Gorgeous flowy dress that's great for three seasons. thank you to the previous reviewers for the fit advice. size small was only available and it fits perfectly on me (i'm an m/l on top). i'm short and will have to hem because even with 3"" heels i kept stepping on the back skirt. bodice opening is wide and gapes too much so i will wear a cami bra or fashion tape or have an additional fastener sewn in. there are bright little balls of red trim and unexpected pops of violet embroidery, adding to t"
3228	So unflattering! really disappointed. made me look 6 month pregnant and i'm a petite size 2.
3229	I really love this top, great colors, comfortable, long enough (always a problem for me), light but feels quality fabric and nice details.
3230	This is such a fun dress to wear. i wanted something comfortable and flirty and this checked off both boxes. im typically a small size 6 but went w x-small on this one to hug the shoulders more.
3231	I usually wear a s. the reviews were helpful. looking at the pic this shirt does look a little on the fitted side. i ordered a size m & it fits perfectly! the sleeve length is fine too! the colors are dark, not as in the photo. i do like the frayed edge look too. i have some skinnys like that. i had been looking at this shirt for months but thought it was a bit pricey. at the sale price plus the promo discount it makes it very much worth it. no regrets. hope this isn't tmi.. of note: the dark bl
3232	"I purchased this dress in my regular size xs. i'd come across it several times at my local store but never thought much of it to try it on. . when i saw it was on sale i decided to take a chance. boy was i surprised. the dress is really beautiful.. the hints of gold reflect nicely.. the dress is comfortable and loose yet flattering. i received so many compliments on it. i am 5'1"" and the regular length worked for me."
3233	"This is a great long sleeve, casual shirt for spring - soft and airy. pairs well with jeans. i found that it fit me just right. i'm not very tall, but my shoulders are a little broad for my height, which typically puts me in the ""small/medium"" range, so i got size 6 regular. this hits just below the hip and the shoulders are spot on. very flattering yolk that gives a little contour to the bust. gauzy fabric has wrinkled texture which gives it a casual look and feel. my only problem is there aren"
3234	This was really billowy but not in a good way. i had to return it. looks great in the photo but not so much in person.
3235	I bought this to use over the holidays. it is extremely comfortable and i've received multiple complements. you can dress it up or wear it casual.
3236	Perfect fit. though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami. i absolutely recommend this shirt. it fits tts.
3237	I love this skirt! i know others have thought it frumpy, maybe it's because i'm so long waisted but this skirt is perfect for me! not too long not too short but just right! the fabric print is beautiful a mix of muted and bright colors. the fabric quality is nice but nothing overly outstanding. still i'm glad i ordered it before it was gone!
3238	I bought the white tee. while the print is nice, the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).
3239	I splurged on this dress when it was first in stock a year ago and haven't regretted it for a minute. it is my go to dress for work, cocktails, and once, two weddings in one day! the print is gorgeous and the fabric is super comfortable. i love twirling in it as the dress has just enough stretch with a little flounce. the length is ladylike and the sleeves provide perfect coverage for my arms. the seam between the bodice and the skirt hits right at your natural waist and the look really flatters
3240	I was immediately drawn to this stunning blouse ( in pink) in the store. it is a fabulous silk and velvet just in time for the holidays and beyond. in true floreat style it is well made and unique.  i'd say it fits tts to maybe slightly small if you want it to fit like it does on the model. i usually buy petite sizes when available but went with regular sizing as that is what was in the store and i liked the fit.
3241	The jacket was nice and soft but it was too short on my torso with a cropped fit which i'm not a fan of that style. i returned it.
3242	Online photos do not do this skirt any justice i agree with a previous poster. i normally never buy anything brown, but there are pops of teal and magenta throughout. you can't see the gorgeous shimmer and the interesting layered colors online. in addition, this skirt has a stretch waistband (plus for the holidays!) and is so flattering, not too tight, but shows just enough of your curves, physique. i like that the skirt is longer as well - will look cute with boots. i purchased the size medium
3243	"This is a great dress - it definitely runs true to size and is on the border of running a little small. if you're on the fence about which size to order go with the larger size. the fabric moves nicely but wrinkles easily when packed. love the color. got a ton of compliments :)"
3244	Unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle). also, there are no bra-straps holders, and my bra straps did show up a lot...
3245	
3246	More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid
3247	"Adorable & comfortable. i'm 5'3"", 115 lbs, and ordered an xs."
3248	I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.
3249	"I've been searching for a pretty & soft faux fur coat - finally found it hanging there in retailer! there was only one - a size small. it looked gorgeous, but thought i could use it a bit roomier. i'm a size 2/4, 5'5"" & about 118 lbs. i ordered a medium but it was huge. stayed with the small and am loving wearing this in our mild northeast winter. lots of compliments. lightweight and luxe. get it."
3250	I ordered a size down as the reviews suggested and i love them!! they are so cute and snug enough in the calf that i can wear boots with them in winter.  great buy!
3251	"Very pretty blouse. it does run quite large, i am usually an xs-s or 0-4 and purchased the 0. i could probably have gone to a 00. for reference i am 5'4"" 118 lbs 34b/c. it says that it is dry clean only, however i washed in in delicate cycle with cold water and threw in the dryer for a little bit. it came out perfect! i was hoping to shrink it and it only shrunk a tiny bit. i was hoping for it to shrink more but it is fine. no need to even iron it! i was lucky enough to get it on sale, i don't t"
3252	I love everything about this tunic dress. it's versatile and can be styled a few ways: loose like a shift, blouson when cinched, or eliminate the liner and wear as a layer over whatever you want. all the little details make it stand out and give it a glamorous bohemian vibe. there are tiny beads, sequins and subtle micro pleating. the fabric is airy and quite delicate (be careful.) the drawstrings at the waist are adjustable for both sides. slip is tts and the outer dress has a subtle oversize d
3253	"I agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that it's a much lovelier color in person, but that's about it for me. thoughts below: _____________ pros: - tts. i ordered the medium for my 36c, 5'9"" frame and found it sufficient. - the color is much nicer in person, as the other reviewer mentioned. it's a richer brown. think ""mocha latte"" in terms of color. - the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it"
3254	Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather.
3255	"I purchased this dress in blue and paired it with the seychelles forward platform wedges in cognac. the fit is amazing, the length is great (i'm 5'5"" and it hits me a couple inches above the knee), and it is a great spring staple. my only issue with this dress is that is wrinkles so easily. easily fixed with a quick steam or low iron."
3256	Despite being a knit, this skirt holds its shape and is absolutely perfect. it goes with everything and is extremely comfortable.
3257	I love this shirt. it would be a fairly basic tee but the neckline makes it fun. it's very soft and comfortable. i bought the white with blue pattern and will probably purchase additional colors.
3258	
3259	Love this shirt, bought this shirt, returning this shirt. believe this and the other reviewers who say it runs small, especially through the bust, and even if you're not busty. it's now sold out in my size, wish i'd gotten a bigger size that i could keep!
3260	"I love this top. the fabric is soft and a silky lightweight - perfect for summer. i feel it runs a size large. i'm 5'4"", 130lbs, with broad shoulders. i usually wear a medium, but a small fit perfectly."
3261	I put this runs small but it's a little more tts, except the arms are very slim! if you like to push your sleeves up like this model, you will have to wait for a while to see if the sweater loosens up. length wise it fit me a bit longer than this model and i'm a petite. the color is also darker and not as red as in this sweaters, which i actually prefer. the sweater is much thicker than my other cashmere sweaters. some of the stitching seems stick out as if the sweater is worn inside out, but th
3262	I love this tshirt, but the speckled grey looks more like roof shingles in person. i'm going to try to exchange it for a different color.
3263	Love these. wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots. nice subtle print. i think they run about 1 size small. i'm normally a size 0/25. the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled. size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough. incidentally, i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too. love love
3264	"This shirt is stunning- definitely a shirt for special occasions. it's more than i would normally pay for a top, but it is a really special piece of clothing. the fit is slim- i'm 5'6"" and 118 pounds. i typically wear an xxs or xs in retailer clothes. the xxs is just right. it is quite sheer, so i imagine i will wear a nude tank top underneath."
3265	I so badly wanted this dress to work for me. the material and color is so beautiful. this had a 'sack like' fit and the side pockets accentuated my hips giving me a broader look than i would like.
3266	As other reviewers have pointed out, this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight, and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve, but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.
3267	I loved this shirt online but when it came to my house i loved it even more. super comfy and really flattering! i love it!!! runs true to size!
3268	"I had a hard time deciding to order red or turquoise, as both colors are really nice in person. the black, of course, is a classic. another reviewer found the top to be small, but i found it to be a little big on me in my usual size. not too bad, but a little bigger than expected.  teh neck part is effortless as there is stiching to help the colw effect stay in place. the fabric is thin though, so may show things (thinking bra ripples, and perhaps some other ripples in front tummmy). keeping it"
3269	The melon color is soft and flattering. it is a little on the long side in the back, but i paired it with a lightweight, flowy sweater, and received compliments.
3270	As others have said, this is cropped, so will look funny with most pants that aren't high waisted. i'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it. the lining is adorable, so i don't want to have to send it back.
3271	This cute top fits great. it's got a nice fit on arms, shoulders, and bust, then flares out a bit to give ease to the tummy area. the back has a cute button trim and solid blue inset. cute top!
3272	Love this top. have two of them. they are comfy, light-weight and extremely flattering. love!
3273	Beautiful dress. i just wore this dress for my wedding. it was a beautiful wedding dress and i got many compliments on the uniqueness and the beading detail. there was one really big problem. the beads and the flowers kept falling off. i sat down and stood up leaving a pile of little flowers and beads. i could be standing still and they would periodically drop off. it was kind of embarrassing and everyone remarked that i was my own flower girl. i am still finding pieces of the dress everywhere.
3274	I'm an hourglass shape and on me this dress didn't give me any shape at all. and i felt the bell sleeves were a little much. the lining though is really soft and excellent for colder weather. and the print is very pretty, just as pictured.
3275	I had been eyeing this top for a while so i was so happy to see it go on sale! i was so excited that i went to my local retailer to try to purchase it right away. unfortunately this top did not fit me right. on the model it looks adorable, on me it was frumpy & ugly. the petite is sold out so i tried a regular medium (i'm usually in-between a medium & a large) & it fit me big & just didn't do anything to my figure. i agree with the other reviewers that the bow was too thin & flimsy & needed to be
3276	A romantic find. light and airy. the color is slightly darker than shown. the soft, subtle ruffles give it just the right touch.
3277	I bought this skirt in the store a few months ago, because i anticipated that retailer would sell out of my size considering how great the fit/look of this skirt is. sure enough, they've sold out of the size 2. normally i wear a size 4, sometimes 6, in skirts depending on the cut and where it's from; just last year i bought a skirt from retailer in a size 10! for me, this was a skirt i needed to try on to get the perfect size, but it's absolutely adorable and a great deal at the sale price! it's mod
3278	I'm super into this top! i bought the evergreen color in store as it fit true to size and was very flattering. i went to buy an item that was available online only and decided to also buy this top in black. my favorite aspect about this shirt is that it can be dressed up or down. the material is slightly stretchy though it does not cling. i can wear a chunky necklace and dressy skinny pants and look ready for a nice dinner. on the other hand, this top can be thrown on with a pair of comfy jeans
3279	What a wonderful find! yes, it runs big. .. and beautiful! love the quality, and design. very light and airy. this is great for me because i'm not short & i am busty & i love tunics. this item can be dressed up or played down with class. the lining is a perfect complement to the tunic as well and fits nice with the garment. i am usually to busy to write a review, but i felt obligated on this item. five stars!
3280	I am 5.1 and 113lbs. i ordered the petite size 26 and it fits like a glove. i gave 4 starts as i wish i had less stretch in it but other than that they are perfect length and sooo soft. super happy with the cut and waist height!
3281	It is very comfortable and the fabric is amazing. it runs a little short on me because i have a long torso, but it works great with a tank underneath. love it!
3282	I love it! the fit is very flattering. i read in another review that the top runs small, so i got a small instead of an extra small and it fits perfectly.
3283	I know this is supposed to be a loose, flowy fit which is exactly the style i love. however, this is beyond tent-like. i'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small. fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper. huge bummer, especially after seeing a few 5-stars.
3284	So nice. lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs. will look stylish on all heights. very impressed with the styling and construction. fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage.
3285	This jacket is perfect! the crop length is just right! not to short and the way it is cut longer in the back it really paints a beautiful silhouette on my larger frame. i'm a a 12 typically but broad in the shoulders and larger in the bust 36dd. this jacket is loose fitting and roomy. i could probably have gone with a large, but i'm really happy with the xl as i can layer underneath and it's just super roomy and comfy. the quality of this jacket is great. it will be a staple for years to come. i
3286	This is my 6th pair of rockets. they've become my hands down, favorite cut from citizens. for curvy girls, these are the perfect skinny jeans. they come up high enough to tuck everything in, no muffins top. they shape and lift my butt, which i need because i've got a generous one. they hold their shape amazingly well and don't require a wash with every wear in order to regain their shape. they truly have been the holy grail of jeans, for me. with all that said, these are not a 5 star version of
3287	I have a number of sweaters from moth, and they never disappoint. the ones made with this ultra soft and warm yarn are my favorite. i bought both colors :) i wear it with jeans or dressier clothes-- i'd say it's very versatile.
3288	Very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall, 120 lbs. i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top.. sadly returned the top. otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric.
3289	I love retailer sweaters! always great quality and design, this one is no exception. i have the navy blue one and it fits well, true to size.
3290	"These pants are my new ""go to"" . i am 5'6"" 122# and the 25 fits perfectly. they do give a little.   lots of colors to choose from. i have the washed blue and am thinking i need to get more colors!"
3291	I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately, some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost, this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.
3292	"I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it! the fabric is a great weight- flowy, but still substantial enough. with nude undergarments, i can't see anything. in fact, that is one of the things i love; no special undergarments are required, so it is very comfortable and still very flattering. i typically wear a medium- 135 pounds, 5'4"", 34b, 28 waist, 40 hip. i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big. i would have bought it, but the salesperson suggested i try"
3293	"The black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful. the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color. it simply did not match. it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color. the fit was ""ok"". just didn't love it."
3294	I love this tank. super soft and comfy. i wear with leggings, jeans, shorts- anything. longer in the back so will cover your butt- at least it covered mine. runs slightly oversized. love the asymmetry in the front- very flattering. very happy with it.
3295	I thought it was going to be so pretty. it is ugly on. the macrame is thick, stiff and rough. the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless. yuk!
3296	In retailer's defense, silk chiffon in general is super fragile. got the top in turquoise and the color and design are beautiful!! i'm 5'3 117 lbs and took an xs, fits true to size. i'm able to wear a nude strapless bra with the top and looks great. i have worn the top a couple of times and by the end of the day i had a few snags. i was able to pull the thread back inside the top, never ever cut silk chiffon. i love the top so much, i bought a second one in the same color and size as a back up. un
3297	Unfortunately, does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it.
3298	"This dress is fantastic! it's super flattering and very versatile. for reference, i am 5'4"" and 155 lbs, and usually a size 8 - 10 in retailer dresses. the size medium fit perfectly. highly recommend this item!"
3299	
3300	"The fabric, so diaphanous! so flowy! the pattern, so pretty with such interesting colors. it could literally go with anything! purple, yellow, orange, green, they're all in there. but here's the but....  i have no waist! and when you put this type of empire silhouette on me, i look like i'm wearing a sack, or i have some pregnancy news--when i don't. i tried belting it : waist tie is too high; i tried putting on a vest, too annie hall and called too much attention to the sleeves, while adding"
3301	"I ordered this piece online and returned it at the store a few days after arrival. the material is very soft and well made. however it is not flattering on the hourglass or pear shaped person. moreover, if you are short, the design may make you look shorter. i am 5'4"" and it did to me. the design is beautiful. if you are tall and have narrow hips, this is the piece for you. i am 5'4"", 160lbs and usually wear a s/m."
3302	"Tried and pictured the regular size small. my stats are 34/35a-28-36 and i usually wear a 6 or an 8 on top in shirts and blazers. the small here was nicely loose so it might run a bit big. in person, the colors are dark navy on light beige. lovely heavy weight cotton and stitching. i think it's deliberately a bit short, hit at my hip (i'm 5'6"") but i like this. the 3/4"" sleeves are a bit nowhere for me...i wish they were full length but that's my only quibble."
3303	"Love this little number. very flattering, warm, and soft. color goes with everything, i tried it on with a slip dress, and it added class and warmth... big button details are fun well-made and beautiful cut. i ordered xxs petite, and it fit like a glove, with room for something underneath if needed. i also ordered te xs petite, as my stylist was afraid xxs would be small, but will keep xxs p after actually trying it on. 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist."
3304	"I love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended. not so. for starters the top is much more of a beige in person. a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully. secondly there is just so. much. fabric. it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like i've tried to hard to make it ""work"", lastly the"
3305	"I went to my local retailer store on saturday to pick up some new cute things that i had my eye on. after collecting the items i came in for i saw this romper! i tried it on and it was 'amazing""  comfortable , soft and so versatile!!! bonus!!! i left so tremendously happy!! it will be a win for  many years to come!!!!!!!!!!!"
3306	I absolutely love this top. i'm always either an x-small or 0/2 in mauve. i think this top runs small. i tried on an extra small and it was too tight in the chest. i'm average in bust.
3307	Quirky tunic length top. has a windowpane print on the inside and the grey plaid looks like flannel but is cotton. the red burgandy embroidery adds punch and it has a boho flair. size down one size runs big.
3308	This is a great, casual top that can work in all seasons. i love it with skinny pants/jeans.
3309	This dress is a work of art both online and in person. the color is more vibrant in person and both colors are beautiful. i like the mango color better because it looks better on my olive skin tone, plus i like the purple flowers against the orange background. thank goodness for the liner because this dress is very thin. it wrinkles easily but i think it comes with the territory due to the thin silk fabric. for short gals like me, a belt is a must for a structured look if worn with heels; otherw
3310	These bottoms are very cute but defiantly cheeky! i would recommend sizing up if you want to have more coverage.
3311	I wasn't sure how to rate the fit on these. i tried my normal 12 and the waist fit pretty well- but there's a lot of room in the hip/pelvis area. i tried a 10 but the waist didn't fit. i can see these gathering when i sit- but i just love the print. there is no stretch in these, either. i have slim legs- if you don't, i would size up or just pass. the calf is tight.
3312	I first saw this shirt on one of the workers at the retailer stores and it looked beautiful. i loved it so much i had to order it when it came on sale. the fit is a little too short for my liking, but i think i can make it work. also, it does fit a little snug around the arms but it at least it doesn't show your undergarments. overall, i think it is absolutely beautiful. the fabric has a beautiful shimmer to it and it looks easy to dress up for a day at the office or a night on the town, or paired
3313	I bought this in rose and i really like the jacket. the color is not rose but the picture is accurate. it is more terra cotta as previous reviewer's said. it is pretty casual but you can dress it up with a chunky necklace and dressy boots. i do wish it was a tad more fitted in the waist. i think it looks better buttoned, but i do wear it open as well.
3314	This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium
3315	
3316	These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for, and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim, but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse, but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants.
3317	It is a little pricey for what it is, but i love it so much that i am keeping it. i am normally size 4-6 and the s fits great. the rope straps are just adorable!
3318	
3319	"It's ok, fit doesn't wow me because of my body. chest is too wide, hips look too narrow. drapes across my back fat in an especially non-flattering way. basically made my square-apple body look more square-apple. great part about this dress is that it's comfy and hides the tummy pooch. construction is poorly done...contrasting liner at v-neck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally. another negative point is dry clean only. boo. i'm 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 an"
3320	"I opened the package and loved this skirt immediately. i held it up and the waist is tiny. i'm usually a size 6 but sometimes go for a size 8 at retailer (i'm 5'6"" and 126 lbs). i would have needed at least 4 extra inches in the waist band to close the zipper...i wonder if this is a british size 8 or something. this 8 is closer to a 4. really disappointed."
3321	
3322	I really like this romper and i ordered it to fit my bottom. i'm a 6 on the bottom and 4 up top. i ordered a mp to cover the bottom and a petite for my height. it's a keeper but i will be belting or adding something to cinch it at the waist so that it has more of a shape.
3323	"I have worn this with skinny jeans and espadrilles untucked and with black linen shorts. i also wore tucked in with high waisted slim fit black pants,  i got compliments on all the looks. i think it's a fun and cheerful, feminine summer top.  i got mine on sale so i thought was a fair price for what it is. wouldn't have paid full retail.  requires ironing.  i am a size 4 and 5'3 and have a small."
3324	I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable. however, while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist. i will acknowledge i'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs, but was hopeful these pants wouldn't cling to them. for reference, i'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants.
3325	I love the look of this garment. from the color to the detailed design, it is just awesome looking. i tried this in 3 sizes: 2regular, 2petite, and 0 regular. i often order petite pants and they work, but for this item the crotch was too high for me to wear a petite size, and the legs were short enough to look awkward. i returned it for the 0 regular which fit me best - i'm 5'5, 110 lbs. i haven't worn it out yet, but am excited to wear it to a couple weddings this season. one fallback is that i
3326	I'm 5'9 and wear a size 12. this dress runs tts though there is no stretch to it, found the bust to be a tad tight (38c). it is light with good movement. i did not find it short waisted and i thought the proportions were correct. the length was just long enough to make me feel comfortable wearing it. i'm looking forward to wearing it to holiday dinners this season.
3327	I purchased the black tunic. as others have mentioned, this piece goes great with skinny jeans or leggings. when i'm rushing to find something to wear, this is one of my go-to's. nice coverage. not see-through.
3328	I made the mistake of ordering a medium instead of large and have the same fit issues as other reviewers. it is tight in the back through the shoulders, so if you're considering it i would stick with your larger of your size range. the print is beautiful as is the fabric. it looked okay on me from the side but i am short waisted. it fell at the perfect length on me too. there's just something about the fit that didn't wow me so i don't plan to reorder, but i do think it would be lovely on thinne
3329	There's a free people version of this top and this by far surpasses the fit of it. i'm 5'3 and purchased the xl and it fits me exactly like the model. i would say it is tts and extremely soft.
3330	I purchased the orange tiger print and absolutely love it! the colors and pattern are rich and vibrant and can easily be dressed up to be worn for work or a night out!
3331	This is my second pair of pilcro jeans and the second time i am totally impressed. these jeans have a comfortable stretch and rugged wash that is trendy & fun. they are the perfect everyday jean and look great casually with a pair of birkenstocks or converse low tops. the only thing worth pointing out is that i am pretty short (5'4) and the regular length fits me perfectly. this may be an issue for ladies lucky enough to have some extra inches on me.
3332	Beautifully made, designer sweater. and it's soft and comfortable. i decided to return because it's just too much for my body.  the fringe, which is quite long, overwhelmed my shape and i looked much larger than i am. the color is true white. the knit itself is fuzzy. it closes with a single button on the placket at the neckline. although not for me, i do recommend.
3333	I love these jeans! perfect amount of stretch without sag. great color.  ordered my usual size 28. i wish they had these in olive and black!
3334	"This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb, 5'-4"", 36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern, color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent, lol. also, the back is slightly longer than the front, something i couldnt see from the pictures online."
3335	I came to retailer just to browse and came across this dress. i almost didn't get it because it looked very big. however, i tried it on, and fell in love with it. it does run a little wide, but the length is good, and it is very comfortable. it is perfect for the summer months.
3336	Great dress, received tons of compliments. downside to the dress is it stretched a bit and was feeling a bit loose by the end of the evening.
3337	This dress is a bit longer than photographed but i was totally ok with that. the skirt is also a bit fuller which makes the dress more formal. it's really well made and great material. i'm 5'6 123lb and bought a size 4.
3338	First off, i love the dress! i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in 20 minutes. the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a d+cup. i ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly except in the bust. easy fix, a white cami, the sale price makes that necessity acceptable. it's a keeper.
3339	
3340	I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!
3341	Love cloth and stone. this dress looks and fits exactly as pictured. soft and casual, with great design details.
3342	I really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly can't now. i was attracted to the softness, simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it. wrinkles, pills and loses shape quickly. if you still want to get it, consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you. this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size. the styling is excellent--very versatile. but the yarn is too delicate and fussy.
3343	Great weekend toss around piece or with gym clothes.  the cut is flattering, yet not tight.  i purchased in 2 colos  b/c i liked it so much and was looking for a piece like this for a very long time! cute with yoga legging, jeans, sweats etc.
3344	This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on, it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side, gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also, it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.
3345	This lovely skirt absolutely hits the mark for quality. it is a substantial weight for fall, a deep vivid blue color, and just the right length to wear with boots.  it was a trifle snug in the waist. i would have kept it anyway, but the oversized pockets stuck out on either side in an awkward way.  at this price, it just wasn't right for me.
3346	But the back of it, by the waist, bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger, it will be too long. but i love the skirt, it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured, just below the knee in front. the waist is snug, bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier. (115 lbs, 26-27 in waist, short legs...)
3347	You know how you look in your closet and things just say i'm perfect for today. this top is like that. i got it a few weeks ago and have worn it often because it is so easy and hangs really nice. i bought the black one and am considering the off white one.
3348	This dress is absolutely beautiful! and, had it been just a little longer or a little shorter i would have kept it. but, the hem hit me at just the wrong spot! alas, i had to send it back :(
3349	The blouse is gorgeous. the detail to the blouse is outstanding and it is very feminine. from the pictures, front and back, there appears to be flow to it and room. however, my general size m was absolutely gigantic. it was like a tent. i was speechless when i looked in the mirror. i debated tapering it and then thought that's just too much effort. i'm going to return and see if i can order in 2 sizes smaller. i'm 5'1 and a 36c, if this helps.
3350	I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.
3351	When this piece arrived, i was surprised at how weightless it was. there are 2 layers to it, an underlayer and then a very fine silk toplayer together, the ensemble is incredibly light and it is almost as though i feel like i am not wearing anything at all. to take it home, i did have to kind of stuff it in my bag, and this caused some considerable wrinkles which are very difficult to get out (super stubborn( but i am pleased with the look of the garment. usually, i like the look of a dress that
3352	I bought this dress in store today in a size 4, i usually wear an 8 (so i was thrilled) the print and details are gorgeous but it's a very wide swing dress, there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist. i'm going to wear this with a belt so it's fine but the images online are a little misleading.
3353	"I went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress, and i'm so glad i did. the fit was perfect. i'm always a little hesitant about long dresses since i'm 5'2"", but the petite length was perfect. the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable, but i feel elegant in it. i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month."
3354	Love the design and the gold color, but the seams between knit and lace were a little weird and bunched/weren't smooth. maybe the one i tried on just needed to be ironed or something...
3355	"The design and fabric on this suit are even more gorgeous in person than on-line. i am 5'4"" and between 138/140 and ordered a medium. the thing i especially like about this suit is that it has adequate cup size and support. i am a 36c or d depending on the bra and this suit is very flattering and provides nice coverage and cup support. the straps can be shortened if you want a little more bust support. the material and design of the suit itself feel substantial and even without the straps, it do"
3356	This dress is beautiful. swingy and fun, and the floral pattern is just stunning for fall and winter. i am planning on wearing it with black tights and ankle booties. could be dressed up or down- very versitle. fits my tall curvy frame perfectly. love.
3357	I really wasn't sure if this dress would work for me, so i was very excited when i fell in love with it! i haven't experienced any quality or tearing issues with it as one reviewer noted, thank goodness! i love the color scheme and versatility of this dress. i have worn it with tights, a belt and short-heeled ankle booties to make it a little more dressy. but i most love it with some funky jewelry and leggings, wearing it more tunic style. the slip underneath is a great feature as well! it does
3358	Oh this is so much prettier in person! what you can't see from the pics is that the bottom flutes out a bit. it is quite charming. fits true to size.
3359	This dress is so beautiful in person. it is not overly flowy, well made and extremely feminine. i really have not a bad word to say about it. and on sale, it's a steal. i plan to wear mine with tall boots as shown and with my cowboy boots.
3360	"I purchased the pink top and really like it. it will be a ""go-to"". the material is light but not skimpy, and it has a nice drape to it. the length is good for me (5'4"") and it fits tts."
3361	"My review is of the ""black motif"" (no longer listed online, but i saw a bunch in the clearance sock bin at the georgetown dc store, today, 12/27/2015).  i love beautiful and unique socks! so i thought i'd give these a chance. i like them so much that i bought 3 more pairs of the exact same sock now that they're on sale!  two things i noticed... the way the sock is knit, when you put it on, it no longer has a matte black look in the black areas. it is sort of a stretched, slightly two-tone look."
3362	I had my eye on this coat for so long. when i saw it was on sale and an extra 30% off i decided to go for it. i ignored the reviews that said it ran big and took a chance and sadly it did not pay off. this jacket is very heavy so if you are going to get it on sale, it will probably go into the closet for next winter. it was very boxy on me and tied at the waist, made my upper half look huge. it was just not flattering at all. the heaviness of it also made the big open neck a little annoying and
3363	Love these.they are a lovely gauzey cotton so they actually feel light. they do have volume however i don't believe they make you look bulkier though i suppose that depends on body type and how they are styled on top (i first wore with a form-fitting sleeveless chambray button down). that said, i sized down which meant the waistband was really too snug and so i sewed the button over to allow more room, which is why i gave them four stars. they have an elegant retro feel, versatile for spring and
3364	"I sized up to a medium from a small and was glad i did. the top drapes nicely and the fabric is soft.   5'7"" 140 lb 32 b, usually a small on top."
3365	I've tried or bought nearly every retailer cashmere sweater this season. this one fits the best and the yellow is a bit darker in person, not quite mustard but a deep rich yellow. i wish they would offer more colors.
3366	These pants are amazing. they are so comfortable and fit true to size. i typically wear a 28 or 29 depending on the pants and the 28s fit me perfectly. i bought the olive green pair and they are everything i have ever wanted in a pair of olive pants. i love that they are tighter in the butt area and loose in the knees and calves so they are not restrictive. i want every color!
3367	"Saw this in the store and immediately liked it. when i tried it on, i loved it. colors are muted, and the style is very flattering. the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy, which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south. length is perfect for me (5'8""). it does look great off the shoulders, but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more work-appropriate look. it does run slightly large. i wear a large, but went with a medium in this one so it wouldn't be to"
3368	From unique shape to feminine design, this cropped summer sweater is the kind of item that attracted me to retailer thirteen years ago.  it's also flattering, especially for this petite, who doesn't like to show her upper arms.
3369	This skirt is really beautiful and well made. the color is a cream/off white like other reviewers mentioned. it fits mostly true to size--i have a straight build with a wider stomach and no hips and my usual 4 fit a tad tight in the waist but perfect in the hips. i just love this skirt.
3370	I got so many compliments on this the first day i wore it. i think of this more like a sweater coat than a regular sweater. it is extremely soft and warm, but not bulky at all. it lays really neatly, which is why i think of it more like a coat. this will definitely be a staple moving into the winter and then into spring. keep in mind though that this does not button - they're just for show.
3371	"Ok, so to be honest i just bought these two days ago so as far as wear and tear i'll have to get back to you on that but i seriously think i will just live in these. first they are so so comfortable, soft material, stretchy but not so thin that they accentuate every little curve but also very flattering. i'm 5'4"" 127 lbs, curvy in the bottom with a smallish waist and purchased size 28. there is a little bit of room, which i'm happy with, so they don't squeeze the love handle area or make it unco"
3372	The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty, but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest, it was very unflattering.
3373	I was looking for a dress that was short sleeved but not sleeveless. this fit my needs--not too short, nice v neck (but not deep), pretty embroidery overall i like the dress. here are a couple of downsides--i wore the dress with tights--and due to the nature of the fabric (cotton) there was no 'glide' and therefore it rode up with the tights. also, it's a bit wide int he mid section. i wanted an 'easy' and not tight/form fitting dress, but this does have almost too much fabric in the mid section
3374	
3375	I'd been looking for a replacement for my faux leather jacket and this has surpassed my expectations. well-made, lovely color, very soft, flattering cut. it runs small so i sized up from my usual petite xs to a petite s. it's warm and the lining is very pretty. hopefully it'll hold up to daily wear. i'd definitely recommend it as a great jacket to take you from fall - spring. i got the plum color.
3376	I love this blouse! i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on. this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging. i don't live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively. i have larger hips (135lbs, 5'6) and finding flattering tops can be tough. sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on, they just don't look right. some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter. this top looked great a
3377	I so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good. i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful color....but......the fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips. first the fit, the arm pits are low and don't actually tuck into where your armpits are, so you have this weird restriction in arm movement. then the design is not great either (and others mentioned this), the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi
3378	I am so happy i ordered this jumpsuit. it is exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. the fabric is light and it's very well made. great length for dressing up with heals or dressing down with flats. i love it!
3379	I cant say enough about this top. the material is soft and comfy . very well made. the length and  size is spot on! looks great tucked in or out! very versatile. highly recommend!!
3380	I originally bought this dress in another color back when retailer was doing the 25% off dresses promotion a few months ago. i had seen it on a store associate at my local store and absolutely loved it, but hemmed and hawed at the original price. it was a splurge even at 25% off, but as soon as i put it on i was in love. this dress is so soft. i wore it to see some old friends, and after every hug i received a comment about how unbelievably soft it was! the material is thick enough to have a decen
3381	I found these jeans on the sale rack at my local retailer. they were the very last pair and in my size. i couldn't believe my luck.  i tried them on and was very impressed with the fit and feel of the jeans. thyre soft yet substantial. they retain thier shape. . love the worn in look to them.  .. .. so adorable.  nice slouchy skinny jean.. i stayed true to size
3382	"These fit beautifully and are very flattering. they are true to size but may be a little long. i am 5'5"" and wear these with 2 in. heels. i have already had numerous compliments on them."
3383	Gorgeous dress, colors as appear in picture, thick material- quality is good. sizing- im usually a size 2 or small, got a small, and it is big in the chest/ length is below the knee. would recommend a size smaller than normal. not a huge deal- small alteration job.
3384	Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.
3385	Just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite. the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero, it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift. and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely. i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting. i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this, but mind the size of the slip in the petites range, and also it is aqua.
3386	I bought this in navy and love the multi textures and look. i'm happy it was on sale because it is so cute but i would not have paid full price on it. it runs small. i plan on wearing it for casual errand days.
3387	I love the fabric, texture mix and length of this top. i gave it a four stars because my usual size is a medium but had to go with a large. a medium felt a bit too snug through the shoulders. very happy with this top and look forward to wearing it a lot.
3388	Bought this dress for a wedding in petite. fits true to size. beading & embroidery is beautiful in person. only downside is that the beads & embroidery are very delicate and damage even when sitting on a chair.
3389	"Like other reviewers, i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it! well, i am very disappointed. the colors aren't as rich as the outdoor photo, although they're brighter than shown in the studio photos. this is just not a flattering dress. i've put it on three times and taken it back off. the neck is too high, the sleeves are too narrow (and i have really skinny arms), and there's no ""swing"" to it. i am 5'4"" and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small, which is what"
3390	Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting, so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight, the length is a not-too-short above knee, the tiered layers swing so nicely, and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o
3391	Love these jeans, comfortable fit and material is soft.. fit true to size and have a good rise.
3392	I loved the criss cross part of this tank. however, it looked so frumpy on. the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent. i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on. i returned it. the material felt nice too.
3393	I love these pants! they really make you look and feel classy. i also bought the feather tank and absolutely love this outfit! it is flattering, beautiful and oh so comfy! true to size,
3394	I wear this vest a lot for it is really cozy and goes with a lot of different types of outfits! it's is versatile and figure flattering. i only buy timeless pieces that i know won't go out of style and this vest fits the bill!
3395	"I am not a model shape but this dress looked so light and beautiful i had to try it. it wasn't available in my local store so i risked it and ordered online. i'm 5'6"" and about 175 lbs; the medium fits perfectly. i will say that the skirt fabric comes much more sharply pleated than it looks in the photos, maybe this hangs out/mellows over time. the lining to the knee is going to be great for warm summer days. can wear to work with a shrug and some flats or to a summer wedding. the pattern is bea"
3396	The dress was great! the zipper was just a little tough but over all a very classic, feminine piece.
3397	I love the tiger print. its subtlety is the perfect added quirk to an outfit.
3398	It does run a little small. my regular 2 fit but snug. the colors were drab and the material felt like straw. the lining is really silky and nice. just didn't work for me .
3399	Beautiful top, i love the peplum. the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace. i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so it's going back.
3400	I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic,that will be in my closet for a long time.
3401	I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it, no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim
3402	I like the skirt. that said it is going to the tailor to have some of the fullness taken out. just a lot of material going on, and heavier than you might have imagined. i will wear it fall & winter with white & navy cardigans.
3403	"I just received this top in the mail and i couldn't be happier with how it fits and feels on. might have to wear a camisole under with a bit see through in front. it is very true to size and drapes beautifully with the back being very feminine. i am 5'6"" and the length falls just about the same on myself as does the model. i will wear with skinny jeans with the nice length working well with them."
3404	"I ordered a pair online, they came today and i am in love! the fit is great, i love the high rise waist. i will have to hem the bottom, i am a tad short (5'3"") and it is rare that i don't have to hem my jeans. they make my legs look longer and are a very flattering fit. i am very pleased with my purchase."
3405	I absolutely adore this top!!! i got it in the blue and went back a few days later and got the gray as well. it's super soft and casual but still really cute. it's a little long (i'm 5'4) but i tuck in the front or tie a knot on the side and it looks good. i wish they had more colors so i could have a few more of these!
3406	This is one of my absolute favorite dresses of the season! fun, flirty and fashionable! i wore it with a chunky necklace, floppy hat and sandals one time and with wedges and dangly earrings the other time. it is a must own dress!
3407	I love this top! i just bought it on sale so the price was great but it would have been totally worth it paying full price! great quality, unique, and great fit. i look forward to wearing it all year!
3408	"Really cute dress for work. fits exactly as i expected. this dress is very comfortable and looks put together on days when you're being lazy and just want to ""throw something on""."
3409	Just tried this on in store. the color in the photo is wayyyyy off. it's a hunter green and dark navy zigzag. for maeve it runs large. i am usually a medium or a 10 and a s worked best. i'm a 36d and there was no pull at the bust. will pick up when on sale (bc a hundo for rayon is laughable).
3410	"This jumpsuit is lovely and comfortable, with gorgeous embroidered detailing, but it really needs to come in petite sizes. at 5'4"" with a pretty proportional torso to leg ratio, i found the hem length okay but the top portion way too long. for the waistband to be anywhere near my natural waist, the shoulders would have had to be taken up several inches and the armholes shortened."
3411	So cute and a must have. took my normal p6 and fits perfect! love it
3412	You just can't go wrong with a perfect white top. i'm usually xs or s and got this top in xs & the fit is perfect. the bottom is a very subtle bubble hem that you can't really see in the picture. the top is boxy but not too overwhelming since the proportions are just right. thesis a great transitional top that will go with skinny jeans, pencil skirts or even a pair of utility pants. it can easily be dressed up or down.
3413	The quality of the fabric and the design are perfect. i love the cut out and how flattering on my shorter figure. i am somewhere between a 6 and 8 and the 6 fit perfectly. it can also be strapless which is a sexier version.
3414	These leggings are amazing. by far one of the most comfortable pairs that i own! i should have ordered more. i got a m/l and they fit perfect. the detailing is awesome, and they even stay opaque when you sit, so you don't have to worry about them being see-through. great buy!
3415	"Love at first sight (via the internet); upon arrival, i was on the fence. . the fabric is slinky and loose; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large (perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body). the lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms; every slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth; otherwise, when the arms are extended, the sleeves do hav"
3416	Bought this dress on sale in the orange as i feel like everything i have is black. it is a pretty orange not too bright, more of a rust color. it is very soft as stated in other reviews and has a nice built in slip that is very comfortable. i worry about pilling down the road but will have to wait and see. i am not crazy about the seams down the chest area. i think they could be more flattering but overall the dress is comfortable, cute and easy to wear, a perfect dress for the fall/winter with
3417	I do wish this came in a 30dd sizing, purchased he 32d and it fits, though the band is looser than desired. i am still keeping it. i love the back, will be great for some of my dresses ti used to wear strapless bras to wear. recommend.
3418	This is a cute stylish sweater different from the typical. it doesn't itch which is key at least for me. i ordered an extra small but i am normally a small since it seems to run long. i think the neckline is unique :)
3419	I really liked the dress on line, but, i didn't appreciate how lovely it was until i received it. it fit perfectly, and has a lovely flare at the hemline for a flirty feel. i wear it with taupe colored booties and it is perfect for work and afterwork.
3420	I love these so very much! by far my favorite addition to my wardrobe this summer. i find they are the first thing i grab because i feel wonderful in them. they fit perfect even with a large bust which i was afraid i would not be able to pull off....but very tastefully do. i highly recommend these and i plan to wear them into the fall with boots and long sleeve t-shirt. worth every penny. if your size is available grab them...you will be happy you did.
3421	"Let me preface this by saying, im totally keeping this dress!  it is kind of a weird design, but intriguing. i received it in the mail yesterday, i am 5'6"", 125 lbs and have hips. as a previous reviewer mentioned, this dress is more fitted than a swing dress as it appears. fortunately the xs fit me just right - but i cannot gain another lb.  my husband said that i looked like i was in a choir because of the higher neck design and bell sleeves, but he too found the dress somewhat alluring."
3422	"I'm in love with this top! i usually wear a s/m or 6, and the size 6 fits perfectly. the cut is very flattering and i love that the sleeves can be worn rolled up and buttoned or down (and when they're down they hit right at the wrist, not too long or short). it's lightweight and comfy, but looks really pulled together. i can see myself wearing this both with ripped boyfriend jeans and sneakers and with dress pants and a blazer. a great transitional piece.  i only wish this came in solid white (o"
3423	These pants pair well with anything - dress up or down, boots or sandals....but beware, they run big and rear end stretches out when sitting at work all day. if you have a booty these pants will be perfect buy one size down tho. if you have a flat rear like me, then buy two sizes down. length is good to leave uncured, just above ankle or roll up to perfect height. great color - fabric is amazing.
3424	This sweater looks great with chambray colored denim. i wear it with jeans, shift dresses and even leggings. definitely one of my go to sweaters for the fall.
3425	"So much to love about this dress! the color is exactly as pictured in the video, not photos. the fabric is substantial, beautiful colors. the dress is well constructed , back zipper and is easy to put on and take off. it is not only lined but has a crinoline built in to the liner! it's not super puffy, just enough to give it some flare. i am 36b, 5'8"", 155 lbs and bought a 10. it fits me perfectly! the shoulders are a smidge too big but not enough for me to have them taken up just yet. oh, and i"
3426	I just love this dress - so comfortable and flattering. maeve has had some great dresses this summer, but this one may be my favorite. this one could easily been worn in to fall with a sweater or jacket.
3427	They are beautiful! they fit amazingly! they ripped on a seam the third time i wore them. i kept wearing them, because again, the fit! the style! alas, about the fifth time i wore them, the other leg ripped at the knee seam. they are just totally falling apart. it's so very sad. i would wear them alllll the time if they could bear it. i'm actually thinking of buying another pair because i love them soooo, but it would likely be wasted cash as i believe there is a real manufacturing issue here. w
3428	Great shirt. i couldn't picture the material but it's washable and great for hot days when you want to look styling.
3429	"This top is everything it promises to be. i read other reviews and purchased a small (i'm typically between an x-small/small depending on the day of the week) and was glad i did. a medium would definitely have been too big but the small fit perfectly. i have a shorter torso (5'3""/117 pounds) so i didn't experience any apprehension about my stomach showing. i paired it with a pair of skinny black ankle pants and a pair of navy and grey d'orsay heels. it worked wonderful and i can't wait to pair i"
3430	Love the dress. i usually wear a small and will be exchanging it for an x-small.
3431	I was very excited to get this dress in the mail. i wasn't sure about the sizing because there weren't any reviews written yet. i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine, but there was just so much fabric below the bust. i love that it's different, but i think you'd have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you. it does not flatter your body at all.
3432	I was really lucky to pick up these shorts during the tag sale, and they are great! lightweight, roomy in the legs (way more my speed, i prefer shorts that don't cling) and really soft. they also weren't too short. i am usually between two sizes at retailer, depending on the brand, and ended up going with the smaller size. they're not really a size too big, but would've been a little too roomy/baggy in the waist, had i not purchased the smaller.
3433	Wanted this dress several months ago, but it was out of stock. finally was able to order and very glad i did, it is perfect! it fits exactly as i had hoped, the length is great, right above my knee and it hangs beautifully. looks great with my caramel colored boots and i received many compliments. just hoping they do some more drop waist dresses, especially for summer.
3434	I'm pregnant (2nd trimester) and really wanted a beautiful, non-maternity dress. i got this in ivory and it's just perfect. the lace on the sleeves is really comfortable, i love the fit, and i love the length. i got tons of compliments on it. my only regret is that i didn't also get it in slate and i really wishing it would get re-stocked.
3435	In love! just wow. beautiful colors although they're dark you can still see all the variations. the flannel is light and not too heavy. there's visible black lace just below the shoulder. pretty buttons. ordered the large, my normal size and it's a perfect fit. roomy but not oversized. so well made i think this will be a favorite for years.
3436	"I absolutely love this dress. the color is beautiful and saturated, the fit is spot-on and so flattering. i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5'9"", 170# 34f bra and 40-41"" hips. i love this brand!"
3437	The pattern attracted me to this top in store and when i tried it on, i was pleasantly surprised it has a slight swing shape to it which i love. i'm a 36c/d and normally wear an 8 or 10 and bought this in a large. the front buttons don't peek open and actually lays flat which is unusual for me with button up tops. i'm actually wearing it today with some printed green shorts. the stripes on this top make it easy to mix patterns, too :)
3438	"I took a risk and bought this blouse and got a wonderful surprise. i bought my usual size small (34c, 31"" waist) and it was perfect. the details of this blouse are amazing. you cannot see the flecks of copper-gold leaves all over the fabric or the gold threads running down the seam in the front. it is really, really beautiful. the fabric overall is soft and flowy and the sleeves do not stand out off my shoulders in a weird way. there is a soft flow of ruffle down both sides of the shirt. the fro"
3439	I love everything about this tunic : the color, fabric and design! i am very happy with this perches!
3440	I just bought these jeans today & they are really cute & comfortable on. i love pilcro jeans as they fit really well, they are made well & they are always on style. i did have to go down a size as well but they fit beautifully! comfy & stylish!
3441	It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. wouldn't recommend. though it is sooooo soft!
3442	I absolutely adore this skirt! sadly it was a lot of skirt for me- i'm 5 feet nothing and it would have been too much fabric to hem. wish this skirt came in a petite size. great color and a fun option for the fall wedding season!
3443	The cream color in this dress is divine. such a stunning dress that can be worn with a vest, jacket or alone. it looks very luxe and expensive in the cream color. because it's a knit, can go smaller in size. i tried on both the x-small and small. opted to go with the x-small. found it fit better.
3444	This is a great tee. true to size, i ordered the large and it skims nicely over my hips. it has lovely quirky design features in the back and pinkish cross stitches on the sleeves and shoulders. i got the blue and it looks just like the pic. great weight for the rest of summer into fall. perfect addition to my casual life style.
3445	This is a super flattering, cute tank! i've purchased it in several colors because it's such a great fit. somewhat thin material and slightly sheer (especially the white). i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit' fat shows. looks great with pilcro capris for a cute, casual summer look! i wish they would come out with even more colors!
3446	"Love this dress! paid full price and completely worth it. fit tts for me- i'm 5'8"" 135 lbs., with a slim upper body so i had no issues with the neck being tight. definitely would be braless or need a strapless bra. gorgeous material, light and breezy dress. best retailer purchase in a long time!"
3447	I love this! very comfortable & cute dress. true to size & picture. can't wait to wear it!
3448	I love this tunic! with that said the reason i only gave 4 stars over all was because the material wasn't what i was expecting. it's more like a thin sweater like material, with raw edge which normally is fine but i do worry about how long this will last. the design and colors are lovely! i have worn it with leggings and cropped jeans and it looks fantastic! great summer top/dress/tunic!
3449	I'm usually a 12, or size l in retailer and when i tried this on, buttoning it up from the bottom, i was so excited...until i reached the chest. it was way too tight in the bust and i am not that big in that area - it was painfully tight on my 38d chest. it's also unlined, which makes it not very useful for anything other than the warmest times of year. it's a shame because the skirt is swishy, and a good length - many trenches are too short, or not wide enough on the bottom for a fuller figure. i
3450	This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldn't work for my body. i'm athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it's just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn't busty and has slender upper arms.
3451	I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i love the colors and pattern. i've just been on the fence whether it complements my hippy frame. i'm a size 8/10 right now. i do like it with or without the tie for different effects. one concern is that the website says hand wash and the tag on the seam says dry clean only. i usually don't buy dry clean clothes, but might make an exception for this one.
3452	I love this tee, i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal.
3453	This was completely different than i expected. the xs/s was so large that it looked messy. unfortunately i had to return it.
3454	"I love this shirt! it's gorgeous! got it last night, wore it today, and received compliments all day long.  i don't normally look good in tunic length tops, but somehow there's magic in this one. the seaming on the front totally hides my post-baby pooch. too bad the baby just turned 3 and my pooch isn't going anywhere ...!  adore."
3455	I love all the pilcro chinos. they fit great and the material is so soft. they also wash very well.
3456	I am so glad that i got this one.i wish i got the bigger size,but got it on sale.i am glad,that i have it for next winter.
3457	I love this dress! it is comfortable and pretty, well made and classic. it edges toward the larger size however it is supposed to be big. i got a small and at first it looked too big but the shoulders are perfect. i feel like sissy spacek in this gown and you will also!
3458	Like other reviewers, i did find that this jacket runs big. i am usually a size 2p or an xs and found an xxs in store and fits well. it'll be a great everyday-jacket!
3459	I knew from previous pilcro purchases to size down. went down 2 sizes and they fit perfect. this dark wash doesn't have as much stretch as some do which i prefer because they stay up all day.
3460	"This is the second dress i buy at retailer this year and this one is spot on!! exactly what i was looking for: feminine, dressy yet can be dressed up or down depending on the circumstance. the fabric in this dress is particularly gorgeous, very comfortable on the skin, very flowy so it doesn't have a ""heavy"" quality to it and the design is amazing with the navy ribbon on the front. i completely fell in love with this dress! this is a little number to keep for many years."
3461	"I want to hate these jeans because they are so expensive but every time i try these on they just look so cool.  they seem to be handmade so the flowers are not in the same spot on each pair."
3462	I tried this on in the store and thought the flowy fit and asymmetrical hem were great. the fabric is thin, which is nice for summer, but lined at the top half so it's not transparent except below the knee. the waist is quite high and has flexible elastic for an easy fit. i liked the skirt a lot and came online to find it in petite. sadly, it is sold out of most sizes in the petite length. i wish antrho would order more of the petite sizes because they seem to sell out fast!
3463	First of all, the photo online doesn't really do the colors of this skirt justice. it is a heathered knit, with colors of white, gold (deep yellow), raspberry (or almost maroon), and teal. i have never seen a color combo like this before, and its really fun. i am wearing it today with a burgundy color sweater, but i anticipate being able to match it for summer with any of those colors i just mentioned, or even navy or tan. the skirt has a lining in it, and the wide ribbed knit runs at varying an
3464	"After reading the reviews, i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasn't flattering on me.  i'm 5'4"", 126 pounds and generally wear a size small, but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me. it squeezed the bust a bit too much, and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering."
3465	This is a beautiful dress. the detail is amazing, but it runs a little small. i'm usually size 0, but i had to go up a size in this dress. its cut a little too tight, and there is no give in the fabric. otherwise its stunning!
3466	Chambray top that is soft, but thick/heavy so it drapes well and is very flattering on. untucked, the top is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it hangs like a tunic, almost a-line so do not size up or you will have too much material. i am a sz small in most retailer clothing, and the sz 2 fit nicely. sz 4 was too loose around my arms, and the sz 0 was too tight around my chest. nice neckline and a pop of surprise with the gorgeous lace detail in the back.
3467	This is a beautiful top, however it looks better on the 80 pound model. the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body. if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are.
3468	"When i saw this sweater, it made me think of the 70's chic trend thats very now but due to the colors (my favorite tones) it would be something i would be reaching for for years to come. i love it combined with jeans but i also worse it over a dress (see photo) - i am wearing it over corey lynn calter floral dress ""paeonia dress"", and i paired it with the ""rosebud layered necklace"". i got two of this sweater as i want to have one for when i wear the first one out :) i am 5'6"", 127 and even thoug"
3469	I bought this blouse in both the cream and the blue. both are lovely. i would say that the size runs a bit large, i bought size 12 and the bodice hangs away from my back, arms fit well though, loose fit. hangs well. the lace is nice and stiff. the cream has some cafe au lait shading on some of the lace so it could almost look stained. i don't think that will be how it reads, though, but fair warning.
3470	"I tried this jumpsuit on in the store and loved it but decided to wait on purchasing it. after it went on sale i jumped on it because i new i would regret not buying it.   i am tall but most of my height is from my long legs, not in my torso. i seldom find jumpsuits that fit my frame but his one fits perfectly. the fabric is very ""flowey"" and does not wrinkle. the overall design of this jumpsuit is slightly but not overly baggy. the pattern and pleating make it a perfect item for spring and su"
3471	Bought these in store and bought another on line. super comfortable and great for a casual look. great length as well! love the pilcro line.
3472	Bought this for my girlfriend and she couldn't be happier! she's a size 4/34c and the small fits perfectly and is so flattering and comfortable. highly recommend.
3473	I went to my local retailer store in kansas city,mo at country club plaza and let me tell you when i saw this sweater i mediately fell in love with it. i bought mine in the red color in a size medium and it fit me perfectly. i would definitely recommend getting this sweater because it's so soft and very flattering on my body type. i also love the pattern and definitely worth the money!!
3474	I am very happy with this shirt. i don't like skin tight clothes. i bought this top a bit loose but it does not look like i am wearing a sack. it is tunic length on me so i have worn it with jeans and boots. i love the way it flows while i walk. very flattering on. would definitely recommend!
3475	I purchased this on sale, xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater, but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy, but i would say itchy and cozy!
3476	This dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me, not so much. i am normally a size 0/00 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker, but it was very thin and didn't seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design, just not the right material or fit.
3477	I purchased the pale green in this sweater first. loved it so much i purchased in another color.
3478	"This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size, it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out.   the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust."
3479	"Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges. i'm a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out. it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesn't make the wearer look big; it falls elegantly and in a flattering way.  great, versatile shirt."
3480	This is one of my favorite.it is timeless for sure.
3481	Great, special cardigan. fits like a shrug and a little short but is perfect over a tight fitting sheath. great for broad shoulders.
3482	Mutliple layers of buttery softness. i bought the blue and it's true to size. it is soo soft, i could wear this to sleep. it drapes beautifully. highly recommend it. now i want to buy all the colors!
3483	"So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5""6"" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition."
3484	"Wow... i'm in love!!! when i first saw this i put it in my cart... when i went back to purchase it, it was sold out in my size... i was so bummed. i kept checking back and saw it was restocked so i quickly ordered it... thank heavens!!! when i first took it out of the box i thought it might be too ""grandma-y"" of a design... but i was wrong. it's just gorgeous! can totally be dressed up or down. so flattering. love love love it!!!"
3485	"I was so excited to receive this jacket - have been looking for a ""leather"" jacket for a while and thought this would be the perfect one. unfortunately, i have broad shoulders and it seemed a little tight. i got my normal size s based on retailer shirts. maybe if i got the m? although, the s fit well in the waist, so... also, my small chest (32b) didn't fill out the darting in the chest area. one last wish, was that it was a little longer.  as with all hei hei, the inner lining was very cute. ove"
3486	Love this tank. material and fit are great. love that it's reversible. highly recommend!
3487	"The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.  dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to"
3488	"I recommend this dress for people who do not have my body type. the dress is very comfortable and nicely designed. my torso is a bit barrel chested with a large bust so the fabric both wrapped and billowed out unattractively, causing the waistband to ride up and the skirt to pouf out over my tummy. if your body is more like the model, this is a flattering dress. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140# and ordered the medium petite. perhaps if i bought the non-petite version or sized down maybe it will"
3489	Super large and a very weird cut.  the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me.
3490	"Loved the idea of this top--but it just won't work for me. it's really big. i'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs. a small should be fine, but i'm swimming in this. the back is pretty (i tried it on with a white cami), but it looks very maternity on me. tried to order the xs, but it's sold out. too bad. was a cute idea. not too thin for summer."
3491	What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point, i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead, i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s, made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.
3492	This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.
3493	This skirt is gorgeous. i'm glad i saw it in-store as the picture online does not do it justice. the colors are really rich and the pattern has a sentimental, vintage feeling. it also has pockets and a great, glamorous swing to it. this skirt is great for work with a blouse and heels and also looks awesome with a t-shirt tucked in and sandals. the fabric has a really nice four season weight, i think it will also look great with high boots and a turtleneck in the autumn. i get so many compliments
3494	
3495	Okay, i am not that tall and don't have legs for miles, but i loving wearing a wide-legged cropped pant with heels for a change from the everyday. these pants are great because they are 99% cotton. the cotton is a nice weight (not too light) and the barely there fringe bottom is a nice detail. i usually wear a 28 in pilcro and that's what i bought! i would describe the color as leaning more toward khaki than green, though it did look little green under the lights in the store.
3496	Light and airy. runs really small. had to go up 2 sizes. a little pricy but overall a cute blouse. not your typical blouse.
3497	"Drawn to the colors, i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist, size 10/12 or l in fitted tops this top is a cropped, even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement), but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full, so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up, too. the quality is an issue, with exposed threads and irregular seams."
3498	"As other reviewers have noted, this is a pretty top. i really love the design. alas, however, it is too big for my frame. for reference i am barely 5'1"" and about 105 lbs. i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me. it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place. the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits. i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp. i am going to have to part with it, sadly."
3499	First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee. i don't know why they do that.... you're not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it's cheap! second, i'm usually a 0-4 in retailer and mine is no where near as loose-fitting as the photo. also, he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit... like a flimsy t-shirt. and see-thru. the sleeves form-fit to my arms so i couldn't layer under it, but i couldn't wear it alone with the fa
3500	"I was looking for a layering piece to go over leggings or skinny jean to cover my backside. i really like this swingy top. i agree that it does run large but i was looking for something flowy so i love it. the cream is a litttle more sheer than i expected so i'm wearing a cami underneath. maybe being taller 5' 8"" helps it not seem so much like a tent. well made and just what i thought it would be from the website model photo. (i used a 20% coupon so help easy the pain of the price of this top -"
3501	I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it.
3502	This dress is perfection! great, quality fabric. bright vibrant color. the design and texture allow it to be dressed up or dressed down. i sized up a size because my normal wasn't available and it fits perfectly!
3503	Just purchased this on sale. will be perfect for summer on those days you wear dresses and don't want your skin to touch the subway bench! love it!
3504	Love this layering piece! a little low cut for my personal comfort, but a tank underneath works great.
3505	I'm not entirely sure if this shirt just runs large or if it fits oddly/boxy. the flowered material puffs out on the sides a couple of inches under my arms... i'm usually a pretty solid size medium, but i think i'm going to try to exchange this for a small to see if that solves that weird fit issue, because it is a nice idea of a design and comfortable overall. but, if that doesn't solve the trick, if not recommend, b/c that side puffiness isn't flattering.
3506	Love this print and fabric! its soft and comfy with adjustable straps. so pretty and feminine!
3507	"I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber, which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 5'8"" frame so the shirt tail hems peeked"
3508	"I love this tank - the colors are great and the fit is flattering. the fabric is lightweight but not cheap or so thin that you need to wear something under it. i am 5'7"" and the length was fine for me."
3509	"I purchased this shell in black. the embellishments and construction of the top are of a good quality, like as shown. i am 5'4"", 120# and typically purchase an xs. this ran a bit bigger than i was expecting from the reviews, but i am overall happy with the top. the center slit may be too revealing for those with a smaller bust."
3510	This jacket is extremely good quality, has gorgeous detailing and is warm! quilting makes it thicker than expected, but plan to wear as both a blazer and fall jacket. highly recommend.
3511	"I was disappointed when the dress came in the mail. it was much shorter on my than on the model in the picture. (i am 5'5"") the detail of the dress and fabric shown in the picture is not as prominent in person which was also disappointing. the dress is just average. i didn't not return the dress...it looks much better on my younger sister (who is the same height) so i gave it to her. i guess it's just not the right dress for me."
3512	
3513	"Not my typical sleepwear, but glad that i took a chance, as it is super cozy for lounging. i was worried about covering my bottom (as i purchased the matching leggings), and ordered s based on prior reviews. ended up exchanging for xs as it was too oversized. could have purchased the petite probably as xs is still a bit long (5'2""), though fits like in photos."
3514	This vest is simply amazing. i wear all black and throw this on top and it becomes the perfect outfit. i love that the top portion of the vest is light weight and thr fur portion is so soft. tts
3515	This romantic top has lovely embroidery and beading details. i purchased this in purple, which is actually more of a cranberry color. i like that the detail work carries over to the back on the cap sleeves.
3516	I was nervous about this purchase, but it turned out to be a new favorite. the blue color is stunning on and i can easily see this taking me from work to dinner. i am normally a size 2 or 4 in dresses. after reading reviews about how this dress runs large, i ordered a 2 and hoped i didn't have to return it. the 2 is perfect and roomy. the drawstring can be let out or in for more figure definition. this really is a beautiful and modest dress.
3517	These are such a great fall staple. the silver color is the perfect grey-olive, and the texture is perfect. doesn't feel like there is extra material like most cords, and they hold their shape throughout the day. the fit is just perfect, i can finally order pants online that i know will fit just perfectly.
3518	I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried, i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy
3519	This sweater is far more slouchy and relaxed in fit than in it seems in the photograph. definitely size down. honestly, i kinda love it anyways! the inside is so very soft, and it's perfect for a sleek errand-running or hiking kind of day!
3520	I loved this dress when it came out last spring in gray. this year, i got the red and sand color. it wears so easy and can be dressy or casual- depends on how you want to wear it. i would say each color fits differently, try them on. the dress is worth the price.
3521	I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list. i'm so happy with it. its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3). the pattern on the front is very flattering.
3522	This is such an ethereal flowing dress.more gray than light blue as it appears in pix.love the flowy bell sleeves.its a modest length just above the knee.quality a bit lower than is the retailer norm but still good.
3523	I had this dress in my basket for a long tiem waiting for free shipping. i liekd how it looked on the model. read the reviews, and wasn't sure, so waited... then my usual size sold out, so i decided ot try the smaller size (in petites, otherwsie i would have gotten it in the store :_)) i needed pettie and the smaller size is perfect! the color says black, but it looks more mifnight (aka blue), my friend even said (when i tried it on), you know i laways love anything blue... so don't expect dark
3524	"I've never owned a romper before but after trying it on at the store, i fell in love! i'm pear-shaped 5""4 at 185#. i got a med and it fits beautifully with just enough room to not be baggy. i got the red mitif. super flattering."
3525	This skirt is absolutely beautiful. the design and organza are so feminine, and i love the length. it flows beautifully and it isn't stiff or anything, but it does hold its shape well. i ordered it through the store, and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days. i think it would be easy to snag the material, so i will be really careful when i'm wearing it. the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt, and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu
3526	I like this top because it covers the bum.  it is a little longer in the back than front.  it is cotton modal soft, and it is light enough for summer.  the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail. i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer, but classier than a tank top.  i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter.  i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility, material (for comfort), and classical style.
3527	Caught my eye because of the colorful graphic print, in my closet because of the super sale price.  it fits as expected in size medium, a little bit long since i'm short.  i'm unsure of the longevity since it's a viscose mix.  feels a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i don't really wear tank tops without layers so this is a great addition to my casual wardrobe.
3528	I ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner. i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height. i was for sure it would be too short in any other size. when i put it on i was drowning in it! i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal. has the potential to be super cute and flattering, yet the timing and sizing didn't work out. definitely give this one a try!
3529	Don't try this on, if you don't plan to buy it. it feels amazing!!! i bought the black and it is a lovely charcoal color and matches so much.
3530	This is a very cute dress that i did not keep. mainly because i did not like the neckline on me. if it had been different i probably would have kept it. i liked the fabric, the top is a little thin, but i did not think it was sheer. the bottom part is sheer, but there is a lining. it drapes beautifully. it is a little like a maternity dress, but not enough to dissuade me.
3531	Saw this dress in the retailer catalog and tried on in store. didn't need a dress but ended up purchasing as will be wearable for summer/early fall. seems like a print dress cut and style that will be used for many seasons. outer fabric is a bit delicate/may snag, and a bit wrinkly as another reviewer said, but works with the dress.
3532	"I'm so glad the other reviews were so good. i couldn't agree more. this top is very well made, lined. i'm 5'5"", 32 dd and got the 6. i'll have to take up the shoulders a bit since the v falls a little low on me. what can i say, i'm modest. :) i wish they made more colors. this top is awesome."
3533	I could seriously sleep in this--it's that soft! i dressed this with a white tee and holey jeans then i wore it to work today over a blue midi dress. love this jacket!!!
3534	Got this today and am really pleased. beautiful detail and i love how the cowl neck hangs. it's not itchy at all. overall, a great find for the colder months ahead. i got a small and probably should have ordered xs  instead. runs a little big on my petite frame.
3535	Classic and stylish. trendy with the blocking...rich colors, soft and comfy. i typically wear s and s was perfect. i love this sweater.
3536	The fabric is very soft and the fit is formed to the body. low cut, so may want to pair with a cami. great basic for work!
3537	Would buy this again in a heartbeat. so comfortable and fit is great. color will look good with jeans or a dress. bought it for a cruise in the spring and it is perfect!
3538	These jeans! i tried these on, in addition to the high rise paige denim, and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother, with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs, but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a
3539	I was excited to try this on in the store today. the zipper details on the shoulder are really cute and the ribbing pattern is flattering. i was disappointed when i put it on though because it fits like a baby-doll / pregnancy top. it's snug around the bust, and then flares out pretty widely through the lower half. you can't really see that on the model. i was hoping it was more of a fitted tee, but sadly, that wasn't the case.
3540	I was pleasantly surprised with this cardigan! i get so many compliments- i can easily see me carrying this into my fall wardrobe!
3541	"The retailer by me actually had this and i had to try it on. my thoughts below: ___________ pros: - well-constructed with lining underneath to avoid the need of a cami or tank. no see-through issues whatsoever. - the fabric is great quality and looks nicely sewn. no fraying or strays seen on the 2 sizes i tried. - there's a back zipper that goes from top to bottom at the back. unusual as i don't see why that's needed since you can just slip it over your head. - front ""v slit"" isn't too low or reve"
3542	This skirt is unique yet versatile and gorgeous. everything about this skirt works: dazzle balanced out with softness and midi length. the twirly width shows off the skirt in a subtle way, and super comfortable. no petite 2 left so i purchased a regular 2 and it fits perfectly (i am 5ft2in, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls about 2in. longer than shown on the model. this skirt is sold out fast, no surprise. it flatters all body types at all ages. get ready for lots of compliments!
3543	"This is adorable! i got it to wear on the plane for an upcoming vacation. this is definitely tts. i am normally a medium and got the medium. i am long wasted and this fit just fine. looks like it does on the model. the material is super soft too. it is also easy to get on and off which is sometimes difficult with rompers. plan on wearing it with gladiator sandals and a jean jacket."
3544	I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim and bought it immediately. finding a jumpsuit for my body type is hard (small chest, rounder in the middle and hips like whoa) but i have to say this one is ridiculously flattering. love the quality and feel of the fabric. i've worn it both braless and with a bandeau and have not needed to wear a shirt underneath, but then again it isn't a piece i plan to wear to work. i'm usually a sz 8/10 and got the medium regular which is perfect. i'm 5'5 and the bottom hit
3545	"I wasn't going to even try to see it this dress would fit.  it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model.  i'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it!  my outfit is a floppy straw hat, skinny leather belt and flat sandals.  there's a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out.  i ordered the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#."
3546	Very pretty dress, perfect style for my build, bigger busted, muffin top. the material/pattern is really pretty.
3547	Love this romper. fits perfectly, and looks like the picture. i'm 5 ft 7, 125 lbs, and usually am a size 4 or small. i ordered a small, and it fits beautifully. i've worn this a lot this summer in florida, and am getting a lot of compliments. don't be put of by the long sleeves for summer wear- the romper is loose enough and has a nice flow to it.
3548	This top is cute. i purchased a 2 instead of my usual size 4 and it fits well. i only recommend buying this top on sale. it is not good quality! there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through. it is totally nuts that it costs $88.
3549	This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy, just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.
3550	
3551	I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock, or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing, as i'm fairly skinny, but still curvy, and while i love my curves, i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this, however, is a godsend.
3552	Soft pretty socks. a little big if you have smaller feet. i'm a size 7.5, and they are a tad too big but still comfortable.
3553	I am waist-challenged. i like a narrowly cut structured sheath dress, sort of like the 60s styles. this is a great dress either belted or loose with great accessories and lovely shoes. it has so many colors in the pattern, you can wear this with anything, and the fabric is so high-end and quality that you can definitely wear this to work with a jacket and then change into a denim or leather jacket and tough high boots and go out for the evening in the fall-winter. it arrived in the mail and righ
3554	Nice basic shirt to wear with jeans. it is super soft and hangs nicely. runs true to size.
3555	I absolutely love ag stevie ankle jeans and own them in three different colors. i'm on the shorter side, so in terms of length i'm able to wear them as regular jeans. the fabric is comfy and stretchy and the range of colors is great for wardrobe diversity and mixing and matching! this particular style is my absolute favorite. although ag jeans are on the pricier side, after i bought my first pair i was a convert. as opposed to other brands, i find that they are a worthwhile investment. as other
3556	Love this top. got xs fits perfectly. wish it came in more designs
3557	I was on the fence about ordering this jacket, but i'm so glad i did. i got my birthday discount to help afford it. as the first reviewer said, the weight is substantial, but not too heavy, and the embroidery is beautiful! i have not worn this jacket yet, but i expect to get many compliments when i do! i usually don't wear jackets in this style, so it's a fresh, new approach for me....the embroidery takes it to the next level! it fits true to size. i usually take a medium, and the medium fits pe
3558	This is such a cute vest. nice and cozy. so cute paired with a long sleeve tee, statement necklace, jeans and booties. very happy with my purchase!
3559	Love this dress. the fabric is super soft and flowy. be aware that the model is a tall gal.... i'm usually a size 8/10 in dresses and purchased a large. returned it for a large petite as it went way past my knees. looks funny if it is below the knee. the petite is perfect.
3560	The sweater is light and very soft. the silver banding on the neck, sleeves and hem make it easy to dress up.
3561	I wanted to love it - the color is great, the embroidery pretty, but the stiff scalloped sleeves were just too much. if you have broad shoulders this is not the shirt for you. i think personally it would have been better had the material been softer.
3562	I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great, soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.
3563	I almost bought this skirt yesterday in store, but decided against it because the fabric was subpar. the skirt i tried on was snagged and unraveled. i selected another skirt, which i purchased. as the sales associate was folding the skirt, i noticed that this one was also snagged and unraveling. despite loving the style and fit, i had to be realistic with my lifestyle and decided to return it then and there. if there were two severe snags on two skirts before even leaving the store, how would th
3564	I wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm. they get the job done and for an incredible price. they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside. i'm not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but it's subtle and i don't mind it. they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots, the length not a problem. my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg. retailer kindly sent me a new pair for
3565	Kicky little pleat in the back is interesting and comfortable. great fit, good colors and doesn't wrinkle easily.
3566	"I bought this dress in an xs, and am 5'4"", 115 lbs, and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug, but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side."
3567	"Just got these mara hoffman classic bikini bottoms in flight azure print.today and love them: high quality, fully lined and reversible. the pattern placement is perfectly symmetrical and the colors are just like the online photos. . i think the size chart on the mara hoffman site is correct for where the bottoms sit on my body, above the widest part. i have a a-shape with smaller waist and hips, full behind and thighs (currently 33-25-37ish, 38"" at the widest which is at my thighs). in these t"
3568	"I wanted to love this dress.....the reviews were great, the price was right and i needed a simple black dress. the fabric (jersey) is lovely and drapes nicely and the print was pretty. unfortunately, the armholes were way too long and low for me and even with a black bra, i was sharing more of my lingerie than i wanted. perhaps someone with a slightly smaller chest could size down and avoid oversharing! for reference, i am 5'5"", 145 and wear a 30gg bra. i ordered the m."
3569	"These are my favorite tights. i love how they are opaque. i love that they are thick but not so thick as to be only appropriate for winter. they are slimming without feeling too tight.  why don""t you sell these any more??? please bring them back!"
3570	This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is.
3571	This is such a unique piece and could be dressed up or down. i can see myself wearing this with skinny jeans and a tee and adding a statement necklace or wearing over a dress. i tend to get hot so i like how light weight this is even though it is lined. it is of excellent quality but may run slightly small (or at least smaller than other items i have purchased through retailer). the drape is extremely flattering and i think that would be true for every figure. my favorite feature is the oversized
3572	Just received this dress in the mail. it's stunning!! the lace is just beautiful. i ordered two sizes and had to size down a bit - the fit is generous. can't wait to wear this to my rehearsal dinner next week.
3573	"I love the color and textures of this jacket. the shawl color adds interest while being cozy and fun. wish it ran a tad longer. otherwise a great mix and match piece."
3574	Loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors. love the luxurious feel of the silky, flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways. however, after washing per instructions, the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah, pilled mess that gathers at the seams (especially the bottom seam). tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing. looks like a cheap, lackluster layering top now and definitely won't last another season. so disappointed - if you ca
3575	This is by far one of my favorite dresses i have tried on in a long time. i am a 2-4, the small was tts and so flattering. i think this would be better for someone taller with a lean frame, though its not super tight and the material has a great weight to it, it isn't lined and could definitely show figure flaws. for me it skims my body elegantly and was very comfortable through the bust, waist and hip (34c/26/36). it fits me like the model in the image. the one down side is that it is pullover
3576	Unfortunately, this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big, too shapeless.
3577	This is a nice light weight cotton i purchased for work.. i usually take a size 4 or 6. i bought it online and opted for a size 6. i will be exchanging this for the smaller size, as it is a bit boxy and the sleeve length is ample. once the exchange is done i look forward to having this blouse that i can wear untucked and still not be wearing yet another tunic (my go to style).
3578	I love this dress! it's so comfortable and perfect for the summer fall transition. it fits true to size and isn't to boxy or tight. i love the colors as well!
3579	Love this top!  it is fitted through the shoulders and arms and has a slight swing.  the peplum falls at a great spot and the material lays nicely.  very flattering on my 5 months postpartum body that is on the rebound.  i got the blue but i might get the pink too!
3580	This is a very beautiful summer dress with plenty of lightweight fabric. i loved the colors and the design. i know that some other reviewer complained that this is polyester, and it is, but it feels like chiffon. the only two complaints i have are- 1. the dress is large, so go a size smaller than you would normally, and 2. this is dry clean only! if this is polyester, why would they suggest that it should be dry cleaned only? that is going to take a chunk out of the budget to get it cleaned. oth
3581	
3582	I thought this dress was beautiful, but i felt it was a little young for me. i am 55 and was looking for something to wear to my niece's wedding. if i had been the mother of the bride, i would have kept it, but....
3583	This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.
3584	Gorgeous print on light weight layers in a cut that's flattering, feminine & fun.  i sized up and ordered the the 12p to fit my large rounded rib cage & 36dds.  i agree with previous reviewers that the bodice runs small.  i will add that the neckline is tight if you have a fat neck like mine.  stats are 5'3'' 140# 36dd 8/10 on top, 6/8 on bottom.
3585	This dress is very soft and comfy but transparency is an issue. having said that, i think as long as you wear flesh-colored undergarments you'd be fine in a casual situation. the natural fiber is especially comfortable and the detailed stitching around the neck and chest area is pretty. my store didn't have petite sizes and the regular length was too long for me so i passed on it.
3586	"I think this fits to true to size. i am 5""2 and 107 lbs. i always wear a xs. it was a tiny bit tight in the bust if i wore a big padded bra (34b). if i wore a normal very little padding bra, it did not pull much across the bust."
3587	This dress is the perfect combination of bohemian chic. however, the slip below the dress runs a tad bit small. i have a wide rib cage and normally wear between a 04-06. the dress would have been just perfect if the slip was a bit larger.
3588	Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.
3589	I ordered the navy in an xl although am generally a medium or large in tops. i sized up because it looked fitted and i think it was a good choice for me. it fits just like the model but the back droops a bit and the neck is wider. my bra is still covered in the back.  it fits perfectly in the waist and the elastic allows for some adjustment in placement. there's 2 layers of ruffles in the skirt portion. i'm 66 and was concerned it would be too young looking but i love the look. it hits about an
3590	"I purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it on-line and ordered it in my usual size petite 6 (i'm 5'4"" 34d-27-35) and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on. i immediately adored all the different prints on this one, the length, the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter. it's a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well. also,"
3591	This is a terrific top!  the supima cotton is super-soft; the black, a deep black.  i love that antho is listening, and that it's made in the usa!  the lines and flow are beautiful and flattering.  i bought the medium and am a reliable size 8 top/medium, 34f.  the sleeves are nice and long.  don't miss out on this classic tee, friends!
3592	"On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...  ref: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist."
3593	I think this shawl is much more stunning on than on the hanger. i think it will be a great piece to transition into fall, wearing it over a black or white tee. it can be dressed up or down. especially for the sale price, a great piece!
3594	This top is so beautiful! whenever i wear it i get lots of compliments. i have washed it a few times on delicate and it still looks great. i do have to wear a cami under it, but the way the straps of the top are made, you cannot see see my bra or cami strap.
3595	Great coat. love the length but it definitely runs big. i got a m even though i would normally be a l and it's roomy. fabric has pulles under the arms after 1 wear but overall quality is good. very warm. great look for work w. black pants.
3596	This dress attracted my attention with its victorian inspired print. the details are to die for. the blue is not the same as the picture. slightly darker and more muted.
3597	Every byron lars dress that i have is definitely beyond ordinary and this one is no exception. i love the petals that adorn the front.  my dress was back ordered for a couple of months but it was well worth the wait. i wore it recently and received compliments galore. if you're undecided about this one, go for it!!!  it's a winner.
3598	The top is nice, good quality, etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.
3599	"When i was purchasing this i asked to myself ""do i really need another black jacket"". when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket. this jacket is special. it is light weight - but structured. it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing. this jacket is my new favorite."
3600	I was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model. i ordered my usual size 0 but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable. i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it wasn't as form fitting as i would have liked. i ended up returning this dress.
3601	Great cardigan that can be put over everything! cute with yoga pants, jeans, or something dressier.
3602	Finally saw this dress online. i have to say that it looks better in person. the model might be too tall for this dress. i am 5'4''. it's right to my ankle. the color is in a nice off white. the material is a good quality. the overall cut is nice. it's a kind of classic feeling.you could wear it for a long time without going out of style.
3603	"I always go w/ black, but deviated this time & so glad i did! quality fabric, not sheer at all. a great layering piece and new staple for the wardrobe. fits tts, sm (i'm 5'2"", 109lbs)"
3604	Hate i have to return it - way too long-almost more mid thigh/almost dress length.
3605	I stumbled upon the blue version in the store. i immediately liked that it was easy, chic, and just different-enough. after wearing it for a birthday dinner, i saw it online and realized that i had styled it almost exactly the same way the blue one is shown. black sandal wedges, silver cuff, silver earrings. it is flattering in an unexpected way, which may be partially because i am really small-chested. the front v is deep compared to what i usually wear, but double-sided tape easily kept my bra
3606	This is a beautiful piece. the fabric is a nice weight and the cut of the lace across the shoulders is flattering. the sleeves are dramatic, but not overly fussy. sadly i returned the dress because although it is a swing style (no waistline), it has a very straight cut. i was hoping it was more of an a-line silhouette to accommodate my hips, but alas. if you self-identify as a pear, this may not be the dress for you.
3607	"I received this top over the weekend and i absolutely love it! it does not smell, nor does it itch, as the other reviewer stated... at least not for me. i was worried about the green color, but it's quite lovely. this is a keeper for me! i am 5'1"", but ordered the regular xs, and i am happy with the length."
3608	What a cute swing sweater and so easy to layer. this jacket looks great snapped or left open and the collar and hood leave such a soft look around your neck. this has such great elements of cozy and warmth just in time for cool weather!
3609	This is a lovely jacket. i thought it was going to be thicker, but it's so classy and chic. i got several comments on it, and i've only worn it once! great jacket to have in my closet. i can wear it to work, to dress up an outfit for school, or to complete an outfit.
3610	"This fabric of this top is gorgeous. however, i'm 5' 5"" and it hits in a really weird spot. right no the point of the hip that you don't want to accentuate. you could wear it with leggings to a casual thing, but i work in an office so its too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans. sad, i love the top 90% of it."
3611	Based on the mixed reviews about fit, i waited to purchase until i could try it on in the store and was not disappointed. i'm wondering if there are different batches of this dress? i'm 5'7 and the dress fit as in the photo. the side slits come above my knees but not too high. arm holes are a bit large so if you want more coverage this may not be for you. the material is cozy and soft. the cream color is gorgeous. size wise, it definitely looks boxy and marshmallow-like if too loose. i am usuall
3612	Absolutely adore the simplicity and style of this dress. dress is quite flowy, the fabric under the pleats is very soft making is quite comfortable.
3613	First saw this jacket in the catalog, in peach, and had to have it. i received it today, and love it. its a soft, muted peach, very neutral. i ordered xl, im usually a m-l, but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy. the quality is great, feels good on. love it so much, i just ordered it in the dark grey. very classic jacket, will wear for years. one of my favorite hei hei pieces, never disappoints.
