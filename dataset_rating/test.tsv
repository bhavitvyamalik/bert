3000	"These socks feel amazing-i have them in both colors.  you would be surprised at the softness of these socks, yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks. i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me. i feel like these would last a long time, with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spa-these socks are soft?  these socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li"
3001	While the print is cute, the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra, more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully, if retailer continues to do swimwear, they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)
3002	I love this coat! it does run a bit large. i am 5'2, 125 pounds and usually, wear a petite in most retailer clothes. i ordered a small, but wish that i would have ordered the xs. the length of the jacket is fine, but the arms are very long. i think that i might have the arm length hemmed, but it looks ok rolled up too.
3003	"Really cute dress for work. fits exactly as i expected. this dress is very comfortable and looks put together on days when you're being lazy and just want to ""throw something on""."
3004	I love love love these pants!!! they actually fit me and look great!!!! buyer beware that the dye used is very delicate. i had a very slight stain on them that most likely only i noticed, but i decided to use a spray and wash stain remover. the resulting removal of the stain came with a very large loss of color anywhere the stain remover touched. unfortunately this has made these pants unwearable. buy, wear and wash these with care!!!
3005	"I was bummed about this dress! i saw it online and loved both colors. i tried it on in the store, and it did not work for me. i am 5'8"" tall with an hourglass figure, and it was too shot and too loose. it looked like a babydoll nightgown. i wanted to love it, but i think this one only works on smaller frames. onto the next..."
3006	Looks really nice on teh pictures. i tried on thre cream as this was the only color availalbe at my store (tried on per stylist recommendation(. it is very thin, you can see ripples from my belly lol, but still fairly flattering. i ended up purchasing, but it is in my maybe pile for now... wil lwait before wearing it to be sure. can't wear a grey bar with it, that htin...
3007	I have an hourglass shape and this dress is a good fit. i think this dress looks better in person than it does in pictures. however, i'm concerned about washing it with that stark fabric and color change.
3008	When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?
3009	This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large, i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so, but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe, though, is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled, the background color of this skirt is not even close to
3010	These are great jeans and worth every penny. they hug every curve and have just enough give in the places that you need them. i find them to be very figure-flattering and dressed them up with high heeled boots and a nice blouse. even though i'm petite, i ordered a regular in my size (26) because i wanted the length of regular jeans as opposed to ankle length.
3011	Love this sweater. i have it in both colors. it's lightweight - a nice late summer/early fall option. the sleeves are really long which i love. because it's a loose knit, it will snag somewhat easily, so be a little careful
3012	"I bought one of each color. love them all! they fit well and are very soft. washing and drying them are not a big issue either. i didn't notice any shrinking. i wear xs and s depending on the fabric and cut. for this, i bought a small. (i'm 34a, ~125 lbs, 5'8"".) it's loose and flowy without being overly baggy. the tail of the shirt reaches just below my butt. if you're going to wear this with a pencil skirt or low rise jeans, the buttons on the side might get in the way a little. but that doesn'"
3013	"I tried this on in the sotre (in balck) as i was planning on ordering the orangey one.  my usual is 0 or 2, sometimes petites. i thought the regular 0 was sjut fine and flattering. fabric is soft, adn every pattern they ahd in store was really nice (no orange-red though). was not overly snug anywhere, and i am a bit braod for my size.  i deceided not to purchase only because i have done seriosu damage in the last month *multiple purcahses) and this was one of 2 i had to pick... if it goes on sal"
3014	"I took the advice of the other reviewer and ordered a medium in this (32d, 31"" waist, 38.5"" hips) instead of my usual small. it fits perfectly--a tiny bit loose like on the model. i bought the beige. you need a camisole underneath but the layered effect is very pretty. it is a delicate material which is why i gave it 4 stars. i can't speak to the quality of it, but will definitely use a hand wash cycle and line dry it. very pleased."
3015	"The lace on this top is pretty, and i liked the way it was styled in the product photos, but did nothing for me on. between the loose sleeves and the boxy cut of the front, it just sort of hung shapelessly on me. i also found the back to be much shorter than 30.5""--it came to a few inches below my hips and was not tunic length like i expected. the shoulders fit me well, and because the top was boxy already, i didn't want to size up for length. for reference i tried on xs (i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs)."
3016	"Ok, so to be honest i just bought these two days ago so as far as wear and tear i'll have to get back to you on that but i seriously think i will just live in these. first they are so so comfortable, soft material, stretchy but not so thin that they accentuate every little curve but also very flattering. i'm 5'4"" 127 lbs, curvy in the bottom with a smallish waist and purchased size 28. there is a little bit of room, which i'm happy with, so they don't squeeze the love handle area or make it unco"
3017	I typically wear either a 2 or 4 and had to size up with this coat. the 6 fit, but i decided to go with an 8 to ensure it'd fit with layers. the sleeves aren't lined, so it's a little itchy against bare arms. it's really flattering and i love the pattern!
3018	Saw this online- my size out (xs/s p). online did have xs. checked store saw how great the dress looked at store, able to try on only one avail at store (m). ordered xs online. fits well with ada belt and cardigan. until straps altered will keep cardigan on.very comfortable and cute- lots of compliments worn to work
3019	I stalked this blouse and when the price dropped, i pounced on the black. sadly, it did nothing for me. i'm a large, sometimes medium, but decided on the large. you'd think it came with its own cami at this price, but no. completely sheer. unwearable without one. the lace is nothing special. the collar is wider in the back, uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front. the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back. i'm returning this one.
3020	I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this shirt. it's comfortable, the fit is excellent and flattering, and it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. i bought it in the brown and the black and have no regrets.
3021	This oversized coat is fabulous! i've received so many compliments on it.
3022	I paid full price for these gladly (the olive ones) and was delighted when i was able to purchase the black on sale. they are midweight, soft, flattering and stylish. they stretch a little (belt needed) but not much. pilcro are my go-to pants and these hit it out of the park. i wish they would come in a lighter weight version for warmer weather !
3023	Has it been 5 years already. i too bought this 5 years ago. it peels and doesn't close but the horses make up for that. very very warm.
3024	I ordered this top in the pretty, sea glass green color. it is adorable on! it's constructed from a nice thick cotton and has a billowy swing look if you are into that, which i am. the cut of the neckline gives it a cool 60's vibe. my only issue is that the arm holes are cut small. also note that because of the wider neckline, i found putting a necklace on squashed it in a strange way. i'm still keeping it because it is awesome in every other aspect. most likely i will just jazz it up with fun e
3025	"So i tried on the regular size in the store, and love the top, but looked too big on me.  color is gorgeous and rich, the sheer adds a little whimsical to it, and i love the tie-neck trend of lately. would go nicely with jeans (skinny or flare) or trousers, not sure about a skirt though,."
3026	Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.
3027	Loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors. love the luxurious feel of the silky, flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways. however, after washing per instructions, the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah, pilled mess that gathers at the seams (especially the bottom seam). tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing. looks like a cheap, lackluster layering top now and definitely won't last another season. so disappointed - if you ca
3028	Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.
3029	This product is comfortable and stylish. i love the design and the color print. i can dresss it up and dress it down. it goes with everything and also fits great.
3030	I love this with white leggings that skim my legs b/c it is a looser top that you can cinch at the waist. one small complaint is that the tie is awkward with the side slits, but for the sale price, i can overlook this.
3031	Great spring time dress that looks good with a thin top, a cardigan or by itself. the fit is a bit loose but not oversized in my usual size, so if you want a slimmer silhouette or you are not busty, i would size down. love the fabric as it has some give despite its thickness. i would have paid full price but i'm lucky to have purchased on sale.
3032	I was a little surprised when i received this dress, as it is little more than an a-line tube with elastic casing at the top and a cute knotted detail at the bust. i guess i expected the bust to be lined at least. it is unlined, and a relatively thin jersey knit. it wasn't see through, for it is black, but i expected a heavier fabric. i would never have paid full price for this, but at the sale price it is very cute and comfortable. it is also flattering and the fit is true to size. the a-line t
3033	I got size 2p. it comes down a little over my knee cap and i wish it was rather a little above it. i have a small chest about 32b and with a padded push up bra it was still bit loose on the top. i do have a shorter torso. i feel like i could've gone with the 0 petite. i'm a pear shape and more like a size 4 on the bottom and i weigh about 115lbs- there is tons of room to go smaller - it is not form fitting on the bottom at all. has that slight polyester feel but the fabric is beautiful and thick
3034	I love this skirt. it is stylish and very comfortable. ladies, don't be afraid of wearing a pattern on the bottom. it is flattering and slimming. i wear it with a black wrap sweater or black cotton casual jacket.
3035	"I love this jumpsuit! i ordered it unsure, but i am so glad i did! it is super comfy and fit perfectly. i loved the length...can dress up or down. it is super flattering as well as i am curvy on the bottom and was told i looked ""trim"". my mom, friends, and complete strangers complimented me when i wore this...and that's when you know you scored."
3036	Great lightweight summer top that's bra friendly.  i bought the teal color yesterday and wore it today with white skinnies.    i'm sometimes a small and sometimes a medium and was fine with the small on this one
3037	Great fit and very cute design. goes great with jeans.
3038	Such cute tights! i saw them and had to have them. they are a thick knit - very good quality. the color is a dark navy and the little foxes and a nice pop of color. i get lots of compliments on them.
3039	"I just got this suit in and i was pretty excited about it, however it does not have lined cups like it says. no boob support whatsoever, though i think the pattern distracts enough that i'm keeping it anyways. (34dd). i do think it might be too short for a taller person. i'm only 5'4"" and it just barely comes up high enough to cover me, and i don't think big boobs are the reason. also it is pretty cheeky, which it does mention. maybe a little expensive, but i did use a coupon."
3040	I decided on these last minute for a date last night and let me say...i looked hot. :) they are super cute and flattering (im slender, but hey, im also 53) and could be dressed up or down easily. the but is because when i got home i realized that i had ruined my new gel manicure from the black die! it comes off so easily that you should be cautious of your car seats, sofa, etc. i made the mistake of not washing first, but do! hopefully thats enough to help because these are great leggings.
3041	"I love clothes, and my mom raised me to look for styles that are different, and unique. these pants are it! they fit beautifully, but run slightly big. i'm between a 4 and a 6, actually kept both. the 4 fits great in the hips and legs, plenty of room if you have curves (i do not), but it's a tad tight in the waist, if that helps. these are a perfect length, at 5' 7"" they hit above my ankle bone, and look perfect w a pointed, closed shoe. i love the colors, and am bored to death of black and grey"
3042	This dress is absolutely beautiful! and, had it been just a little longer or a little shorter i would have kept it. but, the hem hit me at just the wrong spot! alas, i had to send it back :(
3043	I purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear! it went back i hate dolman sleeves.
3044	I really love this top, great colors, comfortable, long enough (always a problem for me), light but feels quality fabric and nice details.
3045	Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting, so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight, the length is a not-too-short above knee, the tiered layers swing so nicely, and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o
3046	"I got the dress with the boat pattern- such a fun dress and very flattering. it is definitely a coral, but i am able to wear this with my fair skin and will probably look better with some color as spring/summer finally arrive. i am only 5""2' so the length is great for me- i can wear this to work, but it would be pretty short for a tall gal. definitely recommend!"
3047	I ordered a size down as the reviews suggested and i love them!! they are so cute and snug enough in the calf that i can wear boots with them in winter.  great buy!
3048	Although this is a very lovely dress in the pictures, and it has a lovely quality in person, the shape and orientation of the dress is very awkward. the attached slip makes it tricky to put on, and the sizing between the top and the hips seems inconsistent (tight in the hips, large in the top). not quite for my body type - maybe better for someone with slim hips and a bigger bust.
3049	"I purchased this in the black and received it today.  it is silky feeling and is a quality camisole.  the color is a muted black, not all shiny as some silks are (and they often look cheap) but this looks great and could be worn alone, under leather, or with a sweater/kimono.  i usually wear a medium in tops, and this fit true to size.  i am 5'2"" and it doesn't look too long, but i do wish it came in a petite.  still keeping it!"
3050	"Great fit and quality. i'm 5'3"" and 130 lbs, size 4 fit perfectly. bought both the blue and black. could definitely dress up or down!"
3051	Cute top. i always get compliments when i wear it. a little boxy in style
3052	I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item.
3053	I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.
3054	Saw this dress in the retailer catalog and tried on in store. didn't need a dress but ended up purchasing as will be wearable for summer/early fall. seems like a print dress cut and style that will be used for many seasons. outer fabric is a bit delicate/may snag, and a bit wrinkly as another reviewer said, but works with the dress.
3055	I tried a pair of the hyphen chinos on at retailer and loved them. they are comfortable and a great casual look. i bought two more pairs in different colors on line.
3056	"Rompers are usually tough for me. i am petite, especially on top (5'2"", 110 lbs, 34a), but have a healthy butt and hips, which can make sizing difficult. in this romper, i tried a regular xs, and found the fit very flattering. the top was blouse-y on me, but not overly so, and the arm holes didn't gape, which is usually an issue for me with non-petite sizing. the elastic waistband is also great, as you can adjust it to hit you in a flattering spot and keep the shorts from being too short (which"
3057	I have many left of center tees, and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color), which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long, the cotton is thick, and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite 5 stars for me, though, because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me, though.
3058	Finally saw this dress online. i have to say that it looks better in person. the model might be too tall for this dress. i am 5'4''. it's right to my ankle. the color is in a nice off white. the material is a good quality. the overall cut is nice. it's a kind of classic feeling.you could wear it for a long time without going out of style.
3059	This has a very nice hang to it- combination of the cut and linen- like fabric. i liked it so much that i bought two different colors. so many tees are blousy and full now;i am short so they look like maternity tops. this one is much more flattering.
3060	This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large, arm holes are very low.  not flattering.
3061	I am petite so ordered in the store and they shipped to my home. i ordered a 24p and they fit great. they stretch a tiny bit. goes with a lot of tops and they are light weight which is great with houston westher
3062	I was hesitant to get this piece but for the price i couldn't resist and i'm so glad i got it !! it is beautiful in person and can be worn so many  different ways.  it really makes you look slim too ! i got the size small and i am 5'4 and 130 lbs and it's a perfect fit !!
3063	Very cute everyday tee. usually run between an xs or small with retailer and was happy i chose the extra small. a great updated on a classic strip tee.
3064	This top is really cute online, but that's about it.  it runs large, but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly.
3065	I love this shirt so much i bought it in another color. it looks like it does in the picture, loose and flowy.
3066	Comfortable and flattering for all body types...good for both day and evening...
3067	Can't pants. the material is lightweight and perfect for summer. however i felt they were cut narrow in the hips. i am a solid size 30/8 and i couldn't get the 30 over my hips.
3068	"Received this dress yesterday, love it! my initial hesitation in ordering this dress, even though it is my fav color....was rather bright for sept.. but loved it and decided to order and wear it next spring. delighted to open the package and see that the dress is much darker than in the pics...more of a jade green. it is still a summer fabric/style, however the darker color will be perfect for the warmer fall days ahead. this dress is beautifully made, superior workmanship, and the fabric i"
3069	Saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on. so lovely! i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person. it's like a muted blue that makes it so versatile. the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering. the safety pin is such a unique touch. it's nice and warm, just not super soft, but not scratchy. i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily.
3070	I love this top. i bought it in the blue but loved all the colors. i fell in love with it on-line and hesitated ordering it only because i was afraid that the arm holes would be too large (based on what i saw in the picture). fortunately they had it at my local retailer, so i was able to try it on. my usual xs fit perfectly. great flow, soft and casual. perfect for those cool nights in the summer or layered with a cardigan in the winter.
3071	"I found this at my local store and ended up buying both colors. the fabric is thicker than a t-shirt. these will go with so many things....jeans to dressy skirts. i normally wear a small but ended up buying the medium (2). the small fit me but was a little too short (for reference i am 5'8""). these will be a staple in my wardrobe all year round. love!"
3072	I loved this dress when i tried it on. the plaid is darling and the plunge is sexy. i so wish it would work for my body type. the waist came a bit too high on me (almost a line) and it made me look kind of frumpy in the midline.
3073	The pictures are not showing how absolutely spectacular this caftan is. it is very delicate (even says so on the tag) and lightweight so that you won't dread wearing it in the heat of the day. by what doesn't show up is that this caftan shimmers-there is gold string woven throughout the entire garment which gives it a slight sheen. it adds significantly to the impact of the garment, and i love this detail. i love the way this caftan drapes, and i love that it is longer than a normal caftan. the
3074	Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit, more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.
3075	"I ordered the ""london, paris, milan"" print red top in a size 4. i go back and forth with ordering 2's and 4's but i figured that with long sleeves, i'd rather have a little room than it be fitted. my boyfriend asked if i bought it for valentine's day- the red print and the cities struck him as romantic. anyway, lovely top. lightweight material will be nice for layering during winter, and wearing on it's own in spring and next fall."
3076	Love, love, love this piece! very flowy, but made of good material. glad i purchased this item!
3077	"I've never owned a romper before but after trying it on at the store, i fell in love! i'm pear-shaped 5""4 at 185#. i got a med and it fits beautifully with just enough room to not be baggy. i got the red mitif. super flattering."
3078	I love this jumpsuit! it runs a little large but still works for me. it makes it super comfy and a great piece for every day!
3079	I absolutely love this jacket! i bought it and wore it to work to next day, and received tons of compliments! it is easy to move in as i have ark that required stretching and bending alot. i am 5 5 119 pounds and xs fit a well.
3080	Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful, but it also stops the material from stretching, so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also, they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger
3081	-i normally don't go for these tops because with my hourglass frame and wider hips, it only makes me look wider. however, like others, i was drawn to the fabric and feel.the bottom half really is lovely and looks expensive, and the top half is stretchy an
3082	I bought this sweater to freshen up my fall wardrobe and just love it! adds texture and warmth to every outfit.
3083	"I loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets. the fabric was a nice weight, not too thin like lots of retailer tops. i liked the top from the front, however the back was way too long, especially with the looseness of the style. it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted. it might work on someone taller. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. and i tried xs."
3084	This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders
3085	The first day i wore this jacket to work, three people told me how great it looked. it's stylish but comfy, looks great worn with a tunic and leggings or accompanying a skirt and tights. best of all, the camel color is a great change from black and as a bonus, doesn't show my orangeish lab's dog hair!
3086	"I love this shirt. i actually bought two in black (my ""uniform""), then decided to order one in white as well. however, the white shirt fit differently than the two black ones! it was significantly shorter; over 2' shorter! while the black tee is the perfect length, the shorter white version wasn't flattering on me and kind of flared out around my waist...not the best look. that being said, i know the black shirt will be in heavy rotation for a while, and the people at retailer were very und"
3087	"Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges. i'm a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out. it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesn't make the wearer look big; it falls elegantly and in a flattering way.  great, versatile shirt."
3088	My heart's a-flutter for this top. the fabric has an excellent weight and feel to it, and the little, fluttery cap sleeves are to die for. i've ordered this in almost every color because it is such a great staple. it is a gorgeous pairing with the marala knit skirt (especially in green,) and the double stripe jacquard skirt, but i'm certain it would be a perfect choice for any pencil skirt. it's so flattering and comfortable, with a neckline that is perfect for single strand pearls or similar le
3089	I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist), so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear, but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o
3090	The linen- cotton blend breathes so well for a hot summer day! the design on the waistline is super cute and yes they are a little long in the leg but that can be a plus+ for vertically challenged girls like me. wedges and platforms are perfect to show off the soft drape of the pant legs. now that they're on sale, i'm snatching up other colors, like white and light khaki- already have the seersucker blue pair!
3091	Saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning. i usually wear a size 8 because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a 6 in this top. it was not tight in the arms (don't have super skinny arms) and the fabric flows nicely (not too much). the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit!
3092	"The overall color of this dress is more buttery white and the pale golden embroidery almost blends in.therefore i think the dress benefits from being styled . i tried bold colored scarves with fringes and big statement jewelry. this dress is more casual with its fringes , the jeans like material ( although softer than cotton) as well as the loose pullover style. it is easy to dress down with a blue jean jacket, casual sandals or even sneakers.  i have a 38 c chest and the l fits almost too loos"
3093	"Like other ladies have mentioned, this dress runs small in the chest and waist region. you must size up! __________ pros: - flattering fit and flow. hides lumps and bumps. - cut at the neck and back is cute and didn't make me look chunky surprisingly. - little red polka dots aren't overwhelmingly at all and add a nice retro feel. - good overall length. - usa made! __________ cons: - runs small in the chest and waist. i'm a 36c, hourglass, 170 lbs and normally can wear a size 10 in tops"
3094	A great sweater to throw over just about anything. i love it, but the only reason i couldn't give it 5 stars is because you must be very carful with it, as it can snag on anything. the fabric is similar to intertwined ribbons. the first time i put it on i got a snag right away, but it was easily pulled trough to the inside. now i am just super cautious. i do love it though. very comfortable and super casual. not heavy at all, but just enough to be happy to have to throw on when the cool spring/s
3095	I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it's a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass.  had to send it back.
3096	"This is the second dress i buy at retailer this year and this one is spot on!! exactly what i was looking for: feminine, dressy yet can be dressed up or down depending on the circumstance. the fabric in this dress is particularly gorgeous, very comfortable on the skin, very flowy so it doesn't have a ""heavy"" quality to it and the design is amazing with the navy ribbon on the front. i completely fell in love with this dress! this is a little number to keep for many years."
3097	These jeans look amazing on! hug every curve in just the right way....the long length with flare...add a platform heel and i look like i have legs for days!! and my booty will definitely turn some heads! total splurge but for a great pair of jeans, totally worth it. ordered my usual size 27 and they fit like a dream. hope they don't stretch out after wearing a few hours. the amount of stretch feels nice, so i think they'll continue to hug your body. if you want 1 pair of flares in your wardrobe.
3098	Fit is boxy yet flattering and material is sheer but not overly delicate. took my usual size four, i am moderately short waisted.
3099	The fit, the length, the color, the fabric... cannot say anything negative at all! the sales associates at the store where i tried them on said they had just gotten them in, and she could not wait to see how they looked on. they were just as awed as i was! the pants can easily be dressed up or down.. the brown color is so, so, beautiful! i would expect these to be twice the price for such a high quality pant.  i consider it a timeless cut and can worn for seasons to come.
3100	I love simple, comfortable tops with interesting details and one that i can easily throw on without much fuss. this top is made for people like me!!! the ribbed knit is super soft without being too thin, the lace is quite pretty without being too delicate. normally, tops like this have the lace portion sewn to the hem but this top actually has a whole layer of lace under the knit outer shell. so, it's like wearing a layer of lace and ribbed sweater on top of the lace. the good news is, the lace
3101	"I see me wearing this dress with more of an edgey look - not going for romantic. smoky eye, skinny dark jeans under it and pumps. swings further from body than i thought.  i'm 5'7"", wear a 34b and am typically a size 2. that's the size i bought. fits well and while pretty, it's made with heft ... not overly delicate - can't see this snagging. it's more of a cotton lace which is why it looks cool with skinny jeans. detail at the neck gives it more interest."
3102	I am normally a size 8 in dresses and bought this in a small. so if you are a smaller person, this would likely be a bit loose on you. the color was odd. i liked the navy blue, but the pink was a pepto bismol colored pink. i just felt like i would get sick of the color/pattern after one wear. the fit is cute and comfy.
3103	"The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i'm 5'2"", 103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well, but instead of looking slouchy and cool, it just looked too big. so, back it goes."
3104	"I saw this online and said to myself, next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress. i am glad i did! i bought the neutral dress (off white,tan.black) because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions. i am 5'6"", 136 pounds, the small fit me perfect! in retailer dresses i am between a small/med. the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus. the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to"
3105	"I just purchased these pants in red on sale. i am 5/5"", 143 pounds, and the 10 fit perfectly (i am either an 8 or a 10 in pants, depending upon brand). it is really hard for me to find pants that are cute, unique, work-appropriate, and flattering. these pants fit the bill in all aspects. i thought i would prefer the black, but am really glad i got the red."
3106	Love this dress. i wear a size large, but had to return and order a medium, planning to wear with boots. it's a light dress, cute for work. the only downside is that it wrinkles easily.
3107	"I love this dress in the fact that it isn't low cut, isn't several inches above the knee - and bam it has sleeves! the length is gracious and the all over print flattering for a full figure. the skirt has a wonderful swing to it. i'm 5'4"" and 165, so i ordered the 12 regular. it does fit (and has stretch to the fabric), however it is too long in the torso on me. so much so that the low waist seam pops up and the zipper bumps out when i move around. i pulled up the top by an inch or two and the d"
3108	Great tank! i really like the black and white striped one! very versatile .
3109	"I was so happy to discover that my size (00 petite) had suddenly become available again online--probably someone's return. and i wasn't disappointed when i tried the tunic on--it fit great (unlike other recent online purchases from retailer.) love the plaid and the style. the cut should flatter many body types. definitely worth the money!  please, retailer, expand your inventory in petite sizes. the cute stuff sells out so quickly."
3110	Just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress! you can't tell from the pictures. i ordered thinking it was a dress but it's actually ... culottes? i'm not sure what you would call it. the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky. it definitely goes back!
3111	So, i want to start off by saying, the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern, unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom, it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have
3112	"This dress is so fun and very comfy! the slip it comes with pulls the whole dress together! it has been great for warm fall days, but i can see it being warn with leggings and boots into the winter. i love the combination of blocked deep colors along side of pastels. i'm 5'5"" and the length is just right, not too short."
3113	I am waist-challenged. i like a narrowly cut structured sheath dress, sort of like the 60s styles. this is a great dress either belted or loose with great accessories and lovely shoes. it has so many colors in the pattern, you can wear this with anything, and the fabric is so high-end and quality that you can definitely wear this to work with a jacket and then change into a denim or leather jacket and tough high boots and go out for the evening in the fall-winter. it arrived in the mail and righ
3114	I really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy. it's shorter in the front and longer in the back. the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled. it's definitely worth trying on, but didn't fit me.
3115	Online photos do not do this skirt any justice i agree with a previous poster. i normally never buy anything brown, but there are pops of teal and magenta throughout. you can't see the gorgeous shimmer and the interesting layered colors online. in addition, this skirt has a stretch waistband (plus for the holidays!) and is so flattering, not too tight, but shows just enough of your curves, physique. i like that the skirt is longer as well - will look cute with boots. i purchased the size medium
3116	I'm a size 4 all day everyday. but, these pants wouldn't even meet around my hips. sadly, i'm returning them tomorrow.
3117	The design of this dress is very cute, but if you have an average to large bust, don't even think about it. returned, unfortunately.
3118	I was immediately drawn to this stunning blouse ( in pink) in the store. it is a fabulous silk and velvet just in time for the holidays and beyond. in true floreat style it is well made and unique.  i'd say it fits tts to maybe slightly small if you want it to fit like it does on the model. i usually buy petite sizes when available but went with regular sizing as that is what was in the store and i liked the fit.
3119	I was hesitant to purchase since this price is expensive for a tank, but the quality and true shimmery-ness are worth it. it fits very well and goes with many different sweaters. very happy with my purchase!
3120	This tunic is way over priced for the style and quality. it fit comfortably (runs a size larger) but it's not really flattering, it jut kind of hangs there looking ok. it is a little too deep of a v cut for a work top as well. this top does not support the price at all. it felt like something i could find at department store for way less. i will be returning it.
3121	I just bought this today so i can't say whether or not it will wear well but i think it will. i love it bc it's different and super comfy but also stylish. i know that when i wear this other people won't have it on. i think it looks better in person than on this model in picture.
3122	"I bought the blue dress, though the ""blue"" dress was a little more like grey according to my husband and i. the quality of the fabric was quite nice.  i have to return the dress because it does not fit me around the bust. i consider myself to have a good size bust (not huge), but the dress seems to expect quite a bit smaller.   i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual, which is what i wanted, but i guess i just wouldn't call it at all pretty."
3123	Absolutely gorgeous shirt. the quality is outstanding! only problem is that it is too small. i am usually a perfect size 6 and this will not zip. returning for a size 8. you won't regret buying it!
3124	The stitching on this dress is absolutely beautiful and very detailed.
3125	I wanted this top so bad i ordered one size up (only size left in navy) and it is a little big but i still love it. so fun, love the color.
3126	The second this dress arrived in my store i knew it was a must have. i am all things bohemian and this dress encompasses everything wonderful about a free fitting, feminine bohemian dress! first off the sleeves are not fitted. they have quite a bit of fabric to them (big armed ladies rejoice!), but have an elastic cuff so you can wear them high or low. the only fitted part to this dress is the lace panel (which still fits true to size), and the slip underneath (which appears to have a bit of str
3127	I ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner. i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height. i was for sure it would be too short in any other size. when i put it on i was drowning in it! i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal. has the potential to be super cute and flattering, yet the timing and sizing didn't work out. definitely give this one a try!
3128	"I bought this blouse in black in december of 2015. like other reviewers noted, it has a bit of an odd fit with the lace being a bit constrictive across the bust and raising arms. it wasn't a deal breaker because i loved the look of the blouse. however, i just purchased this blouse in the new color blue in july of 2016 and i'm happy to say the blue color is looser and i have no problems with the lace being constrictive around the bust or arms.  - the blue blouse i just purchased is definitely l"
3129	I bought this today in navy and loved it the second i put it on. it feels great on, is well made and flattering! you can wear it anywhere and look pulled together. much cuter in real life too. it does run a little small. id go up a size if you're getting the white so it won't cling too much.
3130	"This blazer is beautiful. it runs tts. it is lightly lined with an off-white poplin. in the body of the jacket, the off-white lining is an adorable swiss dot. though the lining makes the lace portions of the jacket not completely see through, a darker shirt would still show through. the detail is amazing - from the adorable buttons to the variations in the fabric texture. i am 5'5"", and the fit (as far as length) is very similar to what is shown on the model. the sleeves are a little on the long"
3131	I purchased this in the gold in-store. when i got home and saw it also came in turquoise, i ordered those right away as well. the fit is amazing. the pants are very slimming without being tight. they are a comfortable and flattering pant. i really love the colors and will probably snag another pair or two when able. these are a great pant to dress up or just look snappy casual in. they are a great versatile pant. i normally wear a size 8 and weight 155. the 29 fit perfectly.
3132	This hoodie is really cute-i got the polka dot color and it is very soft and roomy. i am normally a small but got the medium and it fits exactly how i wanted. however-it is not a pullover and instead zips up. so odd that the pic of the hoodie is a pullover. debated returning because i wanted a pullover, but have decided to keep it because of how soft it is.
3133	It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however, i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however, i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.
3134	A beautiful combination of eyelet with a soft fabric which lays beautifully. this does not make you look bigger then you are and i kept tts so the eyelet did not pull. mine fits perfectly. i personally will wear a cami under it as it is a bit sheer for me. it has an almost peacock print to it in colors of brown and tan. the black buttons down the back adds interest and charm. just adore it!
3135	Possibly my favorite retailer purchase ever! like wearing a cloud & fit perfectly! if you're busty - not sure about it -- but otherwise wow! told my husband: hope you like it because you'll be seeing it all the time & he not only agreed but wanted to know if they made pajamas for men.
3136	This dress is a staple. if you don't feel like getting too dressed up and want to be comfortable. this is it. will be great for travel as well. i like to pack light. so i look forward to traveling with this dress.
3137	If you're looking for a sweater that's super soft and comfortable, you've found it! you could wear this almost anywhere except for a dressy occasion, but then, of course, you wouldn't wear it with a dress anyway. i wish it came in other colors because i'd buy several. it's on the thin side but not too thin. the only thing that i should mention is that it's not a black black but more of a faded or brownish black which is really obvious with black leggings or jeans.
3138	"This is such an amazing take on a white blouse. it's fun and still polished! the fabric is so soft and so easy to dress up or down!  the arm holes run a little small but the cut of everything else is amazing."
3139	"I tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today. it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress, with very interestingly cut seams. the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract. gorgeous and high quality!  fit: i am 5'6"" and curvy, usually a size 14/16, and the xl fits quite roomy on me (that's the size i ordered because i like flowy things). so it definitely runs large. usually i have better luck with a-line dress shap"
3140	The colors and print are absolutely beautiful and i'm quite heartbroken that this suit just doesn't fit. i don't have a long torso but the v was just so plunging that i wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the backyard lounge chair in this bathing suit. no matter how much i tied the halter it still revealed a v halfway down to my naval. the strange thing is that there seemed to be too much fabric on top, lots of ruching and thicker straps than i would normally go for, and while i'm only around a b
3141	Have had a hard time finding comfy dresses appropriate but not too long for my 15 year old daughter. purchased this tunic in a regular xs and she loves it! she wore today with suede booties-very soft, cute and longer than many dresses sold for teens. she initially thought it was a winter sweater dress but i explained it is mostly cotton and would be a great transitional piece for spring and fall.
3142	These are gorgeous and not too short or too long which is oddly hard to find! they're mostly tts, but if you're between sizes i'd go up a size because the small was slightly snug on me and i'm a 4/6. i'm hopeful that they'll stretch a little with wear because i think the medium would be too loose.
3143	I am so happy i ordered this jumpsuit. it is exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. the fabric is light and it's very well made. great length for dressing up with heals or dressing down with flats. i love it!
3144	I like the warm neutral color of this piece and the figure-skimming shape with waist definition. it is a soft and warm layering piece. sadly, the sleeves were too long for me and have long zippers at the cuffs so rolling them up didn't work. i wish i had caught this piece while they still had my size in petite!
3145	"Nice dark indigo with minimal fading. medium denim thickness, with stretch. i bought size 25 and it is snug, but doesn't squeeze. my hip is 34.5"" and 28"" waist. love these. i will be getting them hemmed up to ankle length. i am 5' 5"" and find the little kick out at the ankle (from getting them shortened) to be very cute and classy. if you keep them full length to your shoe, they will have a slightly baggier bootcut look. these remind me of my point sur hightower straight leg jeans, with maybe an"
3146	"This is absolutely beautiful.  but i am only 5'6""and the dress hits my thigh about the same place as it does on the model. one lean over to pick up my purse off the floor and i will flash everyone.   so i am going to wear it with dark denim leggings and tall boots.   likewise i did not detect even a speck of black. to me it is navy and purple. i was wishing it had black because those are my favorite leggings but quite honestly i think you're going to have to do navy or denim."
3147	Nice jeans, just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them. that's why i returned them. otherwise, fine.
3148	Beautiful! soft, flattering but not clingy~ i bought in the green which is not a typical color in the summer palate which makes it all the more appealing.
3149	I love coats and have a collection of unique ones and this one is in my top 3! wow is it a stunner! totally different and very classy. not my every day coat but will be used for dinner outings and special occasions with the right outfit. i did reinforce the buttons since there had been many complaints about that, which is why i only gave it 4 stars for quality. great design on this one retailer!
3150	"I have the ""charisma sheath"" by the same designer and love it so much i thought i'd try this one. looks so much better in person than in the picture. it's extremely flattering on my curve less frame. whenever i wear it to work, i get stopped and asked where i got it. great dress, you'll love it more in real life!"
3151	I had different expectations for this shirt in blue and when i received the item it didn't met those expectations. the material is very good quality but there is nothing extraordinary about the shirt, it is jus very plain. this item is being returned.
3152	I'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are. i ordered the petite small, and i'm always a small. these are huge. i felt like i had on a large. i like the thin material and color, and i'm sad that they are so large.
3153	I purchased this in both the green color and the grey color and am in love with both. they are much longer than last years design and it has a pretty weave to the sweater with multiple layers that sit perfectly past the hips. the fit is true to size although the fabric is quite thin and i worry about pulls. also, the sleeves are a bit long, but this doesn't bother me too much at this point. very versatile!
3154	This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger, a nice blue, and a good transition piece. but, the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin, but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it, but sadly, i just don't think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms, i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work, but for me at least, i think it
3155	These shorts are divine. the fabric is sturdy and there is a weave of sparkle that i did not perceive from the picture.
3156	I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it, no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim
3157	I bought the tangerine version of this dress for my brother's summer wedding in the south, and i can't wait to wear it. cotton material has a touch almost like linen, but not rough. nice and hearty fabric. tangerine color is beautiful, more salmon than coral. wearing it with a little shoulder shrug and the laika inca shoes?the shoes aren't on the retailer site anymore, but i found them at my local store. just perfect.
3158	This dress runs so large, why did they not make an extra small. the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering. i wish wish that they made this in the extra small, i was swimming in it, there was no way to fix it so it went back
3159	This dress is a new favorite! the cut is great for most figures and the fabric has a nice drape around the curves of the body so it sort of has a slimming effect - which i love! i'm petite and curvy and so the hem lands closer to top of my knees than it does on the model in the image. the color in person is slightly more purple and less brown/maroon, but it still works for a fall/winter wardrobe. if you are uneasy about the colors, i recommend looking at it in store before purchasing. i love thi
3160	"I tried this tunic at a store and loved it. i had to buy a much bigger size because the sleeves are so narrow. the 12 fit ok but the sleeves are so tight it hurt. i have normal arms and i am so glad i was at a store to try a bigger size."
3161	I tried on the blue in store and ordered the red in petite, and they are both too long (which means i will have to hem). i am not sure if i want to spend the extra money on hemming so hanging on to them for now as i love hte cut and color. they fit like a glove otherwise (i do have muscular thighs). the 0p is good for me (115 lbs). can't go wrong for a nice pant, i can see wearing these out or for work...
3162	This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique, flowing, romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like, fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!
3163	I loved this dress and wanted to use it for work. i read the reviews and saw all the issues with the slip and was nervous, but i tried it anyway and figured i could use another plain black slip i have if the one with the dress didn't fit. i'm really happy i did because it's a gorgeous dress. you just may need to wear a different black slip with it (i did). if you already have one, it's no additional hassle or cost and the dress is really unique. it's the perfect comfortable but stylish dress for
3164	I love this top. i wear it all the time.  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade.  i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable.
3165	I always wear dresses because fl is hot. this one is easy breezy and fun. it's trendy without trying too hard. nice lines, the fabric is nice and soft and washes well. the pattern is pretty, i got both colors. i always get compliments when i wear this dress.
3166	This shirt is so soft and buttery! it fits tts and just as shown on the model. for the sale price, this shirt is a gonga! good go-to shirt on those days where you're just not sure what to wear. one thing that slightly bothers me about this shirt is that the arm holes are a bit loose, so you can see your bra. i think if you wear a black bra with it though, it would be fine.
3167	This dress is everything i love about retailer. a never-could-have-guessed-it, feminine, textured twist on a classic. it's beautiful, it's comfortable. the cut is true to size (for me) and figure flattering.
3168	This dress is very soft and comfy but transparency is an issue. having said that, i think as long as you wear flesh-colored undergarments you'd be fine in a casual situation. the natural fiber is especially comfortable and the detailed stitching around the neck and chest area is pretty. my store didn't have petite sizes and the regular length was too long for me so i passed on it.
3169	This is a great casual shirt that works great for a day at the beach and is also comfortable enough to wear to sleep. wore this shirt to school one day with an undershirt underneath and wore it again hiking several days later with just a sports bra underneath.
3170	"The light red color is so rich! i would describe it as a burnt coral/red. i love the length - long enough to pair with leggings, but not overwhelming in my 5'3"" frame. one sleeve began to unravel the first time i wore it, but i was able to mend it easily and have had no trouble since. i think it was a flaw specific to my sweater and not s general indication if poor quality. hubby says this is his favorite sweater on me too!"
3171	"Love love love this dress! have received so many compliments on it. i'm 5'4"", 118 and xs fit perfectly. love the cap sleeves and details, super comfortable too. i can see wearing this year-round and dressing it up/down."
3172	I really like this romper and i ordered it to fit my bottom. i'm a 6 on the bottom and 4 up top. i ordered a mp to cover the bottom and a petite for my height. it's a keeper but i will be belting or adding something to cinch it at the waist so that it has more of a shape.
3173	This is one of my favorite retailer dresses - it's flowy and makes me feel beautiful. i loved it so much that i bought it in two colors! it does run big, so i would size down but when you find your size, you'll love it!
3174	I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings, but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though.
3175	"Really like the quality, color, and overall design of these jeans. they ran a little long on me, but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties. i didn't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed. so, glad that was the case given the price tag on them. i am 5'7"", 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed. definitely recommend these jeans"
3176	"This is my first romper and i am in love.  so comfortable and easily dressed up or down.  i am usually an xs, small, or petite small in retailer brands.  the xs worked best for me.  the petite small was too big.  i am 5'2"" and the length of the xs is perfect ankle length.  i was nervous to put it in the washer on delicate cycle but it came out perfectly."
3177	This is a gorgeous top; however, it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?
3178	I purchased this sweater in grey to take on a fall european trip. it is very pretty without being overly frilly. a marled heather grey color. soft and warm without being too bulky. light enough to wear in the daytime but with enough coverage to transition into a cool evening. casual enough to wear over a tee or blouse with jeans yet sleek enough to pair with a skirt or dress. it is a roomy fit without being sloppy. i like things a bit loose and comfy - not too tight and am happy with the medium
3179	I ordered these online. i usually wear a 4-6 depending on the brand. i ordered the 6 and love the way they fit as i didn't want them tight. they have a lot of stretch and the fabric is nice quality.
3180	I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves, but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall, it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.
3181	I bought this because i loved it online but in person there is another level to the shirt that i did notice in another picture. i didn't like the second level on me since i am a shorter person. just didn't fit my body quite right.
3182	I purchased this with some hesitation, having read that some people thought it was unflattering. but i couldn't resist the sale price, and i love a low-maintenance work top and doesn't require ironing. this fits the bill perfectly. it's made of high quality fabric, there's a soft inner lining with a side zip closure, and it has a pretty narrow profile so initially i found it a little snug to wiggle into (i got a small), but once on it fit perfectly, and is so flattering i can't imagine why other
3183	Love this dress. it is so comfortable. it fits great and can be dressed up or down. hides the tummy, too.
3184	"I am 5'8"" and about 145 lbs - curvy through hips, small up top and i got a small and it fit great. i got it in the wine and it is a pretty color for fall into winter. the fabric is super soft and cozy!"
3185	I ordered the teal color - it is a beautiful color. the fit is a bit odd like one other person commented, but the pros outweigh the cons. i am thinking of ordering the other colors too.
3186	Love this top! tried it on in store...so glad i did since it runs large and i had to size down to a medium. the color is a beautiful camel and the material is soft...very grateful the fabric content did not contain dreaded wool, lol! therefore leaving it soft and comfortable to wear...the price tag was a bit much considering it is only a sweater vest but with retailer price equals quality so i don't mind spending the extra $!
3187	This over-sized sweater is light-weight and scratchy. i knew it would fit big, but the neck is overly bulky. the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture. fits a little larger (on me) than on the model. i'm petite so it overwhelmed me.
3188	I found this in your store and had to have it! i wore it on a date night and received more compliments than i can count!!!! the attention to detail makes this jacket special. i am 5 ft 5 inches 124lbs and a 4fits but a 6 is perfect for a sweater underneath. i actually went back a bought the other color. worth every penny.
3189	Just got this dress in an xl. i've never ordered from retailer before so i expected their clothes to run small. i was wrong. it's a beautiful high quality dress but i think it's just too big. i may end up exchanging it for a l. definitely size down in this dress!
3190	"I bought the tiny brand ""cassia"" tank last week in a small, and it fits beautifully. i ordered this ""sorcha"" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another."
3191	I eyed this for so long hoping it would go on sale. i finally bought it during the 20% off retailer members day. sized up from my usual size 4 to avoid the buttons on the bust looking like they were about to burst free. the rest still fits way. i absolutely cannot wait for the next rainy day to wear this!
3192	"I understand what the previous reviewer meant when she says these are great for around the house. the yarn is thick but the weave is open so they are nicely springy but not very warm.  they look perfect with my birkenstocks so i'm getting then in all colors."
3193	Very pretty design. hugs the body correctly. it's a little tight in the chest for me - i'm a 34c (large c) and i have some back chub so i'm using this fact to motivate me to get in shape for the spring. keeping the dress and hoping for a better fit in a few months.
3194	I got this when it went on sale (in navy and coral colors), awesome dress for any occasion! as far as complaints go about the straps, its meant to be low-cut! i really like the basket weave bodice although that does make it more difficult to zip up, but i found it was easier to just slip the dress on zipped up since the stretchy fabric gives quite a bit rather than deal with the zipper. i normally wear about a 0-2 in most retailer brands and have the dress in both sizes (didn't notice a big differ
3195	I ordered this online, and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head, therefore i couldn't even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress.
3196	I bought this top for work and going out.  it is a beautiful top that goes with many items in my closet like my red blazer, grey blazer, red cardigan etc.  it is very flattering.  the arm holes weren't too big.  fit tts.
3197	I was lucky enough to see this in store when it went on sale and although i rarely wear leather/vegan jackets i tried it on. i am torn on sizing i'm normally a m or 8/10 in retailer but the m fit slightly tight in the waist and the l was slightly loose. i ended up with the l in the moss color, since i can layer and don't really want the jacket too cropped. i also saw the brown and tried that on but for me the moss color was much richer.
3198	This sweater caught my eye while in the store shopping for a gift. i am on the shorter size so i was worried that it would drown me. it didn't! it hits me mid thigh. the sides are cut up high. i will wear a cami or shirt under it. super soft material. flattering fit. i have put on a little weight and this hides all the problem areas without looking frumpy. thanks
3199	"I was so excited to receive this jacket - have been looking for a ""leather"" jacket for a while and thought this would be the perfect one. unfortunately, i have broad shoulders and it seemed a little tight. i got my normal size s based on retailer shirts. maybe if i got the m? although, the s fit well in the waist, so... also, my small chest (32b) didn't fill out the darting in the chest area. one last wish, was that it was a little longer.  as with all hei hei, the inner lining was very cute. ove"
3200	"This skirt looks very nice in person and it hugs one's cure beautifully. the hem is uneven which makes it more interesting. i am 5'2"", 120lbs, tried it in the navy/beige color in size s and size xs, and i found size xs fits better. the fabric is soft and stretchy, and it drapes well. because i am petite, the length of the normal size fits me more like a maxi skirt (it goes all the way down to my mid calf). unfortunately, the petite xs is sold out, so i have to settle with the normal size xs. sti"
3201	I'm super into this top! i bought the evergreen color in store as it fit true to size and was very flattering. i went to buy an item that was available online only and decided to also buy this top in black. my favorite aspect about this shirt is that it can be dressed up or down. the material is slightly stretchy though it does not cling. i can wear a chunky necklace and dressy skinny pants and look ready for a nice dinner. on the other hand, this top can be thrown on with a pair of comfy jeans
3202	This dress ran small in the arms for me. when i returned it for a bigger size, the dress i got had a huge rip in the decorative threading on the back. i can't believe the product wasn't checked for flaws this huge before shipping. i asked for another one in the same size. we'll see if it, too, is defective
3203	I saw this in my local retailer styled with a tank top underneath and i fell in love and bought the combo right away. it is a vest, so it's not meant to be fitted, so i think sizing down is fine. i'm usually an xs/s in tops, i went with the xs in this, and j still get that relaxed look which is nice. this vest is great, very versatile, simple yet adds great style. it was a bit of a splurge for me but i'm happy i added it to my closet!
3204	When this piece arrived, i was surprised at how weightless it was. there are 2 layers to it, an underlayer and then a very fine silk toplayer together, the ensemble is incredibly light and it is almost as though i feel like i am not wearing anything at all. to take it home, i did have to kind of stuff it in my bag, and this caused some considerable wrinkles which are very difficult to get out (super stubborn( but i am pleased with the look of the garment. usually, i like the look of a dress that
3205	I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it, but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children's book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it.
3206	I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock, or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing, as i'm fairly skinny, but still curvy, and while i love my curves, i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this, however, is a godsend.
3207	Overall beautiful skirt, material is a little on the heavy and stiff side but still a really nice skirt
3208	I love this shirt. i wore it once and it is so cute on - the problem came from washing. i washed once and made sure i washed on gentle. i took it out of the washer and hung it to dry and noticed that there was now a tiny hole in the body of the shirt. i am planning to exchange this and hoping it doesn't happen again!
3209	"I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a ""t"". it's soft, pretty and covers my wide bottom well."
3210	This is a great staple for laid back weekend wardrobe. the inside of the pullover is soft, like sweatshirt material, and its comfortable enough to sleep in. also cute enough to wear out with jeans. i would definitely recommend this sweatshirt. i'm typically a size 0 in retailer - i ordered this shirt in a size 1 and i love the fit.
3211	Mine came smelling like gasoline. not sure why, but i would have kept it otherwise. it's a smell that will be really hard to get out. looks like the picture.
3212	This dress is very versatile. it is comfortable and very flattering. the armholes were not too big. you do need to wear a bra that crosses in the back if you do not want the straps to show. i purchased the red/pink color and it is very vibrant and not see through at all. the length is great as it is above the knee by a few inches, it accentuates the best part of the leg. it also can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or more casual with flatter shoes. it is a classic style, not trendy so it wi
3213	This is a cute dress, but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on. i can't risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it. especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup, anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle.
3214	I just bought the grey, and now i'm coming back for the black and cream i lovethis staple item!! so soft fits great!
3215	I was on the fence about this top, because i don't typically do longer tunic styles. however, it really is quite lovely. i paired it with long jeans, wedge sandals, and a delicate necklace - so pretty! it fits very nicely and i was surprised at how much i liked the length.
3216	Lightweight and cute. these pants do run on the larger side, which is fine is you like a more relaxed look. i usually wear a 10-12 in pants and i had to exchange the large for a medium which fit much better. great for summer weather!
3217	This is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk. i received many compliments when i wore this, with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry. the fit is true to size, i took my usual size l. it is longer on me than the model, and my only complaint is the slip-it is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together, so i had to find a different slip. i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer, i don't
3218	I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially, then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute, but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.
3219	I bought this to use over the holidays. it is extremely comfortable and i've received multiple complements. you can dress it up or wear it casual.
3220	I was really lucky to pick up these shorts during the tag sale, and they are great! lightweight, roomy in the legs (way more my speed, i prefer shorts that don't cling) and really soft. they also weren't too short. i am usually between two sizes at retailer, depending on the brand, and ended up going with the smaller size. they're not really a size too big, but would've been a little too roomy/baggy in the waist, had i not purchased the smaller.
3221	I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back.
3222	"I recommend this topper but with reservations. it is beautiful looking, especially the lace portion.  it is also very wide. the gathered portion is a complete design fail, it balloons up right below the bust, making one look wide and pretty ridiculous. it's obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body. but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise.  i ordered size s, the smallest available, and it fit very wide more like a"
3223	It was very pretty,but it ran very big , sadly i had to return it.
3224	This is a cute, fun addition to my wardrobe, especially since i am a polka dot fan! it is alittle short for me and i think it runs just a bit small, particularly if you want to wear like the model with longer shirt under it. overall, it was worth the sale price and will look good with casual pants, jeans and with dressier black pants for work.
3225	"Loved the idea of this top--but it just won't work for me. it's really big. i'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs. a small should be fine, but i'm swimming in this. the back is pretty (i tried it on with a white cami), but it looks very maternity on me. tried to order the xs, but it's sold out. too bad. was a cute idea. not too thin for summer."
3226	I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.
3227	I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.
3228	Super cute basic top but after washing it once according to tag instructions, it is pilling like a well-worn sweater would.
3229	This dress is super cute - and fits tts for retailer. i ordered my usual size small and it fit me great everywhere, however the arms are much shorter and hit me either wrong, or the model in the picture is just very,very small. i'm 5'10, 136#, 36aa, slim built and the dress fits, but the arms bunch up -- if i ordered a medium the entire dress would be too baggy (and it is a loose fitting shift). bummer, bc it is super cute! also, the material is loose crochet - my dress arrived with a pull. sad fa
3230	"I tried this on in the store as soon as i saw it because of it's ease, modern look, and my obsession with stripes and wrap skirts. i am between an 8 and 10 in retailer most of the time (although sizing has been quite erratic in the last couple of years), but picked up a 10 to ensure an easy fit. was so surprised to find you have to not only buckle (cute detail) but button and zip this ""easy"" skirt, and with all that there were also straps that buttoned that i believe are there to keep it from flyi"
3231	"I have worn this with skinny jeans and espadrilles untucked and with black linen shorts. i also wore tucked in with high waisted slim fit black pants,  i got compliments on all the looks. i think it's a fun and cheerful, feminine summer top.  i got mine on sale so i thought was a fair price for what it is. wouldn't have paid full retail.  requires ironing.  i am a size 4 and 5'3 and have a small."
3232	I bought this tunic to wear as a swim cover-up, last minute. but it has become my go to for wearing over skinny jeans. the length makes it so versatile, great layering piece.
3233	The only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big. i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for. i wouldn't say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect. still love it!
3234	This skirt is a great staple. i somewhat agree with the first reviewer that it is a little big but not huge. i bought a m which is my regular size and i have to have it shorten the length, but that is typical for me since i am very short, but i liked the waist and didn't feel like it was too big and i have a very small waist. i don't like tight elastic at the waist and this sat very comfortably on me. nice heavy material for the winter.
3235	Ordered this dress in an xs, that is the size i usually wear. this runs small, but not only that it is the way it is cut, very small through the hips, thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model, but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!
3236	Great fabric, great fit, great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!
3237	I love this dress but when i put it on i was aghast! the chest was tight and the body was voluminous!! added the pounds which no wants! best left to the waify girls.
3238	"I can't often turn down a white blouse, so this caught my eye online and then in person. i love the concept but found the top to be rather large despite it being an xs. i would have to size down to an xxs, which i'm not certain would be long enough on my 5'7"" frame. there was extra space in the armholes and space around the waist, even factoring in its flowy style. it's not worth it to me to order an xxs online since my store doesn't carry it."
3239	I just love this dress - so comfortable and flattering. maeve has had some great dresses this summer, but this one may be my favorite. this one could easily been worn in to fall with a sweater or jacket.
3240	"Cute design. runs big in neckline, falls off shoulder exposing bra straps. fabric is very thin. sloppy look on short petite frame. 5'1"" 142lbs 34-36 c/d. purchased a medium. haven't washed it yet, but the fabric doesn't look like it will hold up well. i have kept it to wear as a sleep shirt with thin gray sleep sweats."
3241	"It's a pretty, low-key, no fuss skirt. i prefer the ivory color because the details are more visible (there are different designs in the same hue). the zipper is very thick and sturdy, a bonus. size 2 regular fit me well, the hem falls right above my knees (i'm 5'2"", 26 waist, 36 hips), perfect for work and play. a touch of linen keeps the fabric cool for summer, but it doesn't wrinkle. for the price and the name like ""thera,"" i expect more flair to match its mediterranean name. for those who do"
3242	The dress is pretty, i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran, i took both back the neck is too tight!
3243	I love this dress! i was trying on some dresses in the store and the sales girl put this one in just for fun. i would have never picked this dress out. i didn't look awesome on the hanger. but i tried it on anyway and i ended up getting two other dresses at that time. but i couldn't stop thinking about how much i loved the way i looked and felt in this dress. so i did what any girl would do and bought it online. it took me a while to find it online because the picture on line doesn't do the dres
3244	I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately, some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost, this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.
3245	"I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably won't look good on a shorter person if it is still available when the price comes down, i might buy it."
3246	Nice quality fabric and design, but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
3247	I bought one of these tees and i washed it a few times and luckily no holes yet like other reviews have stated. i just got a 2nd tee as they are quite comfy. i bought these both in-store but the petite size might have been better for my frame. i wish retailer would look into having petite sizes available in store and not just online. sometimes i do get lucky on finding petite sizes in-store, but it's usually from a return.
3248	"I like the jeans a lot. they're definitely skinny fit and more like leggings -- very stretchy. i feel like they would fit all shapes and sizes because of that ""give,"" so the claim that they're flattering on everyone is probably valid. i also appreciate that there is no stonewashing, as grey jeans often seem to have -- they are all one hue from top to bottom, with a little bit of linear line texture to the fabric. the only flaw (at least i don't think it's intentional) is that the front pockets l"
3249	This skirt is unique yet versatile and gorgeous. everything about this skirt works: dazzle balanced out with softness and midi length. the twirly width shows off the skirt in a subtle way, and super comfortable. no petite 2 left so i purchased a regular 2 and it fits perfectly (i am 5ft2in, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls about 2in. longer than shown on the model. this skirt is sold out fast, no surprise. it flatters all body types at all ages. get ready for lots of compliments!
3250	"I am 5' 7"" with an athletic build (small chest, small waist, muscular hips/thighs). this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am. i purchased a small, an extra small would be way too short. i could see how it works for fuller figured girls."
3251	I love the way the dress fit definitely a flip flop by the poolside bar dress. i ordered the mango colored one and was disappointed that the color resembled a dark squash orange and not as bright as it looked in picture. i think it will look nice with a tan so i will keep it. wouldn't plan to dress it up too much because it will definitely wrinkle ! i am a petite 5'4 and got the regular and it fits just above my knees which is good for my taste!
3252	Just purchased this on sale. will be perfect for summer on those days you wear dresses and don't want your skin to touch the subway bench! love it!
3253	Saw this in the store and loved it! the photos on line do not do this justice. material is soft and substantial. if you love the look of raw edge you'll love this piece. as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only 5' but kept it and love it.
3254	I ordered this in black and in the print and i am super happy with both. the fabric is very soft. i've worn it with denim and khaki shorts as well as with a cute skirt for work. very versatile.
3255	Got this today and am really pleased. beautiful detail and i love how the cowl neck hangs. it's not itchy at all. overall, a great find for the colder months ahead. i got a small and probably should have ordered xs  instead. runs a little big on my petite frame.
3256	So different than anything in my closet. it's wide with a beautiful drape. fabric is soft but substantial. it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves. i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size. so cute on.
3257	I am writing a review even though this is currently sold out (and was just released). what i love: the fit: snug, not too tight, and xs is true to size in the sense of historically. the wasit is cinched in, ample room in the chest. the fabric is substantial (thick and sturdy) and not prone to wrinkle, based on me having it in the bag in the hot car) and no false pleats was created. the sleeves are fun and different, may be a bit much for some. it is in multiple pieces, why it flutters so nicely.
3258	"This is a fantastic maxi -- it is very flattering, you can wear a normal bra with it (for me, very necessary) and the added ruffle makes it perfect. its a casual fabric but because of the contrast in fabric can be dressed up easily.   i am 5 foot 1, 123, and curvy on top and ordered a small petite. in many antrho maxis i go down to an xs, but in this one the small felt the best -- more comfortable around the waist.   will get tons of wear out of this -- have already taken it on a trip and wo"
3259	I got this shirt in light blue. i absolutely love it. i just bought it for the summer and i wore it on a day where it was 85 and it was just perfect. it is a very light material and it's very flowy so it breathes very well. i got an xs. i am 5'6 and it fits just perfectly. highly recommend!
3260	Corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit well....even with stretch added. so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif mid-rise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great! they were long enough as well. i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived, it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones. how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well. these are not old lady pants either...how nice!
3261	I absolutely love this top. i'm always either an x-small or 0/2 in mauve. i think this top runs small. i tried on an extra small and it was too tight in the chest. i'm average in bust.
3262	I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material, yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7, 130 pounds, athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans.
3263	Runs a little small, but is very chic!!! you can wear it with jeans and a white t-shirt and you are going to look awesome!!!
3264	I was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party, i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model (i am a more typical 50 year old mom body) and i have never worn a peplum style. i put it on for my husband and approved, so i wore it. i received many compliments - a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my 'comfort zone' with the style!
3265	This is one of my favorite.it is timeless for sure.
3266	I really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy. i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same, boxy but shorter so i decided to pass.
3267	"Failed to read website description that vest is polyester shearling-lined.that's on me.  beware: pockets decorative only.  runs a size small due to fact vest is polyester shearling-lined."
3268	"I bought these in the olive green, in the store and will be ordering the gray pair online. i am 5' 9"" and 145 lbs, long legs and these are beyond adorable. some people mentioned that they stretched out? i did not find this to be true. what i do know is they can be dressed up or dressed down. they are flattering and perfect for the spring/summer. i would highly recommend and would/will purchase in every color. well done retailer!! one of my most favorite purchases so far this spring."
3269	Love the way these pants fit. love the length. love the cut! just the right amount of flare... normally i am a 28 or 29 in citizens jeans. i considered the 27 in them, but the legs were a bit tight. 28 was just about perfect. and the best part....they are finally on sale. i look forward to wearing them with flats or heels and a simple white shirt!
3270	I bought this in the black and white and like it a lot. i typically wear an xs or s, and purchased the small. glad i did because i think the xs would have been too snug. i like the tunic length and the fabric feels soft and smooth. it's a little low cut for me, but i'll wear a cami under it.
3271	Absolutely love this sweater! it is a tad bit large. i bought it in a medium but because i like the loose fit i will keep it. it is very light and great for the summer. i've only worn it once so far and received many compliments on it. great quality as well!
3272	This is my first pair of mcguire jeans, and i like the fabric and fit.  thank goodness for petite sizing!  these 32p fit just right on my hips, with no gap between the waistband and my body.  fits through thigh and hips and pretty slim all the way down.  nice stretch.  of course, the proof will be after wearing a few times and washing.  i will update my review if i do not like them so much after that,
3273	Flattering fitted form. flowing fabric. well made. colors are true to pictures.
3274	These would have been the perfect black pants! great cut, love the wide band in the front, true to size, quality construction. but a zipper in the back?!!! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up. perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller, but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on. sending them back, since i don't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need.
3275	Saw this in the store but didn't have my size. ordered online- wore it twice already and got so many compliments! very current and flattering!
3276	This is by far one of my favorite dresses i have tried on in a long time. i am a 2-4, the small was tts and so flattering. i think this would be better for someone taller with a lean frame, though its not super tight and the material has a great weight to it, it isn't lined and could definitely show figure flaws. for me it skims my body elegantly and was very comfortable through the bust, waist and hip (34c/26/36). it fits me like the model in the image. the one down side is that it is pullover
3277	I love the coh fleetwood jeans, and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans, i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods, which are a substantial weight denim, these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in, these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.
3278	I like this dress a lot, the fabric is nice, the necklines are unusual and flattering but there is definitely some added volume at the hips with the pockets. really comfortable dress.
3279	I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today, and while the fit was great, i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather, i'm sure. i liked them, but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive, i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work, but sadly, back they go.
3280	Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color.
3281	Super flattering and lovely material. dress-up or down. they run true to size.
3282	I really like this top! it's lightweight, great quality, and i've worn it for casual weekend outings and also dressed up for work.
3283	I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5'6 120 and usually a s fits. however, this was really tight. also, the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one.
3284	"As soon as i saw this dress i ordered it...i didn't want to miss out on it. i loved the look...the colors were so fun and bright...i thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii. i am 5'4"" about 118#. i ordered a pxs. when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric. i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful. part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c"
3285	This caught my eye, purely by accident as i was in the dressing room. immediately attracted to the pattern, the color, the quality and the shape of the skirt. lo and behold, it turned out to be maeve, one of my favorite designers at retailer. this skirt does not disappoint at all. i normally try to wait for sales to make a purchase, but this is well worth the full retail price. the skirt is very well made. the material is structured but not stiff. i also don't normally like high waisted ski
3286	Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size. i am either a large or xl. i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size. first, the top is huge. i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely. the rest of the top was like a large tent. the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking. in fact, in the store, it was displayed with a jacket over it. online, the orange looks completely different,
3287	"I purchased these pants on-line in my usual size petite 4 and they were a perfect fit for me. i have a 27"" waist, 35"" hips and i'm 5'4"" and found them to be a little long but not so much that i want to hem them as i'll be wearing these with my clogs and platforms anyway. if i want to be able to wear them with flats, i'll need to hem them but i bought them to go with my higher shoes so it's no bother. these are very slimming pants and zip up at the back. they are a tad difficult to zip up but not"
3288	This sweater is so lovely, i bought it first in navy and then came back for it in grey. very soft and comfortable. the back doesn't wrinkle the way you might think it would from the pics alone. very flattering. i highly recommend it!
3289	Gorgeous lace detail on this classic swimsuit. absolutely love it! fits true to size.
3290	Great job from the fabricators in creating such a gorgeous print on light-as-air silk! i'm so happy with the dress and can stare at it for hours, that's how pretty it is. the fit is perfect on me and disguised my figure flaws since it's an a-line skirt that doesn't cling. yes, the skirt is sheer and unlined and for the price a slip should have been included. fortunately i own a silky half slip that complements nicely. i'm a top heavy 36dd, large rib cage, 140# with a square waist and no hips and
3291	When i first tried it on, i was worried it would add 10-15 lbs to my hourglass frame, but if worn correctly, it actually has a flattering, slimming effect. i recommend wearing it open (like in the photo) with the same type of outfit underneath...looks very chic! or, to give yourself a defined waist, use the provided ribbon belt tied to the side or use your own large, statement belt. also looks great with vintage sunglasses! the fabric quality can't be beat. it's nice and heavy to the touch. i ca
3292	I bought the white tee. while the print is nice, the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).
3293	I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d, and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny, the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer
3294	This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more. it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days. it fits tts. well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay ( as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with). the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail.  sure to sell out.
3295	The colors and design of this skirt are beautiful. the fabric hangs nicely. the color i more burnt orange than red. i ordered my usual size (6), but it is too small.
3296	This dress has a great design for any frame. it looks great with a belt to accentuate the waist but the dress stands great alone and doesn't require a lot of styling.
3297	"I saw a stylist wearing a similar piece from a few seasons ago and commented that i liked it on her. i was told they had a different version (a few actually) and i decided to try it on. it actually is pretty flattering, i had flared jeans on but also could see it with a dress. i left it open, as pictured, tied one button, and also played with the neck and tried a cowl... all very nice.  i debated getting my usual xs petite, but hey, they don't make it in petite, and the stylist thought the loo"
3298	"Cute, easy fitting dress. i got it in orange, which is a summery, pretty print. i ordered it in petite because i am 5'1"", but the dress is very short, so i'm exchanging it for a regular size. if you're average height, be aware that the dress will be well above the knee."
3299	I actually found this blouse to be quite nice. i'm not sure that i'd wear it as a tunic, though. it looks great tucked in and the print is fun but nothing exhilarating. for the price, i expected more.
3300	Pilcro from retailer is a great alternative to the premium denim lines with a way better price point! similar cut & quality with awesome rises and spandex/stretch content! also, the styles are always on trend!
3301	"I love this dress. i typically do not like or wear dresses often, and definitely not this style. i'm glad i tried something different. i received numerous compliments on how flattering and attractive it is. yes the belt is only in the front, but i cinched it very tight and it pulled the back in. i bought size s. it was very form fitting in the top and waist, and not too big through the hips. i have a 38"" bust and i can button all the top without pulling. i wore it with black tights and high brow"
3302	Great light weight sweater. perfect for spring. runs true to size. definitely will buy another color.
3303	In my retailer this was hung over in the pj section, and it really has more of a jammie top feel... soft, thin and stretchy. it's super cozy and comfortable and it drapes really nice. mine seems to have stretched out a little, especially the neckline (and the little buttons have a hard time staying closed). i'm happy with it though for what it is - a great, casual day t.
3304	This vest looks exactly as in pictures which is a good thing for online exclusives. i love the fact that it's lined and the texture and color of the fabric is very nice. has a good, solid quality feel to it. it does not have any buttons or belt that comes with it but looks perfectly fine just left opened. i wore it with belt as well and it add to the structured styling of the vest. more on the conservative side of retailer.
3305	I've been waiting for this to go on sale, and just picked one up in store. the details and style of this blouse do not disappoint! since it's billowy in nature, a size smaller fits me perfectly.
3306	I took this in a large. im a 36d 140lbs. this top in a large fit me perfectly without a bra. slightly see through but not by much... i haven't tried it with a bra on yet, but im sure it'll be just fine.
3307	"Loved these culottes! flattering fit and nice drape. the fabric, though poly, is of a nice weight and swishes nicely as you walk. the length (just below knee length) works for me too. the color is lovely for the fall - rich copper and easy to pair . i'd say these are tts but if in doubt, size down. i""m between a size 8-10 and the 8 works best for me."
3308	This skirt was placed next to the gallery skirt (corduroy skirt) and i thought it was the same until i touched the fabric and realized it was denim. the material is not the average stiff jean type but much thinner cotton material. i am surprised that this skirt is now released because i feel that it should have belonged to the summer collection. i think it is a nice basic casual skirt if you need one. kudos for the unique buttons, the first button is decorative which stands out from the rest of
3309	I sized up to an xl and although they have everything you want in a yoga/lounge pant, they just didn't thrill me enough to keep them. they're soft, warm and comfy but i didn't care for the bulk or fit of the foldover waistband. and they were too long so i returned. if you're built like the model, you'll love these.
3310	This dress is so beautiful! i ordered it online and when i received it i was so pleased with how it was even better in person. the fit, the embroidery, the lovely fall colors - makes this a perfect dress all the way around!
3311	This shirt is nice and flowy. it can be dressed up or down. very lightweight for summer, but the color will work for early fall too.
3312	Love this top...bought in 2 colors...white and the orange. fun change to regular t-shirts....sized down because its flowy.
3313	This is a great, effortless top. you can dress it up or down and fits true to size. it's forgiving and the straps draw your eye to the most flattering part of the body. the fabric is stretchy and and comfortable.
3314	I really wanted to love this. i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock. i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer. unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange. it cut my off in the most unflattering spot.
3315	I bought this top to wear this fall, and it does not disappoint. it's a heavier light knit and the pattern is subtle but really pretty. i ordered a size smaller than i usually wear so that i can wear it on or off the shoulder, making this great for work.
3316	The dress is  very feminine and very flirty. i love orange/melon-colored dresses. this one does not disappoint. it does run extremely small around the rib cage. i had to size up to a 6 when i typically wear a 2 or 4. my bra size is 32 b. nice quality fabric, lined, with built-in bustier.
3317	I could seriously sleep in this--it's that soft! i dressed this with a white tee and holey jeans then i wore it to work today over a blue midi dress. love this jacket!!!
3318	"Such a cute skirt! the fabric is comfortable and light, and the the tie in the front helps conceal some of those ""tummy issues"" a lot of people want to hide. :)"
3319	I'm pregnant (2nd trimester) and really wanted a beautiful, non-maternity dress. i got this in ivory and it's just perfect. the lace on the sleeves is really comfortable, i love the fit, and i love the length. i got tons of compliments on it. my only regret is that i didn't also get it in slate and i really wishing it would get re-stocked.
3320	This was really billowy but not in a good way. i had to return it. looks great in the photo but not so much in person.
3321	In love! just wow. beautiful colors although they're dark you can still see all the variations. the flannel is light and not too heavy. there's visible black lace just below the shoulder. pretty buttons. ordered the large, my normal size and it's a perfect fit. roomy but not oversized. so well made i think this will be a favorite for years.
3322	This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!
3323	"Wow... i'm in love!!! when i first saw this i put it in my cart... when i went back to purchase it, it was sold out in my size... i was so bummed. i kept checking back and saw it was restocked so i quickly ordered it... thank heavens!!! when i first took it out of the box i thought it might be too ""grandma-y"" of a design... but i was wrong. it's just gorgeous! can totally be dressed up or down. so flattering. love love love it!!!"
3324	"I love the idea of this coat and foolishly purchased other items in happy anticipation of its arrival.  the description does not say ""lined,"" and i hoped for soft wool that i recently got on the ""yellow with white piping"" sweater coat. this is hard, coarse, itchy wool - impossible for me to wear an unlined garment. i am consistently puzzled by the high prices for garments that are unlined when they really need to be. it went back, and i cannot really recommend this as i know i am not the only"
3325	Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did. i wasn't crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model. i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly. crisp and clean is how i would describe it. launders well. fits great. drape is perfect. wear tucked in or out - can't go wrong.
3326	I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however, the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.
3327	I had been eyeing this top for awhile and decided to get it when it went on sale. it is a very nice top. i'm going to pair it with jeans and boots for our florida fall but could see it working with a nice pair of pants. it is roomy so if you're looking for something more fitted than i would pass on this top.
3328	This coat is truly gorgeous in person. it's an investment coat, one that i will probably wear for years to come because the style is timeless and the color is lovely. i found it to be very high quality. in fact, i would love to see more coats of this caliber from retailer. the other reviews had me hesitant to splurge on it, but i don't plan on wearing it buttoned very often so that will be a non-issue for me. the lining is one of the best parts of the coat! show it off! i think the problem
3329	"I loved this dress so much i bought in the cream/pink as well as the blue/teal. it is so light and easy to throw on. the slits are higher on me (i am 5'2) but not in a risquã© way. it's very flattering and gives it a little sassiness.  i wish they had even more colors to choose from. that is how obsessed i am with it!"
3330	"It is a pretty dress but not what i had hoped for (i ordered it online.) i like slits on sleeves but the dress doesn't fit me well, so i plan to return it. p.s. it has pockets! :-)"
3331	I really wanted to love this dress, but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless, but it didn't work for this short,
3332	Better than a regular boring cardigan. goes with short sleeves and dresses!!
3333	Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.
3334	Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend.
3335	This top is very light weight and comfortable. i am normally a 8/10 in tops due to my bust size but ordered a 6 based on other reviews. it fits great. i really like the fit and the pattern. it has been a great summer shirt and i can see myself grabbing for it in the fall paired with skinny jeans and a cute bootie.
3336	This is a nice everyday jacket to wear with dresses, jeans, skirts, anything. i ordered the only color that had petite left, the plum. i liked it, but the fit was a little boxy, even as xs petite. length was nice, however. color was also a nice neutral, though it says plum, it is a darker brown. for reference, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs - review on xsp.
3337	I love this piece !   i purchased it on sale months ago and when  i wear it i just love it!!  it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect it's very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing  i'm very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine  would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices   thx retailer!
3338	"This shirt is a great deal on sale,i would not pay full price.i got it in the honey color and it is really cute. this shirt does run very large. i normally wear a small or size 4 to 6 and i was lost in a size 6. i went with a size 2 and it was perfect for sizing purposes i am a 34c and 5'3"" 112lbs..shirt is a bit lightweight so it is nice for summer or year round."
3339	This is just okay for me. the top is soft and surprisingly flattering, especially from the side, but the front rides up and the neckline never lays flat. it washes well and the tan/white combo is cute, but a little transparent.
3340	This twist front top fits true to size, it is perfect! i really love the ruched sides, i like a longer tankini but most of them the stomach area is too wide and flowy. this one is perfect, it hugs your sides and looks great to wear with my kids but still flirty with my husband! i got the navy top and the side tie bottoms in navy/periwinkle and they are so cute together, can't wait to hit the beach!!
3341	This top is amazing!! i thought it looked really cute in the photos but it's even cuter online. the material is great and you can't go wrong with the fit. i love tops that are loose and flowy, so when i'm feeling a bit bloated i can still look cute in tops. this one is definitely a must!
3342	The top is nice, good quality, etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.
3343	The top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy.  it also feels cheap to the touch.  i love the idea but can't keep it for this price...i'm a shorty so i'd have to hem it too! sadly will return.
3344	If i could sew, i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however, this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well), but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of
3345	I really love cloth & stone, and this top did not disappoint. i am usually a size small in tops but tend to be an xs in halters because the arm holes are usually big on me. i went with my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it has a nice drape to it and is super soft. i will add that when looking at the picture, i didn't notice that there is a muted pink to the plaid design. i originally thought it was just a navy blue and white plaid. however, there is a really light pink to it as well. i actually w
3346	I have been searching for these pants my whole life. i have them in several colors. i wear the moss most often. i'd recommend your normal size or size down if in between sizes. they stretch a bit as you wear them. one other thing- after being washed and dried the color has lightened significantly.
3347	Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however, after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater, but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.
3348	"This is the most perfect dress i've ever bought. i'm 5'8"" and the length was perfect. the cut is flattering and very slimming. the fabric is gorgeous and the pattern is stunning. please offer more dresses in this cut!!"
3349	What a perfect summer dress! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it's perfect. the slip is a little snug on the hips, but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger. i can't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer!
3350	I love the way these pants feel on. they are so comfortable and breezy. i love that i can feel cool in the summer without showing a lot of skin. i purchased both colors; both are very nice looking. that said, i'm not sure if i will keep them. they wrinkle something terrible. i'm pretty casual person and it even bothers me. it probably wouldn't be so bad if there weren't pleats in the front. after sitting for just a few minutes the pants look like a disaster in front. my husband said it's not ext
3351	Pretty, easy-to-wear dress. loose fitting. i am typically a size 4, size 4 fit, but i might have been able to go to a size 2 if i wanted it to be more fitted at the chest/arms.
3352	"This tank is fairly soft and fits true to size. i like that i can pick between a v or round neck, depending on my outfit. it truly offers a profile to layer with anything. the only complaint i have is that the edging wears faster than the rest of the tank. i've trimmed some pilling off of it to keep it looking neat. otherwise, this is one of my favorite tanks, and i have purchase two more so i can always find one when i want it.   this tank has some stretch, so i imagine it fits a range of siz"
3353	This is a lovely jacket. i thought it was going to be thicker, but it's so classy and chic. i got several comments on it, and i've only worn it once! great jacket to have in my closet. i can wear it to work, to dress up an outfit for school, or to complete an outfit.
3354	I had never worn pilcro jeans, and i took a chance and ordered without trying them on. i couldn't be more pleased! i wear a 26, but it is often difficult to find a good fitting pair of jeans. these fit comfortably and don't feel too tight, but are fitted enough to look great. i like the little bit of extra room around the top, allowing the jeans to feel comfortable. i'll be back for more pilcro jeans!
3355	I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down, but i bought it online, so i just decided to live with it. pretty top, though i do think it runs large.
3356	"Loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape.  looks great on. the tie in front adds to the dress.   i love to wear with tan knee-high boots."
3357	I happened upon this in my local store despite the fact that it is an online exclusive. i love finding returns so i can see them in person. i loved the soft colors right away. my hesitation was the standup collar but it actually folds down just fine and gives the vest lapels too. it also looks nice belted, left slightly open. i usually wear small or xs in tops and the small fits nicely. it doesn't need to close since there are no built-in fasteners. i will wear it with a long button down shirt o
3358	I like this top and agree that it does run large. i find the fabric to be somewhat heavy which i consider a good thing as it will hang nicely and do a good job of hiding *imperfections*. it does have a pleat in the back which is not so apparent in the photo here. i love the neckline... a slight bit of a *v* neck.
3359	"I purchased the pink top and really like it. it will be a ""go-to"". the material is light but not skimpy, and it has a nice drape to it. the length is good for me (5'4"") and it fits tts."
3360	I have several pairs of ag jeans and am always pleased with them. i had to get these when i saw them in the store. i'm a sucker for cuffed jeans in the spring. i also love the dark wash. i was surprised when i tried on my usual size 27 that they were too tight. i ended up going with a size 28. for reference i am 5'4, 122 lbs.
3361	"I couldn't resist the toucan print when i saw this online, and ordered in my normal size s (27/4 in pants, 34b bust, 5'7""). the fit is perfect - arm holes are an appropriate size (not huge like some dresses), semi-fitted and flattering, nice length for work, and the tie front is a nice detail to help define the waist. length is about the same as the model shot. i knocked off a star for quality since the fabric is not particularly breathable for summer and the zipper is a little tough in the wais"
3362	The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely, but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack, i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down, but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference, i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.
3363	This is my third byron lars and as usual it is absolutely gorgeous and so worth the price. it completely flatters the body and all the details add so much interest, creating a very unique dress.
3364	I really love how comfortable and versatile this dress is. the midi length is perfect for booties or flats, and the cowl neck is loose and fluid, so it lays well. the only complaint i had, and it's minor, is the tulip skirt doesn't stay closed well when i walk or sit, which reveals more inner thigh than i am comfortable showing. i have to be very mindful of the skirt all day (i teach high school).
3365	"I love cloth and stone and the softness and prettiness of this fabric did not disappoint. this is not a dress, however. it is a long shirt. the sides were so short the you could see where my bum and hamstrings came together. leggings would ruin the look and as a shirt it would be totally impractical. for reference i am 5'8"" and 130 lbs. the small was the correct size, save for the length."
3366	"I have a shorter torso and so i usually love dresses that hit right at my waist- so this dress seemed perfect!  i ordered a size 2 petite, which fit very well. the regular two (in picture) was not as well made. the straps didn't fit as well. they were less of an ""x"" and way more fabric. petite fit great. i think this dress is really fun but not very mature. i returned it because it didn't feel adult enough for the event."
3367	I loved this purchase. the dress is beautiful. it?s classy, very feminine and rich-looking. the colors and fabric are exactly as shown on a picture. it is tailored and non-stretch, so size has to be right. i am between 6 and 8 and my size m dress fits well. had to spend time shopping for a belt as the dress definitely needs one. gorgeous dress!
3368	These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for, and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim, but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse, but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants.
3369	Super comfy, easy to put on, and super cute! you can dress it up and dress it down! i'm usually a size s and the small fits fine, but i think the xs would have fit better.
3370	Unique, sophisticated and versatile summer dress that you will fall in love with. dress it up with heels for a night at the gallery or dress is down with a denim jacket for an easy day look. it needs no accessories. this silk dress is soft and it lays beautifully. you will want to wear it all summer long. fits tts. love it!
3371	"I'd say these are exactly as-pictured and i'm happy with them. they run a little big in the waist; i most often wear xspetite in retailer sizes, and can often wear xs regular but these are a bit loose (i have a 26"" waist, 34"" hips). the drawstring tie solves that of course but it's only in the front, it doesn't go all the way around the waist, the rest is elastic. i'd also say these are high-rise, or long in the crotch (but i'm only 5'3"" so they're probably mid-rise on tall people). i have them hi"
3372	Don't size down, as one reviewer recommended. you'll wind up trying to exchange. the colors are beautiful and the front panel has a lot of texture. it's a great find.
3373	This skirt is true to size and very comfortable on! the colors are beautiful and deep! so glad i snagged this on sale! it will be a great piece to dress up or down depending on where i am going! love it! get it while you can!
3374	Love these pants. the design is totally different and that is what i love! i paired these with the velvet red shoes from this site - also on sale. for me these ran true to size.
3375	I saw these in the store and was smitten. ordered online and have not been disappointed. love the pattern, the feel, and the fit. comfortable, fun and interesting. the regular length ones are definitely full-length on me but not too long. i might have gone with the petite length except that they didn't seem available, but am perfectly happy with the regular length.
3376	"Stunning, beautiful, elegant, comfortable and all silk!  the print is very mesmerizing, as are all the hemant & nandita pieces i own.  i'm shocked that there aren't more reviews.  i found this fit perfectly on my body, skimming over my flaws and keeping my temperature moderate.  i am 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 and purchased size mp.  please retailer, offer the other versions of this dress as shown on the uk retailer site."
3377	I ordered xs/petite but i think i better ordered xxs which was already sold out at the time i purchased. i recommend one size smaller for this sweater. this sweater is designed very wide for your shoulder which could be fallen down for people who usually prefer petite size but it's really adorable!!
3378	"This super cute skirt has a beautiful drape and overall fit. i was afraid the tie at the front would emphasize my slight tummy, but to the contrary, the skirt is flattering and slimming. at 5'3"", the front of the skirt hits at my upper to mid knee. 118 lbs., 26"" waist, 36"" hips, size 2 regular is a perfect fit."
3379	The cream color in this dress is divine. such a stunning dress that can be worn with a vest, jacket or alone. it looks very luxe and expensive in the cream color. because it's a knit, can go smaller in size. i tried on both the x-small and small. opted to go with the x-small. found it fit better.
3380	I really love this brand and i love the fit of this blazer. my bottons were loose on this jacket and i got the rose color too and i do agree with the other reviewer that the color is more terra-cotta. great for spring and cool summer night. it runs tts im a 36dd and the medium fit nice.
3381	Love these.they are a lovely gauzey cotton so they actually feel light. they do have volume however i don't believe they make you look bulkier though i suppose that depends on body type and how they are styled on top (i first wore with a form-fitting sleeveless chambray button down). that said, i sized down which meant the waistband was really too snug and so i sewed the button over to allow more room, which is why i gave them four stars. they have an elegant retro feel, versatile for spring and
3382	"I'd give this dress 6 stars if i could, it's possibly the best dress i've bought at retailer in 12 years of shopping there.  the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage  for anyone with a bit of a tummy. the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly (even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear), the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch, the fit is true to size, the pattern is bohemian and elegant -- not hippy dippy at all. i'm 5'6"""
3383	This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin, and this style of top is usually quite flattering, but this one missed the mark big time.
3384	"My first review and first full price designer denim purchase....  i recently lost weight and in need to replace all my pants and in search of a dark wash high rise jeans (preferably in black), finally decided to buy this at full price online coz of all the fab reviews. i decided to purchase the 25p, thinking that i may return after receiving it in the mail since i wasn't able to try at the store and not sure if i got the right size, also it's not the high rise denim that i was looking for. but t"
3385	The fabric is very soft and the fit is formed to the body. low cut, so may want to pair with a cami. great basic for work!
3386	This dress is very cute on. very flouncy. i know it looks like a gingham dress, but it's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern. the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size (bug or small), and i am larger on top, so i don't know what would happen with someone with a small chest. i wouldn't have minded if it did the same thing on the front, but it was just the back.
3387	$78 for a pair of sweats seems like a lot of money, but not when you consider the amount of wear you will get out of these pants. they are thin and a little on the long side, but very flattering. plus, the thin material makes them perfect for summer nights. i love the pockets. not a big fan of the tie on the front, but that's just a personal preference. i won't just be wearing these on the weekend. i found lots of fun tops and jackets in my closet that will turn these pants into something i'll b
3388	I ordered this pullover in green, size large. the color is lovely and the fabric feels great. however, it was tight (even though i often wear a medium). unfortunately it will be going back.
3389	I tend to size up when ordering tops online as i find a lot of retailer stuff to be inconsistent. a little big is better than something way to small. well that was a mistake with this top. i sized up and it was much too large everywhere, more so than i thought it would be. but the neck, there's no button or hook and i could barely get the top over my head! if i had gotten a size smaller i wonder if it would have ripped as i pulled it on. cute top, material is so-so.
3390	I purchased the teal suit and it was so beautiful! it's super comfortable and has nice coverage. i decided to return it because, as a nursing mom i've decided to wait until i've weaned the baby so i can make sure the fit is still good. but otherwise i would have kept it!
3391	Love love this skirt! quality is great and so comfortable. you can even do this skirt with boots and sweater in colder months! so glad i got it!!
3392	"I wanted to love this jumpsuit. it looks adorable in the product photo. i am 5'5"" about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me. i tried everything--- pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line, wearing a variety of heel heights----i couldn't seem to make it work. there was just so much fabric on me! it felt like i was wearing pajamas (and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out' way). i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut. on me, this jumpsuit was just"
3393	I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso, this would work great. if not, unfortunately, its not great - tear
3394	"I went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress, and i'm so glad i did. the fit was perfect. i'm always a little hesitant about long dresses since i'm 5'2"", but the petite length was perfect. the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable, but i feel elegant in it. i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month."
3395	I had my eye on this coat for so long. when i saw it was on sale and an extra 30% off i decided to go for it. i ignored the reviews that said it ran big and took a chance and sadly it did not pay off. this jacket is very heavy so if you are going to get it on sale, it will probably go into the closet for next winter. it was very boxy on me and tied at the waist, made my upper half look huge. it was just not flattering at all. the heaviness of it also made the big open neck a little annoying and
3396	Walked in intending to purchase another jacket and ended up leaving with this one. the color is advertised as grey, but it's actually more like a light mocha. the slightly darker fabric on the side and around the waist accentuated my curves and i believe it would help give the illusion of an hourglass figure to those who are more straight and slender. i generally wear a size 12 and m or l size tops depending on the designer. i purchased the l in this case because that's all that was available at
3397	I love floreat and was excited to find this top on sale. i received multiple compliments the first day i wore it. it is true that it might be better with a bit less fabric but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. the flowy shape it ideal for summer.
3398	"I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece, and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear, but for me, there were a few challenges.  first, the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style, cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th"
3399	"This dress is gorgeous in person. it is so much softer than it appears the photo and the fabric moves well. what you can't see from the picture is that the bodice sort of overhangs the skirt by an inch or so which is really nice for accentuating a small waist and separates the top from the bottom in a cool way.   i am 5'6"" 135 lbs and curvy. 36-26-39 for reference. i ordered the 4 and it is loose although still flattering thanks to the forgiving cut. wish i had gotten a 2 but now they are sold"
3400	"I love everything about this dress! i love the colors - style and fit. it is so comfortable. i had so many people ask where i got it.  i usually wear an xs or s in retailerpolgy dresses and i got this in an xs and it was perfect."
3401	Comfortable and true to size. it fits more fitted on the top and very swingy/flowy on the bottom. i got a petite and the length was perfect. if you like to wear very high heels you may want to go with a regular as its a tad short.
3402	"I ordered the navy/green combo in xl and it's prettier in person. the fit matches the model so it's true to size for me. it is loose through the body. it's not slimming but not widening either. if you like how it looks on the model, that's how it should be when you try it on.  it's soft and flowy and perfect for feeling comfortable. i love how the arms and chest are more fitted. the material has give to it. the stitching everywhere was well-done, no loose strands. it's a great basic. i'm going t"
3403	I loved the colors on this dress, but i don't like the way it fits. it is tight around the shoulders, but the rest of the dress is really big and has no shape
3404	I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!
3405	This jacket is perfect! the crop length is just right! not to short and the way it is cut longer in the back it really paints a beautiful silhouette on my larger frame. i'm a a 12 typically but broad in the shoulders and larger in the bust 36dd. this jacket is loose fitting and roomy. i could probably have gone with a large, but i'm really happy with the xl as i can layer underneath and it's just super roomy and comfy. the quality of this jacket is great. it will be a staple for years to come. i
3406	"I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately, i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise, the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model, it looks like it skims the body, when in reality, it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt, but there was just too much fabric.  though the neck worked for me, i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also, it"
3407	I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8, went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type, but compared to the model, this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.
3408	"I am 5'3"" and the arms of this sweater run at least 2 inches past my finger tips. if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall, it just doesn't work. also, i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online. sigh."
3409	This skirt is so cute. the fix print is really nice. it's a great piece to add to the fall wardrobe.
3410	I wanted to fall in love with this jacket! i'm an xs or s in retailer brands so i ordered this online in both sizes. when i received it i felt the fabric and immediately loved the color and texture. creamy white (not too stark) and so incredibly soft! the length was the same as on the model which is what i wanted because being 5'2 113# many jackets swallow me. i have narrow shoulders and unfortunately this jacket was too broad and puffy for my frame, and i looked like a marshmallow. the xs was the
3411	Love the look. love the fit for both professional and casual looks!!
3412	"This is a great addition! it's comfortable, pretty, and can be dressed up and down. most importantly it's slenderizing and a great length for me! i bought it in my regular size, but bought the petite size, noting the model is 5'10"" and where the dress stopped on her. i'm 5'6"". the dress fits perfectly and is a great length for me! it also comes with a lovely, blue slip! such great quality for the price!"
3413	I really love this pant. ordered online and they fit well. they're cute, edgy with the fray at the bottom. corduroy material. awesome!
3414	"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder, though. the arms themselves are really long, far past my hands, yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference, i am 5'10"", 130 pounds and ordered a small, which is what i usually need."
3415	I love the color and the style, however it doesn't look as well as the model as i don't have a small waist like the model does. still overall, i love this dress and it is well made and comfortable
3416	I wish i could buy this is more colors! so easy to dress up or dress down
3417	Usually i'd wait for a sale on rayon loungewear but i would have gladly paid more if this was cotton or silk! despite the poor fabric, the design is light and beautiful with a high quality floral print that's distinctive and elegant. i can wear this with a thin strappy slip or a lacy cami bra or with a cardigan, jacket and lacy boy shorts. an retailer employee wore this chemise under a denim shirtdress and belted the whole outfit together--it was perfection. i purchased size m and my figure is 39-
3418	I love the off the shoulder tee so much that i ordered two of them in different colors. i can wear them with jeans or i can wear them with gym attire while out running errands and still feel like i look nice!
3419	Love this top! i just purchased this shirt from my local retailer store. i noticed it when i walked in and saw it on display. it's stylish, comfortable, and subtle. it runs large so size down. normally, i wear a medium in retailer tops but needed a small. the flower print is small and the colors are muted against the black. pairs well with several colors: black (like model), dark denim, olive green, and mauve. the display had it tucked into a soft khaki colored pair of pants that worked as well.
3420	I love these pants, i actually bought them twice! the special dye in them did not agree with my detergent so i bought another pair on sale.....some woolite and will wash them inside out/hang to dry. will take better care of my second pair.
3421	Very cozy lounge tee, but runs large. i ordered a small rather than my usual medium and could of probably went down two sizes.
3422	Super flattering! stretch a little with repeated wear but not as much as other pairs. i love these!!!
3423	"The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise, the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area. the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials."
3424	Hi , i bought these in moss for both of my daughters. they love them. the material is substantial and washes beautifully. the fit is straight up and down and is not forgiving on figure flaws. i would recommend this to a thin figured girl.
3425	This is beautiful on. it flatters the figure nicely. the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin. it is very low cut but it looks wonderful.
3426	Such a beautiful pattern on a lovely fabric. soft to the touch and flows beautifully. i love the lacing and even the butterfly sleeves - which i'm usually not a fan or. i have a feeling i'm going to wear this to death once the weather warms up! my only complaint is the slip, which is a scratchy material that is also completely see through. it's also very short, at least for my comfort. i have a plain black slip i'll be using instead, which is fine with me as i bought the dress for the outer shel
3427	This dress just feels and looks amazing. i love how it isn't too short like a lot of new styles. i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter. i also love the plaid cuff detail. the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced. i got home and realized one button was missing. i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms, 2 buttons popped off!
3428	"These are my favorite tights. i love how they are opaque. i love that they are thick but not so thick as to be only appropriate for winter. they are slimming without feeling too tight.  why don""t you sell these any more??? please bring them back!"
3429	I love purchasing these tunic/ruffle dresses because they can be worn anywhere.....this dress is definitely a little on the heavy side for winter wear...the color is beautiful...i am 5'4''. 138 pounds and always purchase a large for a relaxed fit....i plan to wear it out to dinner for my birthday and to a house party on new years day....
3430	I am 5'3' and 120 lbs for reference, and pear shaped and this dress in a 4 petite fit like a glove. granted, not a dress i would want to gain weight in, but fit perfectly. usually i am a 2 in retailer dresses but read other reviews and definitely made the right choice. it hits at a very flattering length even for someone as short as i am.
3431	"Got this in the white and it fits perfectly. just the right length and enough detail on the shoulders. i'm 5'6"" and 120 (usually an xxs or xs for tops) and the xs fits just right, not too loose not too tight. i like the style since it emphasizes my shoulders and balances nicely with cropped jeans (i'm pear shaped). material is slightly clingy but it adds to the drape nicely (wouldn't work well if it was fitted, but it's not)."
3432	I ordered this in size xl and ended up returning it as soon as i received it. the color was just as pretty in person. the thick eyelet panel was well done. the problem is the whole tank was much smaller/tighter than pictured. i have several tops from this maker and was surprised how this was cut too small compared to their normal fit. i'm pear-shaped, so the hip area looked terrible. but, the whole top just wasn't up to the typical fitting standards for xl. retailer has done much better in the pas
3433	These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy, sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great.
3434	"This dress did not disappoint. it fits great. i'm 5'3"" and weigh 114 and i got a petite xs. length was perfect, i have a longer torso, so the waist was a bit higher than mine, but it didn't sit strangely and hung well. i am small chested, and the top fit me very well, i think if you have been blessed in that area, you may want to size up.  overall, it really is beautiful, the pattern and the unexpected transition from one pattern to the next is just what i hoped for and why i buy from retailer. i"
3435	Wore it to an interview. the color is fantastic. it's beautiful and artsy. highly recommend!
3436	"I was a little hesitant to buy these given that i am just 5'1"" - i didn't want to look like an extra from the set of ""newsies."" but these are very well made and tailored for a woman's body...the trousers actually accentuate the waist and the cropped leg works well for a petite frame. they are nicely lined and the wool blend is soft and not scratchy. i love them!"
3437	"This 1960s aprã¨s-ski style sweater is made of an amazingly soft pure wool in a color that is a touch brighter and maybe even a bit more coral pink than the online photo looks to me. there is a large button under the collar that shows if you stand it up. seems to be of a very high quality, comparable to vintage hand-knit sweaters. . it is very chunky and warm, and i would recommend taking a size up for a looser fit. i'm 5'2"", 33-25-37, narrow shoulders, and otth the xs and s fit me well, running"
3438	This is a beautiful skirt. great, soft, draping fabric. fringed along the edges. i ordered size large, which was an okay fit, perhaps a bit wide but the drawstring helps at the waist. because i carry my weight in the tummy, this made me look wider than i am. as an elder, i just couldn't handle the length which hit me right at the top of the widest part of knee. i have great legs but my knees aren't their best feature. so sadly, returned but i do recommend.
3439	"This top takes every other tee and blows it out of the water! it appears subtle on the hanger, but it looks so lady like on! the flutter sleeve are darling. the top does have a lot of volume, but the drape is so lovely, it adds some shape. it is perfect to wear everyday and dress up! i bought to wear with the bryden skirt. for reference, i purchased ordered the xs (though i am wearing a s in the photo) and i am 34c, 26"" waist. the shoulder fit okay with easter size, but there was a little less v"
3440	"I initially bought the red and blue sweater in a medium. i usually wear a large and the medium fits perfectly and is still a bit baggy. i'm tall (5'9"") and so i love the length of the sleeves when they are unrolled. it's a very versatile piece. with sleeves rolled down you can fold the collar so the red is out of sight and just have a navy blue sweater. either look is nice. i loved it so much i bought the black and brown version. also, the fabric doesn't feel thick but it is very insulating and"
3441	"I love the model's pairing of this sweatshirt and was struck by it when i walked in the store! like the other reviewer said, you could dress up or down (despite the ""sweatshirt"" name) and i'm planning to wear it with the galleria corduroy skirt and gray booties. love the stitched pockets on the side! (but i'm unlikely to put anything there since it would probably fall out!)  sizing: definitely boxy as the first reviewer said. i'm solidly a small in most tops, and this one i have a bit of spare"
3442	"This dress is even more gorgeous in person! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store. i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years. i think i have finally found ""the one'! i should note i am 5'9"" and this dress goes all the way to my knees. it may swallow someone on the shorter side."
3443	I purchased this shirt in grey. i loved the color and the details, especially the lace on the shoulders. i just found the fit to be off for me. the style certainly calls for a relaxed fit but the small was loose in an unflattering way. had the xs been available i might have considered exchanging for an xs but the s was already a bit short on me. (strange because although i am not petite, i am fairly short wasted.) i also wasn't in love with the neckline. i will continue my search for a weekend-w
3444	I agree with previous review...looks so much better in person than online! i really do not need another poncho style sweater, but i could not resist. they colors and style are great!
3445	"I'm 5'3"" and 160 pounds with short legs and got a large petite. it fits really well (a tiny bit too short but could just be my proportions) and the quality seems very high. definitely can be dressed up or down (good for a business casual work environment)."
3446	"Unlike the other reviewers, i did not have any problem with the sizing, fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think it's suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 5'8"", 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good."
3447	Fits perfect.
3448	Very comfortable shirt.  washes up nicely with just a little ironing on the pleats.  cute detail of colored thread on buttons.  just a tad tight in the shoulders but not distracting.  no button placket chest gapping.
3449	It is very comfortable and the fabric is amazing. it runs a little short on me because i have a long torso, but it works great with a tank underneath. love it!
3450	I am so glad i had read the other reviews of this jacket which prompted me to order. great fit and cut with a hint of stretch, nice styling details, great vintage color. i wasn't in love with the price but after receiving the jacket i would gladly pay the price again. will definitely be in my wardrobe rotation for years to come!
3451	The print is unique and fun. however, the longer length and heavier weight of the fabric was not the piece i needed in my closet.
3452	Color, style, adjustability, easy fit, flattering!  yes on so many levels!  oh wait it's on sale!  fantastic, magnificent and pretty!  i bought medium and in 39-28-35
3453	Not just another striped tee. perfect drape & lightly fitted at the bottom sides so it skims the body & is super flattering. the subtle shimmer is just right. love the gray! very versatile & irresistible. i'm a size 4/small & this is tts.
3454	"I purchased these bottoms with the matching peplum top in romantic floral. i also purchased the higher waisted bottoms just in case.  i returned the higher bottoms and that's saying a lot.  i have two sons and now struggle with fit in regard to two piece bathing suits.  the higher bottoms just didn't fit right and i didn't need the extra coverage because these fit so well and the peplum gives extra coverage, though not really necessary.  the others cut in a bit in the seat and hips and these"
3455	I ordered these without reading the previous reviews and i would have to agree with everything everyone has already said. these are the cutest cords i've seen in a long time! they're definitely skinny, bridging on way too skinny through the calves but i'm willing to stick it out. the thing that bugs me about them is how stinking short they are?? the description doesn't really mention that they're crops but at this length any ankle bootie is going to be too short. also, they aren't navy. they're
3456	The material and color of the dress were great, but the fit was rather blah. i don't think it was right for my shape. i am disappointed though, i liked design of it.
3457	I absolutely love this blouse...i ordered it in peach..then waited for the raspberry to come back in my size...now i have 2 colors...it runs really large....but putting a tank or cami underneath is fun :-)
3458	I can understand the concerns of another reviewer about shrinkage. i have a few retailer tops made of similar fabric and they have shrunk a bit. this too fits very well, but once i wash it, it will likely get a bit smaller. i ordered a small, but plan to size up to a medium. for ref. 32ddd bust, and the small fit perfectly with a camo underneath...the shoulders seem to be cut small. so if you are busty like me, size up.
3459	I initially bought this dress to wear to an interview that required something casual, yet could be dressed up with interesting jewelry. although i ended up wearing another black dress, i kept this.  paired with interesting black booties and a great necklace, this dress is easy to wear  - and stylish. most importantly, comfortable. i could see myself wearing this on days that i feel inspired to dress up, but want to wear something that is not fussy. and, the pockets!
3460	I am 5'3, curvy and wear a size 12 and these pants look amazing! often i struggle with wide keg pants bc they make me look short and plump, however, the material is buttery soft and hang in an elegant way and most important they are quite flattering. even if you don't think culottes will work for your body type- i suggest you give these a try.
3461	"I love hess overalls. they are true to size and have a great vintage look to them but done in a classic way. i am 5'6"" 125lbs and a 34b. i bought the xs and it fit great! they are fitted and not sloppy like a lot of overalls. you can easily dress them up or down. soft and stretchy material is a plus"
3462	This sweater is wonderful for late summer/early fall or cooler weather over long sleeves. the sleeves taper just below the elbow, which seems slightly odd when first putting it on - as though they should be a tad longer (hence the 4 stars), but i quickly forget about this while wearing the sweater and it does look great!
3463	Noticed all the 5 star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets- so due to the past 2 years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans....i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula- thick denim, just the right amount of give and a flattering 10 inch rise. walked right in and found them- and i knew right when i touched them- they were still the thin denim that's nowhere near the quality they once were. consumers pay attention and t
3464	"So i recommend wearing with something more fitted, or with a flare (jeans), or tucked in like the picture. i love the detail of hte polka dot on the sleeves and collar (inside), so if you leave the collar open or roll the sleeves up a bit, you see hte contrast. it is a bit short, and i am petite, i ended up with regular size anyway otherwise, it may have been too short.  colors are nice, and i love the material, it is very soft and hoepfulyl warm (my orffice is freezing). should ahve grabbed it"
3465	"I have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans, and have loved them all!!! these, unfortunately i do not like. i think they run large and the fit, just blah. the waist gapped and kinda had a ""mom jean"" look. i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand."
3466	This is a great quality top. it did not look great on me, since i am quite top heavy. but is lovely.
3467	Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather.
3468	I love this skirt! i know others have thought it frumpy, maybe it's because i'm so long waisted but this skirt is perfect for me! not too long not too short but just right! the fabric print is beautiful a mix of muted and bright colors. the fabric quality is nice but nothing overly outstanding. still i'm glad i ordered it before it was gone!
3469	What a wonderful find! yes, it runs big. .. and beautiful! love the quality, and design. very light and airy. this is great for me because i'm not short & i am busty & i love tunics. this item can be dressed up or played down with class. the lining is a perfect complement to the tunic as well and fits nice with the garment. i am usually to busy to write a review, but i felt obligated on this item. five stars!
3470	"The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction."
3471	This is a wonderful dress. i love the fit and feel of the fabric. i have been looking for a while for a 'fall' maxi to wear with a pair of free people boots i purchased. this dress is perfect with them. the colors are fall and fresh, can i say that about fall?
3472	Love this sweater! it can be used for both work and casual wear with ease. very soft and seems durable. i highly recommend it!
3473	This is now one of my favorite retailer button downs. it's super soft and super flattering. it's everything you'd want this cute shirt to be!
3474	These chinos fit great! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear. i bought all 3 colors!
3475	I was so excited for this dress to come. i am 5&#39;1&quot; and 100lbs so i ordered and xs petite. it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around. maybe on someone taller this would have looked great. i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate. my dress was a much lighter blue. back to the store it goes.
3476	"Love this jumpsuit, i was rather apprehensive as i didn't think it would look as good on me as on the model but i am totally smitten with it. very flattering, especially if you have some bumps and rolls. i ordered in a medium (5.7 and 145 lbs and it fits perfectly. definitely recommend to order down.  as i'm wearing it to yoga i wear a sports bra underneath, that also helps with the very deep and open back to cover up a bit more. highly recommend, the top hits in all the right spots to make one"
3477	I love this top so much i bought it in 3 colors. the material is so soft and comfortable. has a slight fitting in the waist to make it very flattering. you can wear the next as pictured or button it up and slouch it and it looks great both ways. perfect with jeans or dress it up with slacks. just wish it wasn't dry clean only.
3478	This dress is gorgeous. i took the advice of a previous reviewer and tried one size down, it fit perfectly. i am usually between a 10 or 8 in retailer dresses depending on the cut, the size 8 in this was great. i am near the small chested side a 36b and there was still plenty of room in the top. the swimmers on the dress are embroidered and i didn't really notice until i saw the inside. beautiful detail. the dress is a lightweight cotton and great for warm weather. its even more flattering to be a
3479	"This is a beautiful and versatile skirt. i love the layered detail, length, and flattering cut.   the fabric is a 80% cotton/20% linen blend. it's a thick weave with tiny nubs here and there. the skirt was made in turkey.  i usually wear a size 4 in retailer skirts, but i sized down to a 2 in this skirt. the size 2 fit at my natural waist and looked as pictured on the model, whereas the 4 looked bulkier on me,"
3480	"First, i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics.    what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that, although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin"
3481	I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did. mine does not have any weird smell at all. i ordered a medium and i wear a size 8. it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings ...with coverage. the detailing on the yoke is so pretty. i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better. i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe!!
3482	"This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on. great quality, fabric was lovely, just a little sparkle at the hemline, scallops were great but i put it on, i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return. love the look, it just was terrible on me. i'm petite, 5'0"" and weigh 110# so i'm not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa."
3483	"This t-shirt is very casual, so it is perfect for everyday use.  touch of textile is comfortable, so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this t-shirt.  although stripe is a simple design, it does not limit your choise of fashion, so it can go with almost anything.  just be aware that this t-shirt runs a little larger than the true size."
3484	I ordered these in both the grey and moss, and i love both. they are very soft, very easy, loose fitting casual shorts. i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured, so they hit lower on my leg than on the model, which i prefer in these. i am 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered xs. the dark grey ones feel more versatile, like you could throw on anything with them and go. the moss look cute with white/cream summery tops. they washed well (machine, cold, laid flat to dry), touched up with light steam from
