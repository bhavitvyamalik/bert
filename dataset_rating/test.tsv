3000	This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large, arm holes are very low.  not flattering.
3001	I like the casual, yet detailed look of this piece. it looks great with crops. the casual tie string makes the piece feel very laid back, but the details are so pretty. i have it in lavender. it looks way better in person. saw it at the store and grabbed it immediately.
3002	These pants are so great, light, comfortable and reasonably priced. they are very well made, and the soft fabric is perfect for summer traveling and hiking. there's a bit of elastic in the waist which i like since pants usually gap at the waist on me. they're like classier lounge pants.
3003	I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5'6 120 and usually a s fits. however, this was really tight. also, the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one.
3004	"I'm a 5'7""and curvy, these pants fit well and are so comfortable. i think everyone should own at least one pair!"
3005	"I see me wearing this dress with more of an edgey look - not going for romantic. smoky eye, skinny dark jeans under it and pumps. swings further from body than i thought.  i'm 5'7"", wear a 34b and am typically a size 2. that's the size i bought. fits well and while pretty, it's made with heft ... not overly delicate - can't see this snagging. it's more of a cotton lace which is why it looks cool with skinny jeans. detail at the neck gives it more interest."
3006	"The quality of this sweater is excellent. it is well work the money. i am 34d 5'4"" and purchased a medium. fits perfectly for a fitted look and hits right at my natural waistline."
3007	I would have liked it but it was too small for me.
3008	I ordered ths thinking it was likea blazer, but it is soft and not structured, like a t-shirt. however, it is rather flattering on. i had a har dtime deciding whether to keep it. the regular size was fine on me, i usually require peites, but this doesn't come in petites, and it was really nice with the fitted cowl shirt i was wearing. i am definitely putting it back in my wish list (as i did end up returning).
3009	Green- feminine and flattering, love this dress!!
3010	This dress is perfection! great, quality fabric. bright vibrant color. the design and texture allow it to be dressed up or dressed down. i sized up a size because my normal wasn't available and it fits perfectly!
3011	I really wanted to love this dress. the cut out design is beautiful and it is very feminine. however, it does not really cut in at the waist and it left me feeling a bit boxy. i think if it cinched at the waist, it would be perfect. it didn't work out for me, but i think on the right girl, it would be very cute.
3012	This jacket is very cozy but i had to send it back. i think it will be great on a taller person.
3013	"I ordered this in my usual retailer size, xspetite and it was too baggy in the bust. granted, i'm only a 34aa, but i would still expect it to be a little smaller in the bust at that size. the elastic waist was a little loose too (i have a 26"" waist, 34"" hips) and the inner slip showed a tiny bit like another reviewer said but it's the same fabric as the dress. the slip is adjustable but it's attached to the dress at the waist. it wasn't flattering on me in the hips either. this was a miss for me b"
3014	Received this product with a gaping hole in it. very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse
3015	I saw this in store, but they didn't have my size and i balked at the price. however, i kept thinking about it and once i received it from online i now think it's well worth it. the quality is very nice and it fits tts. i like that the arm materials is stretchy. i've worn this with jeans, but will also wear it with a skirt to the office. it's got enough weight to function as a light spring jacket. the color matches the photo and is a nice neutral to go with many things.
3016	I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item.
3017	I was surprised at how much i liked this sweater. i was watching it for awhile and when it went on sale i decided to give it a try. i couldn't decided on the rose or black so i ordered both since they were such a good price, figuring i would return the color i didn't want. boy was i happy i ordered both. the rose is very flattering and the fit is so much better than i expected. i am 5'9' and usually take a large in size. i could have gone down one size, but the front drapes against your body it
3018	I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment, it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.
3019	I happened upon this in my local store despite the fact that it is an online exclusive. i love finding returns so i can see them in person. i loved the soft colors right away. my hesitation was the standup collar but it actually folds down just fine and gives the vest lapels too. it also looks nice belted, left slightly open. i usually wear small or xs in tops and the small fits nicely. it doesn't need to close since there are no built-in fasteners. i will wear it with a long button down shirt o
3020	Great fit and style. the color is perfect for spring, they have a nautical feel to them.
3021	So comfortable-so versatile-so perfect
3022	I bought this dress for my wedding rehearsal dinner. it's beautiful. the material is thicker than i imagined, not a bad thing at all. i ironed it with lots of steam and it came out great. the tie in back is nice because it can be cinched tight or worn more loosely
3023	"This is a very stylish and unique trench. it does run a bit large as i am usually a medium in jackets, but needed a small for this one. i am 5'2"" , 120 lbs., but with a large chest. i think it's very flattering. i have small hips, but the large pockets do not make me look bigger. it arrived very wrinkled, but i just touched it up with an iron. i think the color is more of a taupe-gray and will go with everything. love it!"
3024	This top is super versatile--i wear it with jeans on the weekend but it's also work appropriate. it's light and perfect for warm weather!
3025	This top is pretty and i did not find it sheer at all but i am returning it due to the lace sleeves are tight. but, i do have large arms! other than the sleeves i would keep it!
3026	If i could wear this top every single day, i would. this is the white flowy top i've been dreaming of; but better! the fabric is so lightweight and breathable. i can wear this on a cool spring night with a scarf, skinny jeans & ankle boots, or on a hot summer day with shorts/skinnies and sandals. you can dress it up or down. be aware that the chest hem is at a non-traditional height; not quite above or below the breasts. however, i think it looks flattering on both small-chested and busty women.
3027	"This is a beautiful top, but it runs large. i am exchanging for one size smaller. it is worth the effort of exchanging! well made, beautiful lace."
3028	These cords are soft, comfy and my normal size 32 for tts. the length was fine for my 5'9 height. i really like the bronze color, it is almost a yellow.
3029	This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color, it looked as if i'd washed it in filthy water. it's a very dingy white, needless to say it went back.
3030	"Not what i was expecting, but pleasantly surprised.  was envisioning a more structured/tailored trouser, but these are closer to leggings, albeit very substantial ones with ""real pant"" touches like a zip/button front and (faux) pockets.  they're form fitting, soft yet supportive, stretchy, incredibly comfortable, and tts.  i'm a pretty legit 10 in pants (30/31), and the 10's near perfect, with the rise coming right to my belly button.  think i'll grab another pair now while they're available."
3031	I recently purchased this vest and unlike other reviews, i found it to be tts. with that being said, i am typically a medium in retailer tops or 8/10. i have broad shoulders (5'9, 145lbs). i purchased the medium and it fit perfect through the shoulders. it is meant to be flowy and gives some volume in a good way. if that's the look you are going for this is the top for you. had i gone down a size, i would not have been able to hook the top. i am going to be wearing this with blue jeans and white s
3032	I absolutely love this dress! i got it right after my first baby was born to wear to an outdoor, early october wedding. it was perfect! the fit is flattering and the dress is well made. it's a classy, elegant dress and i have worn it many times since.
3033	As far as t-shirts go, this one is fun, i love the lace up detail in the back. the xs regular fit nicely (115 lbs, 30dd), the shirt flares out (swing), so it can be a little much on the smaller gals, but it was ok enough on me that the stylist decided to try it on too. the orange color was pretty, but i decided to pass as i have a lot of orange tops... and that is the color that was most flattering on my skin. amterial is on the thinner side and a little tiny sheer, must be the trend...
3034	Just received this in the mail, and i love it! the fit is wide and flowy, but i wouldn't say it runs large... i don't think i could have sized down in the shoulders. perfect easy, breezy fall top. cannot wait to wear it!
3035	"So i love pilcro, i wear them all the time and usually size down because they ""grow"" after wearing them. i tried on my usual size in these and felt like they are too tight, not sure if they will get any looser. the material feels really good, lightweight and the stripes are subtle but cute. not sure if i'll keep them or maybe size up,"
3036	I bought one of these as a gift for a friend and i loved it so much i had to get one for myself! it's beautiful material and has lovely detail, a little sheer so best worn with a cami underneath. probably better for those with not too ample busts as it doesn't have a lot of stretch.
3037	Kicky little pleat in the back is interesting and comfortable. great fit, good colors and doesn't wrinkle easily.
3038	I was really excited for this sweater, its not terrible but its not great. the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it. it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it. i would try a different sweater.
3039	I bought these in 'vintage sage' and i grab for them as often as my favorite skinny jeans. if you are just dipping your toe in colored pants i would reccomend the same color, it is undertsated and easily paired with so many other colors. the legs run a little big but the waist is tru to size, so for comfort i went with my usual size.
3040	This top fits loosely through the body and a little snigger in the bust. fabric is nice but does require some ironing/steaming at times. it is a little pricey but you won't find anything similar so being unique makes it worth the cost. i ordered online but it was available at my local retailer store; unfortunately the online order didn't show availability & i would have liked to see it first since i was unsure of size ( usually wear medium if top has a relaxed fit, large if not). very cute too!
3041	"Cute shirt. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. size s fits perfectly. a little shorter in the back than i'd like but great for layering."
3042	"The fox print is super cute and the reason i ordered the skirt.  sizing was true to me, i'm usually an 8 and the 8 fit fine.  the waist is high and if you try to wear it low the side zipper puckers  out in a weird way.  skirt length is above knee (i'm 5' 6"").  skirt is lined but the lining is dark brown/black same as the waist band in the photo of the model wearing it.  the lining does not show at the hem, it's concealed.  overall a fun a-line swingy skirt for late summer that will go into fall"
3043	I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down, but i bought it online, so i just decided to live with it. pretty top, though i do think it runs large.
3044	Got a ton of compliments.  great tee with beautiful print.
3045	"After reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman. my regular size (small) was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well. the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me. this top definitely has no problem staying ""off the shoulder"" since i have broad shoulders it doesn't completely come off me. loving the boho-chic vibe of this!"
3046	This dress is extremely body conscious. so if you want to make an impression, wear this dress. the fabric is thick and best worn on a cooler night. the pattern is gorgeously done, pieced together like a garment three times the cost. the cut of the armholes might not be flattering on those with broad shoulders or chubby upper arms (like myself). for me this dress is tts but way too long, so i will have to hem.
3047	As a teacher, it's so great to be able to find dresses that are modest and beautiful, that i can wear to work, as well as on the weekends.
3048	This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on, it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side, gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also, it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.
3049	Light and distinctive design. the fabric seems somehow synthetic and in very warm weather might become not so fresh
3050	"Loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape.  looks great on. the tie in front adds to the dress.   i love to wear with tan knee-high boots."
3051	I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different, but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top, the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.
3052	"I love his cardigan! i knew the small would be a little big since i am normally an xs or xxs. i decided to give it a try anyway. it's definitely a little big - i would have liked an xs to be an option (5'3"" and 110lbs, for reference). i'm keeping it because it still looks cute, just a little loose through the body."
3053	"You do not want to know how many cropped, wide-leg jeans i've tried on. all the rest make me look ridiculous for various reasons....it's not easy to get this style right, apparently. these are great: comfy, make my legs look cute, not chopped off, they are not mysteriously tight in the upper thigh (why do some do that?) they act like trousers with a jean's casual edge. the ""let out"" hem is super cute and they are soft and comfortable. perfect with tucked in or shorter blouse styles.  i bought"
3054	Would buy this again in a heartbeat. so comfortable and fit is great. color will look good with jeans or a dress. bought it for a cruise in the spring and it is perfect!
3055	You can't go wrong with these pants. as other reviews point out when they say skinny they do mean that this is a skinny fit so order accordingly. i ordered a 4 when i have been wearing 2s in many other styles and was glad for the 4. i thought the fabric was all season so don't agree with some other reviewers regarding the stiffness of the fabric. i think it's perfect. everyone is different. these are pretty close to year-round wearable.
3056	This coat is truly gorgeous in person. it's an investment coat, one that i will probably wear for years to come because the style is timeless and the color is lovely. i found it to be very high quality. in fact, i would love to see more coats of this caliber from retailer. the other reviews had me hesitant to splurge on it, but i don't plan on wearing it buttoned very often so that will be a non-issue for me. the lining is one of the best parts of the coat! show it off! i think the problem
3057	The fit on this dress is super flattering! i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one. i am definitely a pear shape, bigger on the bottom than the top. one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top. this is not often the case. i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it. i also love the colors. i bought the green and blue. i have worn it once
3058	I ordered this on a whim during retailer days sale and i'm glad i did. it's now one of those shirts that calls my name every morning. i've worn it with denim skinnies and a knee length black knit pencil skirt. so soft and flattering. i got it in the red, but am tempted by the blue!
3059	"I automatically knocked off one star because every brand that offers size xs (and many also offer xxs), should also care about us size 14/16/xls as well. i ordered a size large, and of course it shows every bump and love handle in back, but i recreated a look from my local retailer's window. they showed a long unbuttoned cotton weave dress over this crochet dress. (the closest dress pictured online to what i saw is the ""mabli maxi dress"", but imagine it opened if it had buttons, and in blue.) with"
3060	In retailer dresses the petites usually fit me better, i'm short, but this regular fit well. looks super cute, i've gotten so many compliments on it. comfortable, and the pockets are always nice.
3061	Beautiful,delicate and unique cotton blouse that accentuates the waist and falls nicely down the belly. i love the floral print, very appropriate for spring/summer. i agree with the other reviewers who've mentioned that it runs small. i have a bust size of 34 dd and waist size 25 and i had to size up to 12. nevertheless, i am really looking forward to wearing this with a pair of skinny jeans and some nude pumps for a girls night out.
3062	I am in love with theses! they are incredibly comfortable and flattering. i have an hourglass figure, and they hug my hips perfectly. they perfect for the gym, but also look great with a tunic and booties for fun weekend wear. good + pure are my new go to legging brand. i'm going to order the solid black and other patterns retailer has.
3063	I agree a few others, it may be a little bit boxy but i don't even care because it's so beautiful! definitely a top i'm going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade.
3064	Love the color, weight and styling on this sweater. it is soft and comfortable and i will wear it a lot. the only downfall is that it sheds, so it can not be worn with leggings or you will end up with fuzz everywhere.
3065	Great job from the fabricators in creating such a gorgeous print on light-as-air silk! i'm so happy with the dress and can stare at it for hours, that's how pretty it is. the fit is perfect on me and disguised my figure flaws since it's an a-line skirt that doesn't cling. yes, the skirt is sheer and unlined and for the price a slip should have been included. fortunately i own a silky half slip that complements nicely. i'm a top heavy 36dd, large rib cage, 140# with a square waist and no hips and
3066	Hi, this top is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. very feminine. it has a small amount of swing without a large amount of fabric. love it.
3067	Ordered this dress in an xs, that is the size i usually wear. this runs small, but not only that it is the way it is cut, very small through the hips, thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model, but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!
3068	I love this dress! tried it on at the store. they only had medium. while i'm usually always a medium, it fit perfectly but pulled at the bust (i'm a 38). i ordered a large online the next day. i have it now and i am extremely pleased. the pattern is unique, the length falls just above the knee and has s sexy flirtiness to it. the back button is key as it gives some contour to the dress. the side pockets are an awesome touch. you can wear this dress any season. i'm wearing it with ankle boots and
3069	I love that this tee is so soft and is not boring! when i originally took it out of the bag, my teenage daughter did not like it. then i tried it on and she was wowed! the longer length in the back makes it very interesting. i am looking forward to wearing this with jeans.
3070	I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers, but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws, the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck, not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining, this is a spring and early fall dress
3071	I saw this dress in the store window and gave it a try. i found it to be super flattering and feminine. the bodice is form fitting and the skirt flares out to a full skirt. the colors are fun and vibrant. the neckline is a bit low for work but perfect for evening. it is true to size.
3072	Looks and fits just like the picture. fabric is nice and soft. looking forward to wearing this tunic as soon as the weather cools just a little
3073	I bought this tee for a light summer top as i love linen. this top does not disappoint. i bought my usual size xs and the length is good-slightly longer in back. i purchased the black and the grey. the grey will be great with jeans in any color and the black i can wear either dressed up or down. the quality seems good. great purchase!
3074	Just purchased this on sale. will be perfect for summer on those days you wear dresses and don't want your skin to touch the subway bench! love it!
3075	I really love this dress and want to buy it, but i won't buy it in white. it is just too easy to get dirty. i would love a pretty blue or even a darker yellow.
3076	More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid
3077	A great basic t, so very much cuter than most. i have black and white both and wish it came in more colors.
3078	I purchased this with some hesitation, having read that some people thought it was unflattering. but i couldn't resist the sale price, and i love a low-maintenance work top and doesn't require ironing. this fits the bill perfectly. it's made of high quality fabric, there's a soft inner lining with a side zip closure, and it has a pretty narrow profile so initially i found it a little snug to wiggle into (i got a small), but once on it fit perfectly, and is so flattering i can't imagine why other
3079	I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.
3080	Based on other reviews, i ordered these trousers in my regular size 8 (dark grey) and up one size10 (black motif). the size 8 fit perfectly; and the size 10 are too big (returning). i am not sure what the other reviewers experienced, but size 8 in this brand fits, regardless of style. i also prefer the solid grey, but that is just a personal choice. i felt the black motif trousers looked like pajama bottoms.
3081	This is the softest shirt, super comfy, very baggy but i'd say true to size for the style. it is a bit thin and i'm worried how it will hold up, or would have given the full 5 stars. i'm not a usual fan of the turtle neck but this is so soft, i love it!
3082	These are awesome! i have the pink which is a very light faded sort of color. they are beautiful and very nice quality. they are slimmer and stretchier then i imagined but very flattering.
3083	I just love the print on this shirt!  it is so feminine and pretty!  the material is very soft!  i took my usual medium.  a great addition to my spring wardrobe!
3084	This is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit. material is very thin. i ordered white, which was completely see-through. not at all what i was expecting. might work better in a darker color, but i returned it since it was nothing special.
3085	Soft pretty socks. a little big if you have smaller feet. i'm a size 7.5, and they are a tad too big but still comfortable.
3086	"I purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it on-line and ordered it in my usual size petite 6 (i'm 5'4"" 34d-27-35) and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on. i immediately adored all the different prints on this one, the length, the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter. it's a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well. also,"
3087	They were too small for me. i loved them other than that.
3088	This top is really cute. the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it. the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top. i was afraid it might make it too stiff & bulky around the shoulders, but it doesn't. very cute. the armholes are cut on the bigger side, but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anything.(just comfortable) the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming. runs pretty tts. i ordered my usual medium and it's not quite as form fitting
3089	This dress is very versatile and flattering on-- i've already worn it out to casual cocktails with friends twice since i've gotten it. i'm 5'3 and 125 lbs and the 4 petite worked perfectly on me.
3090	I was pleasantly surprised with this cardigan! i get so many compliments- i can easily see me carrying this into my fall wardrobe!
3091	So glad i was able to snag these killer 70's-ish flares. they are super cool at a nice length. love the button detail. i ordered these in my current size and they fit right out of the box. love them so much.
3092	I love the desi blouse! i got it in white and it's a little more off white than pure white, but it is a great flowy top. the touch of lace across the bust is a nice accent. the only down fall is that the sleeves are a bit puffy, but the rest of the top makes up for that.
3093	I bought this in navy and love the multi textures and look. i'm happy it was on sale because it is so cute but i would not have paid full price on it. it runs small. i plan on wearing it for casual errand days.
3094	Oh my goodness, i paid full price for this dress because i loved it so much. i styled it with a cream lace poncho , also from retailer, and it is gorgeous. at the sale price, you can't lose.
3095	Just as the others have reviewed, i agree! this dress is flowy and so feminine. i got it today and i am wearing it now! so light! i usually wear a large or a 12 in dresses. i am pear shaped. 36b bust and large hips. it is flattering and feels great on. the slip underneath fits perfect on me. grab this before it becomes iso!
3096	This is one of my favorite.it is timeless for sure.
3097	These pants are amazing. they are so comfortable and fit true to size. i typically wear a 28 or 29 depending on the pants and the 28s fit me perfectly. i bought the olive green pair and they are everything i have ever wanted in a pair of olive pants. i love that they are tighter in the butt area and loose in the knees and calves so they are not restrictive. i want every color!
3098	I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.
3099	Easy to wear, but still has a lot of style. i see this becoming a new basic.
3100	I ordered the xx petite on this one, and unlike last year's version of a similar sweater, this one is a bit longer and looser. last year, i kept the xs p, but it was shorter too. the fit is loose, not snug or form-fitting, even as the smallest size available, it was loose but not large or unflattering. the length was also appropriate. love the colors, and pattern too. the material is soft, and the button detail in the back is fun. i am 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs, for reference.
3101	The dress i received has a blue lining under the patterned chiffon, unlike the white lining that is pictured. the back of the dress is more open than it appears in the pictures so the blue lining and the large exposed zipper is a significant portion of the dress design. also, the arm holes are cut short which makes the dress feel awkward on. the quality of the dress is very high.
3102	"I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5'5"", 120 lbs, straight figure, very tiny ""girls"") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the ""swin"
3103	Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.
3104	Bought this tank on a whim, but i'm so happy i did! so flattering, comfy and well made.
3105	I am waist-challenged. i like a narrowly cut structured sheath dress, sort of like the 60s styles. this is a great dress either belted or loose with great accessories and lovely shoes. it has so many colors in the pattern, you can wear this with anything, and the fabric is so high-end and quality that you can definitely wear this to work with a jacket and then change into a denim or leather jacket and tough high boots and go out for the evening in the fall-winter. it arrived in the mail and righ
3106	Perfect substitute for leggings to wear with a long shirt skirts or shorts. and are thick enough to keep you warm and aren't as thin as some tights normally are.
3107	Nice basic top...i will get plenty of use out of this! love the neckline.
3108	I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it's a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass.  had to send it back.
3109	Classic and stylish. trendy with the blocking...rich colors, soft and comfy. i typically wear s and s was perfect. i love this sweater.
3110	Love this white shirt! it fits great and gives you a little breathing room around the waist. this goes with shorts, skirts, and jeans. i will be wearing it all summer
3111	"It is a pretty dress but not what i had hoped for (i ordered it online.) i like slits on sleeves but the dress doesn't fit me well, so i plan to return it. p.s. it has pockets! :-)"
3112	This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.
3113	This dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me, not so much. i am normally a size 0/00 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker, but it was very thin and didn't seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design, just not the right material or fit.
3114	This is one of the most flattering tops i've ever owned. i'm a little confused by the other reviews, because the model in the photo doesn't have it tacked in the back. you can see on the photo of the back, there's a button to pull it in which makes it so incredibly flattering. it's soft and beautiful, but very delicate. i'd wash it separately and carefully, and rarely :) i actually had to return my first one because of a hole in the material. overall, one of my new favorite tops.
3115	"I actually like this top, but i am wearing it as a cowl neck rather than off-the-shoulder. i found it at the store, so i didn't even know it was supposed to be that way. i have the ivory color, and it it does have some tan/beige specks in it, but i don't mind this at all, it adds some texture and warmth. i think it is a great neutral top for work. it has a double layer of fabric, so not sheer at all, and this keeps it smooth over my middle without a tank or cami.   i am an xs in most retailer to"
3116	This skirt is absolutely beautiful. the design and organza are so feminine, and i love the length. it flows beautifully and it isn't stiff or anything, but it does hold its shape well. i ordered it through the store, and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days. i think it would be easy to snag the material, so i will be really careful when i'm wearing it. the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt, and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu
3117	Purchased as a gift for someone who needs to up her pj ante -- soft cute fun
3118	This is a charming dress, with lots of quality touches, and something which is easy to wear and appropriate for many occasions. however, the dress i received wasn't quite like the dress pictured in the catalog and main website photos. the bottom buttons of the over-dress do not have matching holes, so you can't button it. this makes the v lower, and the bodice looser. it is like the photo with the brunette model on the website, rather than the primary photos with the blonde lady. personally, i w
3119	"I think these jeans are much better in person than on the picture. on the model they look a bit boxy and too loose for my taste. i am tall, slim/athletic and they fit like made for me in my usual size. they have some ""give"" and tend to get looser while you wear them, but because they are midrise they won't slide down. they are a slightly relaxed swlim fit on me. the demin is solid, the color a nice medium dark sky blue. the emobroidery and the beads are beautiful and look like they will hold up"
3120	This is a great fit and super cute, price not bad either!!
3121	Unfortunately, this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big, too shapeless.
3122	These are such a great fall staple. the silver color is the perfect grey-olive, and the texture is perfect. doesn't feel like there is extra material like most cords, and they hold their shape throughout the day. the fit is just perfect, i can finally order pants online that i know will fit just perfectly.
3123	I'm really excited that retailer is selling basics. i love the flow of this fabric and it does not cling. i haven't worn them yet but they'll be perfect for work. i look forward to trying on the other essential styles.
3124	Simple, classic, figure flattering, and reasonably priced!
3125	"This sweater is very comfortable and soft. unlike other reviewer, i did not find the lace to be itchy. i'm 5'4"", usually size 6; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel. this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted. it's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy. not sure how it's going to handle the wash."
3126	This arrived today and i am thrilled with it. the material is soft but not at all clingy. it drapes perfectly, falling just above the knee. there is a matching slip that is as nicely made as the dress itself. what a find!
3127	These are great for lounging around or even wearing to work as they can be dressed up or down.
3128	Absolutely love this cardi! it's perfect with nice jeans and boots or my black pants. i am nearly 6' tall and a medium is plenty long in the sleeve and overall length. it adds warmth but it's breathable so it doesn't give you the super hot effect when going inside. they only reason i gave a 4 in quality is that it is loosely stitched so you can get caught on things :) otherwise it is a great addition to my closet!
3129	"I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however, the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else.   sadly, dress had to be returned."
3130	This top runs large. i am usually a medium in retailer but when i read the first review, i ordered a small, and it was the right decision. i also agree that this top might be short for someone with long torso. love the back detail and the print and color is really nice!
3131	Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.
3132	I bought the grey t with the design around the yoke. it's cute, but the fabric is a little on the thin side. kind of cheap. i'm glad i didn't pay full price for it. runs true to size.
3133	There comes a point where i have to draw the line with things i purchase... i ordered this as i didn't have a black skirt, but thought ti wasn't special enough, don't get me wrong, it fits nicely, and is comfortable, but i was wowed. 0p or xs p fir perfectly, 26.5 in waist and 115 lbs. if you want ta nice casual skirt, the sale price is a good fir for the skirt, just wasn't enough for me :-)
3134	I could live in these. they are so comfy. i typically wear a 6 and got the medium. they are a little roomy. probably could have gotten a small..but i like them kinda loose and baggy. i will probably purchase another color!
3135	I'm normally a size 25p. i bought these in a 26 because i wanted a more relaxed fit. i could barely pull them up over my calves. i could get them on and button them, but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw. size up 2 sizes at least!
3136	I bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip - and i think it'll do just fine! it's a wonderful open-gauge knit - delicate and light, but substantial enough that i don't fear snagging it constantly. the cloth has a nice weight and drape, and while the fit is on the loose side, it does look intentional. wonderful as a pullover or by itself. i have the minty blue-green color, and it's divine. definitely worth the price.
3137	This dress is so beautiful! i ordered it online and when i received it i was so pleased with how it was even better in person. the fit, the embroidery, the lovely fall colors - makes this a perfect dress all the way around!
3138	"I love hte green color, it is so vribant. i tried it on in regualr size, thinking i could order petite, but they sold out... waht a bummer.  fit is very flattering, and i find it comfortable."
3139	If you have a love for vintage, romantic, feminine attire, this is the dress for you. it evokes memory of days gone by. it isn't just beautiful, the quality is superb. make sure you check the measurements for this little beauty has so stretch to it.
3140	This skirt is very stretchy and a nice soft thickish fabric. the pattern is also very cute. i ordered the xs p and it fit just right, length was pretty much as pictured, just at or slightly below the knee. the opening in front was also as shown, a bit wide, not a slit but shaped like a thin arc. overall, i still recommended it, it rusn pretty true to size (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist)
3141	"Love love love this dress! have received so many compliments on it. i'm 5'4"", 118 and xs fit perfectly. love the cap sleeves and details, super comfortable too. i can see wearing this year-round and dressing it up/down."
3142	I ordered this dress in two colors and i'm happy that i did!  very cute and great fit!  flattering too!
3143	I loved the dog on this sweater, and i rushed into the store to buy it. once i tried it on, like others, i did find it to be itchy, but that i could deal with using a tank or something. what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut. my arms looked much bigger than they are, so sadly i left it at the store. it really is a cute sweater though...
3144	I was just at the store and purchased this cute top which runs tts for me. i wasn't expecting to find anything at the store but the beautiful lace and adorable tie at the front caught my eye so i bought the small which is my usual size at retailer (34d-27-35) and it fits perfectly. the material is a touch thin but that's okay with me since i don't want heavy clothes for the warmer months anyway. i also don't find this top particularly see through as it's black and will wear a full coverage bra wit
3145	"So this is a gorgeous dress, but it seems to have too many elements. i wish they had left off the white lacy decoration at the neckline because it seems to make the dress more ""girly"" than ""sleek."" i am short, so perhaps the multiple design features would be better on a tall woman than on me."
3146	Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes, contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex, and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters, sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece!
3147	Wow im really glad i didn't listen to the negative reviews! in ordered this top in the black and red and i have to say this is one of my favorite tops! the neck line i agree does need to be secured. i wish they would have added a snap. it's fine though as i don't mind sewing it closed. this top is worth it! i'm 5'2 108 lbs and small chested. so for slim girls i think this is perfect!
3148	I ordered an xxs online and it's still massive. the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup. the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning.
3149	This dress was my absolute favorite recent retailer purchase. the fit is so flattering. i think this dress runs true to size-i usually wear a size 6 in hd in paris, and that's what size i ordered. i expect i could have fit in a 4 but the 6 is comfortable. i am 5'4'' but i ordered the regular length and it hit just above the knee. i agree that it could use pockets but no need for lining. however-- i just laundered this dress for the first time-hand wash, lay flat to dry (as recommended) and this dr
3150	The cut and design of this dress is lovely! the fabric is heavy enough for fall/winter, but the sleeveless style makes it a great transition piece for when the weather warms up again. it does run slightly larger than most other retailer dresses. i sized down to a 2 from a 4. the bust stretches a bit for the ladies who might be heavier on top (i'm a 34 dd), however, i noticed the white shows through in dark places around my bust. also, the boning in the front pushed against the fabric a bit
3151	This top is so lovely, i was worried of the color on my pale skin, but it is complementary, nice warm tones. yes, it is a tank, but i can see this as a transition piece into fall with a nice blazer, jeans, boots... the xs regular is perfect for me, length is adequate. if i were to go with petite, i might think it is too short. it is flowy, but still has shape, more than a swing top, so very flattering. the back is really cute too, definitely need a strapless for me, due to the thin straps...
3152	Love this dress - haven't worn it yet but wow the design / artwork of the fabric is beautiful !! waiting for weather to cool off a bit so can wear with my off white suede gogo boots ....
3153	I cannot believe how different this top looks in person. i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately. viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice. it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women. the cut is not too low and lays beautifully.
3154	"I'm 5 ' 5"" and 132 lbs., 34d and the size m is perfect. i will probably wear a thin, long cami under it as it is slightly see through. it doesn't gape under the arms like some sleeveless items...it fits smoothly. as the other review mentioned, it would be a perfect swim suit cover up. but i'm going to wear it more as a casual, very versatile, perfect for a hot day summer dress!"
3155	Perfect except a little snug around the hips. very forgiving silhouette.
3156	Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.
3157	This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me, the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.
3158	What attracted me to this beautiful piece is the lure of angel of the north quality and design. i know that this sweater/jacket will be worn and enjoyed this fall / winter and years to come; it's a classic beauty. when i put it on, it has a comfortable vibe, high quality, medium weight, dark black wool, and beautiful lines. i love the deep collar, slightly lower back hem, and inverted pleat at back waist to give a slight flare to the drape .it accents a feminine look and will be an invaluable st
3159	This top runs larger so size down. i love it besides that. it's adorable!
3160	Such pretty pattern and colors, pleased with dress
3161	This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of, it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it's shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.
3162	"I would describe the color as more blush. the fabric does not have a sheen as in the model picture. the fit is much cuter on than hanging. i'm a 36c and the extra small is just a bit tight in the bust, otherwise i like the fit everywhere else. i'm going to order a small and see how it fits. at 5' 3"" it's also longer on me than on the model but not a deal breaker. looks kind of 1920's vintage on. my fabric is not see through it's more of a twill fabric but not quite as heavy as that."
3163	This hoodie is really cute-i got the polka dot color and it is very soft and roomy. i am normally a small but got the medium and it fits exactly how i wanted. however-it is not a pullover and instead zips up. so odd that the pic of the hoodie is a pullover. debated returning because i wanted a pullover, but have decided to keep it because of how soft it is.
3164	I really wanted to like this since i've purchased previous byron lars dresses and have never not been complimented on them. however, the picture on this one is misleading. the colors are extremely bright, which on my pale skin makes me look washed out. for example, the border on the collar is actually more hot pink where in the picture here it appears almost white. the brightness and business just didn't work on me. that being said it still fit like a glove. 5'11 and 145 pounds and the size 4 wa
3165	More of a legging than a true pant. fits really well. grey color is great and will go with lots of things.
3166	I ordered this bra in my normal size 32d, and it fits me perfectly. this bra is beautiful. the material seems to be very high quality, and the comfort of this bra is amazing. it's definitely a keeper.
3167	"Omg! so comfortable and feels like wearing nothing at all! i wish the blue print was still available in my size. tried them on at the store and fell in love! they say the length is 31.5, however i am on the tall side, usually wear 34"" in jeans, but these are perfect. i see from other reviews that these pants have been around for a while. please don't change them, and i will be getting another pair or two next year!!!"
3168	This dress makes me feel like the princess of fall. it is very slimming. the colors are much brighter in real life. they look pastel here but are more pronounced. love this dress!
3169	I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer, actually), the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion, and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small, but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a
3170	I saw these in an email and immediately went to the web to look at them. they fit well and have nice slim look. the bottom of the legs seems to fit a little slimmer on me than in the picture, but they aren't too tight.
3171	"I got this top in navy and i love it. it's loose and flowy and comfortable, yet dressy enough to wear for work (or dress down with jeans). i'm 5'4"", 125lbs and the 6 was a bit large on me. i could've sized down a little but i actually liked the loose fit, and the length was long enough to tuck in if i wanted to. definitely recommend."
3172	The sweater is cute, but scratchy.
3173	This dress is incredible. i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it! i bought it in the navy color, it's gorgeous in person, very bright, vibrant colors. i am 5'9 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist. i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out, and got it taken in a bit. i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads, if you're thinking about buying this dress, do it, you won't regret it!
3174	Lovely embroidery with a classic look, great addition to your wardrobe.
3175	Love the wash and fit of this jean. the perfect summer go to for me.
3176	I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight, it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said, i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to, where i lo
3177	"I love this tank - the colors are great and the fit is flattering. the fabric is lightweight but not cheap or so thin that you need to wear something under it. i am 5'7"" and the length was fine for me."
3178	"I purchased these bottoms with the matching peplum top in romantic floral. i also purchased the higher waisted bottoms just in case.  i returned the higher bottoms and that's saying a lot.  i have two sons and now struggle with fit in regard to two piece bathing suits.  the higher bottoms just didn't fit right and i didn't need the extra coverage because these fit so well and the peplum gives extra coverage, though not really necessary.  the others cut in a bit in the seat and hips and these"
3179	When i saw this shirt it bought back wonderful memories of ice skating on wheatley's pond as a child where i primarily grew up in the northeast. just loved it!! i tried my normal size 4 on but it fell off my shoulders and the cuffs fell mid hand so, i tried the size 2 and it fit perfectly. i see where many say it runs small and for full busted ladies it may but i am only 34b and 116 lbs and the size 2 worked fine. it is slightly blousey in the mid section but not overly so, the fabric and stitch
3180	I noticed that someone wrote a review about how after washing her shirt, she hated it.  well, i have washed mine 2 or 3 times already and have never ironed it.  i do use fabric softener, and i take it out and hang it to dry after it has tossed in the dryer for about 5 minutes.  it is not meant to be a crisp dress shirt, but a soft casual shirt, and as i said before, i have not ironed it once.  it looks like it did when i bought it, even straight out of the dryer.  (i own the yellow and pink!)
3181	I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a 2 and because of the stretch in it, it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.
3182	I really loved how this top looked and was really excited it to get it on sale. i was worried that it might be too small/tight (i ordered a m and would consider myself a m) but was relieved to find it fit just fine. i was extremely disappointed to find that it was too sheer to wear by itself and still showed my bra with a layering tank on underneath. it was also more like a crop top for length, which does not work with my mama belly.
3183	"I love this top. it was everything i hoped it would be. it is lined so it is not see through in the chest/back; sleeves are sheer. soft. gorgeous color. love the layers. runs large so definitely size down. i am usually a m and ordered the s. i'm 5'8"" curvy 32dd"
3184	I originally bought this dress in another color back when retailer was doing the 25% off dresses promotion a few months ago. i had seen it on a store associate at my local store and absolutely loved it, but hemmed and hawed at the original price. it was a splurge even at 25% off, but as soon as i put it on i was in love. this dress is so soft. i wore it to see some old friends, and after every hug i received a comment about how unbelievably soft it was! the material is thick enough to have a decen
3185	"After multiple purchase and returns (from other sites!) i decided to splurge on a dress for my college graduation (located beach side). this dress was better than i could have hoped. the fit is very flattering, loose & tight in all the right places. the adjustable straps underneath the overlay ensure the silk lays perfectly. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light as a feather. the slight train & back buttons adds elegance to an otherwise ""casual"" floral pattern. i would highly recommend"
3186	I was looking for a dress that would make me feel as special as i would feel when i attend my daughter's baby shower. this design, featuring a variety of spring influenced flower motifs embossed upon an eyelet fabric, was exactly what my mind's eye envisioned! the use of the solid colored shirtdress button line and cuffs softly pulled all the elements of this unique work beautifully together. i found the fit to be almost costumed made for my figure. the number of compliments i received on the da
3187	"This dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice. it does have an a-line fit in the skirt. the stitching is beautiful. honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me. some may like that, but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted. the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress. the fabric is cotton and it is not lined. i am 5'9"" and it does hit right about where it does on the model. i am sending it back, because i didn't say ""wow, i love this"" w"
3188	I love these cords! soft and great fit. bought three colors!
3189	After reading the other reviews, i felt compelled to write one for this top. it is not often that i get to shop at an retailer store, but a few weeks ago, i had the pleasure. i saw this top, and while it was not on sale, i had to have it. yes, it is sheer and so you do need a camisole under it. the gold and silver embroidery is gorgeous. to be honest, this is my favorite top in my closet right now. i can dress it up or make it more casual. and, now that it's on sale, don't hesitate in this purchas
3190	"This dress is not form fitting and some might consider it a little ""shapeless"". however, the color is stunning, the quality is great, and its a great dress for a wedding where you want to stand out but not have to worry about anything too constricting. great for dancing the night away - the under layer and frill at the bottom are perfect. i am very pleased with this purchase!"
3191	This is totally different. great addition to my wardrobe!
3192	"I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid, kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so, it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer.   i would"
3193	This is a darling white top. the juxtaposition of the simple front and the beautiful lace back makes this a unique piece. definitely size down.
3194	I ordered a size small (usually i am ps) but wanted the extra length. usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time. such a cute style but made me look short & wide. unfortunately it's going back
3195	I love this dress. the pockets are great and the fabric is very soft and similar to other cloth and stone garments. i also love it's made in the usa. my only wish is that the chambray version was as great. (it's not - the pockets are cut bad, it's cut smaller in the chest, and made in china)
3196	"Tried this on in the store in a small (i'm a size 6 in most retailer dresses) and it was enormous. i'm short (5'2"") so i knew i'd need a petite size. ordered a petite small and the length is better - still a lot of fabric, but i think a petite xs would be too small if you are curvier up top (i'm a full 34d and the petite small is just slightly tight in the bust). definitely size down in this or you'll be swimming in it!"
3197	This top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price. it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it. also, the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt. still, the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans.
3198	I love the design of these. the laser cut outs are solid and hold up in the wash. they are great for work-outs and cute enough to wear as leggings out. i wore them to my bar method class, came home and just changed my top and continued wearing them the rest of the day as a cute outfit. they have a great snug fit and the fabric is thick and durable.
3199	I saw this dress online and b-lined it to the store to try on. it is a beautifully made dress. lots of great detail with stitching and beading on the front placket. feels very boho and chic. i have received lots of compliments while wearing this dress. i was almost turned off by the price, but decided to see it in person. worth every penny. wear it with sandals or tall boots, could have worn a medium, but a little tight for 38c on top.
3200	I had high hopes with the other good reviews, but you just don't know how amazing this is until you put it on! just so soft and cozy! i am so excited for more saturday/sunday products at retailer!
3201	"I have a short torso and short arms, so i purchased this in a petite medium. i probably could've worn the ps, but i do like the little extra room. it is a classic shirt dress with just enough of today's trendy ""frayed edge"" to make it contemporary. the fabric is super soft and lays nicely. i can imagine wearing this through the seasons with a variety of shoes/legwear & accessories! looking forward to it."
3202	This is a basic henley, and it is made well; a wardrobe staple, for sure. the cut is flattering, and the material is soft. i ordered the small, which is tight fitting. i'm a 34 c for reference.
3203	Super flattering! stretch a little with repeated wear but not as much as other pairs. i love these!!!
3204	I tried this sweater on in-store in grey. from front it appears like a nice, normal sweater, even a little boring. but the side and back are *wow* really fun! the colors and swing of the back material look great, especially with jeans. the front is short, making you wonder if it's supposed to be a crop top. also, the style of the sweater lets isn't very warm because the back is so loose and flowy. i couldn't decide whether to buy it or not. maybe i will wait for a sale.
3205	"This is a unique blouse and well worth a try. it is pure wool, so dry clean only. though it is wool, it is actually very thin and lightweight. i didn't find it to be scratchy. . i am a size xl, but in this blouse the large fit fine. the narrowest part of this blouse is the width of the shoulders, everything else is very voluminous. for this reason, it doesn't flatter my full figure; it makes me look much heavier than i am. my only options are to return it, or bring it to a local seamstress who"
3206	I love this piece !   i purchased it on sale months ago and when  i wear it i just love it!!  it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect it's very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing  i'm very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine  would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices   thx retailer!
3207	I was expecting this to be longer. nothing wrong with it, i will be returning it because it was a little short.
3208	I loved this but couldn't believe how small it was.
3209	Medium is equivalent to eu size 40. the pants have the eu tag and i would have ordered differently if i had known this. great quality pant; just order according to your european equivalent.
3210	I love this brand and their different styles of tshirts. extremely soft, washes well and wears well! the shirt runs a bit large and i usually wear a medium, but in this brand i am a extra small or small.
3211	This dress is the best casual find. goes with everything- flips flops, tennys, jean jacket. feels little sporty and the orange was a cool addition to my closet.
3212	I love the style of this top, and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty, and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes, unfortunately they cut the armholes really big, so when you put your arms forward, the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway, but for $98 dollars i thin
3213	"I just received this shirt in the mail, and i'm in love. it isn't your average t-shirt in that it has character and class. i can't wait to wear it! another reviewer was unhappy that the embroidery in blue on the back wasn't as dramatic as the picture; i'm not seeing it. i think the blue stands out very well. i know i should say, ""hurry and get yours before they're gone,"" but in truth, i'd rather be the only one with this beautiful shirt! :)"
3214	I really love this shirt and bought it in several colors. i wish it came in white and in black because it's a great basic. i think it also works well for business casual attire.
3215	I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7, flat chested, 135 pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer, because i do not consider myself tall.
3216	As in super comfortable and a joy to wear. i saw it online and then went to the store to try it on. the moment i put it on i knew it was for me. i missed out on getting it in the other color. i hope you get more in other colors!
3217	In retailer's defense, silk chiffon in general is super fragile. got the top in turquoise and the color and design are beautiful!! i'm 5'3 117 lbs and took an xs, fits true to size. i'm able to wear a nude strapless bra with the top and looks great. i have worn the top a couple of times and by the end of the day i had a few snags. i was able to pull the thread back inside the top, never ever cut silk chiffon. i love the top so much, i bought a second one in the same color and size as a back up. un
3218	Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.
3219	I loved this dress when i saw it online, perfect for a summer wedding, but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely, it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly, it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.
3220	Love this gorgeous off the shoulder top! very comfortable and stylish. you can wear it either off the shoulder or not!
3221	Just got the small peach in the mail; love it. also got the black small petite; works great as this shirt is pretty long. great boho tee.
3222	Beautiful fabric, great quality, fits true to size. love them!
3223	Beautiful sweater, very delicate fabric, unique design, but it runs very small. i usually wear a m, but ordered a large based on the previous review hoping that would do the trick. the sizing, along with being long waisted isn't a good combination. unfortunately, i'm returning the sweater.
3224	"It's always sunny when i wear this sunshine yellow tee.  love the color and they way it was pieced together.  has a flattering feminine fit whole still feeling relaxed and casual.  it's slightly sheer but not obscene.  all linen and a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i purchased medium and i'm 39/28/35 140# 5'3"""
3225	This top is adorable ,i finally broke down and bought it,so happy i did fits good,not too long sits at hip were it should (very flattering) i went with the reviews and sized up,i am a petite sx normally in retailer,but went with what the reviews said and got a reg small glad i did!it is a bit snug(not tight) in the chest,but has stretch to it , i am 5'1 108 33d (if you are bigger in the chest i would recommend a medium,) i got the purple motif (print) no see thru issues,the material is a comfortab
3226	The quality of the fabric and the design are perfect. i love the cut out and how flattering on my shorter figure. i am somewhere between a 6 and 8 and the 6 fit perfectly. it can also be strapless which is a sexier version.
3227	The jacket was nice and soft but it was too short on my torso with a cropped fit which i'm not a fan of that style. i returned it.
3228	I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it'd work out based on all of the good reviews. when i got it, i was happy with the fit and fabric, but i was stumped as to what i'd wear it with. it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just didn't know if i could pull off the length. i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath. it's so stretchy, warm, and cozy! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k
3229	This is a lovely dress, but much more casual than i thought from the picture. the material is very thin and casual. i needed a dressier dress, and i didn't need another casual dress, so i sent it back, but it would be fine if you want something casual.
3230	"Received this dress yesterday, love it! my initial hesitation in ordering this dress, even though it is my fav color....was rather bright for sept.. but loved it and decided to order and wear it next spring. delighted to open the package and see that the dress is much darker than in the pics...more of a jade green. it is still a summer fabric/style, however the darker color will be perfect for the warmer fall days ahead. this dress is beautifully made, superior workmanship, and the fabric i"
3231	I really love this brand and i love the fit of this blazer. my bottons were loose on this jacket and i got the rose color too and i do agree with the other reviewer that the color is more terra-cotta. great for spring and cool summer night. it runs tts im a 36dd and the medium fit nice.
3232	"Like many clothes, this looks much better on you than on the model; with a little bit of curve, it is not shapeless but very flattering. i wore it out with friends for drinks and they all exclaimed at how elegant it was. the wrist keyhole is a nice touch, and quality is very good. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs."
3233	"This t-shirt is very casual, so it is perfect for everyday use.  touch of textile is comfortable, so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this t-shirt.  although stripe is a simple design, it does not limit your choise of fashion, so it can go with almost anything.  just be aware that this t-shirt runs a little larger than the true size."
3234	This was a nice surprise because it's a thick sweatshirt type of fabric. don't be deterred! it is nothing like a sweatshirt. it's comfy like a sweatshirt though. i'm 5 feet tall 120 pounds. i ordered my usual size petite small and it fit perfectly. what little height i have is in my torso. i didn't find that the top was short at all. it's without a doubt tts. order your usual size. if you have a tummy or bootie this top is the ticket! the description on the fabric details that the other reviews
3235	Overall beautiful skirt, material is a little on the heavy and stiff side but still a really nice skirt
3236	Very comfy and flattering. cool on a hot day. slightly difficult to use the restroom, though.
3237	This is a great tee.... i bought this in the green in a size m. i'm normally a small but because of the fitted look, i opted for the medium. i probably could have sized down to the small, but the medium is still fitted just not too tight, which is actually a nice look. the only thing i wish was different are the sleeves. the sleeves are just a little too puffy for me, but it's so cute that i'm keeping it.
3238	"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 143 lbs, and 38-32-40 and my normal size 10s fit me perfectly."
3239	This sweater feels good and not itchy at all. i'm long waisted and the small hit right at my hip bone/top of my low-waisted jeans, so it's kinda on the shorter side. i liked it that way, bc it's not baggy at the bottom and is figure flattering. i tied the tie twice and thought it looked better. i have long arms and was excited the sleeves go down to the middle of my hands. it has little hole detailing down the middle, but not so much that you'd have to wear a shirt underneath.
3240	I did not have to size up or down because of my body type (broad padded back, wide rib cage, narrow hips, small bum.) however, it fits a little odd on me. the back darts that start at the waist and are supposed to curve for your behind settle too high and wrinkle. the waist is also too high. the shoulders are a bit tight. i am confused because i bought the exact same size pieced brocade (the colorful version of this dress) and that one actually fits spot on. i have a feeling if i go to the store
3241	"I love hess overalls. they are true to size and have a great vintage look to them but done in a classic way. i am 5'6"" 125lbs and a 34b. i bought the xs and it fit great! they are fitted and not sloppy like a lot of overalls. you can easily dress them up or down. soft and stretchy material is a plus"
3242	"I bought this in the white in both the sp and the mp. i am 5'2"". i ended up keeping the mp (my usually size at 36c, broad shoulders). i found that the top of the sleeves to be a bit snug and i have normal size arms. if you look at the model shots, you can see that they are tight on top. i also found this shirt to be very long, even in the petite sizing. overall, i kept it as it was slimming, quality made, and the tight sleeve hopefully won't bother me (or shrink!)"
3243	Gorgeous dress! fits true to size with high quality material. the colors are stunning.
3244	"Oh my god - i love this skirt. i first order the size 4 and immediately called customer service and had them send me a 2. i found it be be both plenty stretchy (great for moving, sitting, etc) but runs on the large size. but the fit is amazing. i love the length - a perfect knee-skimmer for me (5'9""). i love the color (green) and the pockets and button fly are so fun without being too much! i've tried it on with several tops and sweaters in my closet and this skirt is going to be one that i can"
3245	First saw this jacket in the catalog, in peach, and had to have it. i received it today, and love it. its a soft, muted peach, very neutral. i ordered xl, im usually a m-l, but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy. the quality is great, feels good on. love it so much, i just ordered it in the dark grey. very classic jacket, will wear for years. one of my favorite hei hei pieces, never disappoints.
3246	Love this dress and the color
3247	I bought a similar top by same manufacturer in fall in xs. this time it ran huge and had to order xxs which fit fine. it's very cute on.
3248	"This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (5'2""). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it!"
3249	This dress makes me this of jackie kennedy on the beach in the summertime. i love the pattern and the pockets, oh my goodness the pockets! i saw this in the store and ordered one while i was there online because the ribbon on the zipper was frayed. well guess what we i got it in the mail at home the ribbon was also frayed. ugh. i kept it because it wasn't a huge deal breaker. the color is a little strange, not a true red more of a orangish red. i think it's super versatile and hopefully i will w
3250	This sweater is beautiful! not only is the lace front gorgeous, but it is incredibly comfortable and so well crafted. definitely my favorite cardigan now.
3251	"Soft and flowy. fit is great. quality is great. i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well. i haven't worn a dress in 10+ years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first. highly recommend. i paired this with 4"" short black suede boots and black tights. many compliments (even from my husband and he doesn't usually pay much attention)."
3252	"I just purchased these pants in red on sale. i am 5/5"", 143 pounds, and the 10 fit perfectly (i am either an 8 or a 10 in pants, depending upon brand). it is really hard for me to find pants that are cute, unique, work-appropriate, and flattering. these pants fit the bill in all aspects. i thought i would prefer the black, but am really glad i got the red."
3253	I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline, so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale, but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves. they were right! the way it's seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that it's incredibly flattering. the fabric is light enough for warm weather, though it may be too heavy for hot weather. it's soft and has a very flattering n
3254	"At last, in a world of loose, billowy silhouettes, a draped top that falls a little closer to the body! the fabric is of good weight and has the right amount of stretch.  i also love the retro/vintage pattern of the fabric itself. the fit is feminine and comfortable.  you will have to wear a camisole with this top, but i do not consider that a negative. it is the way of the deep v neck."
3255	I was so happy to find this in extra small. it is such a cute loose fitting top.. very soft and flowy tank. the orange color is so pretty. i went down a size in this top
3256	I absolutely love everything about this top! i bought it in the taupe/navy stripes version and got compliments the first time i wore it. i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all, but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer. the neckline and sleeves seem tailor-fitted for my body. i don't often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect length/shape to be incredibly flattering. they're in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regular-length. the neckline is eq
3257	I ordered these jeans to wear to work since they are very dark and tailored. my usual size 26 fit perfectly, but they did have to go to the tailors since they were incredibly long, which is nice for those of you that need more length.given that i usually am in skinnies, i like how they fit singly on the hips and slightly flare out towards the bottom, but not too much. these will work well with a variety of looks, making the price tag well worth it.
3258	I'm not in love with this, but the husband thinks it looks cute and the sale price isn't bad so i'm keeping it. i got it in s, and am usually an xs or s in retailer tops (34b, 26 inch waist, 120lbs). if i had gone with xs it probably would've been too tight in the shoulders. however i could be 6 months pregnant and you wouldn't know it. it is very boxy in the torso, and i realize the design is for it to be flowy, as the back is partially split. but it looks relatively fitted on the model, which is
3259	I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.
3260	This pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin. i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool doesn't bother me too much. i'm not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress, even with the slip, which doesn't cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off. i decided to keep and wear as an autumn/winter dress in which i will remove the slip, wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea
3261	"I decided to try this dress on based on the other reviewer's positive words, and i wasn't disappointed! it's so cute and stylish. i plan to wear with black boots. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34c, wear a 2 or 4, and i got a 4. one thing - at the waist, the pattern breaks a bit and doesn't match perfectly. i tried on a second dress and liked its pattern more than i did that of the first i tried."
3262	"Dress just arrived and i was a bit nervous of the fit based on the other six reviewers stating it runs small. i actually found it to run exactly true to size. i'm 5'6"" 38-26-38 slender, and on average i wear a size 6, which is what i ordered - 6 regular and it fits as though it was custom made for me. this dress is made very well - looks tailored and hits me right above the knee similar to the model. i feel i scored big by purchasing it at the sale price."
3263	"This is my new favorite dress. while elegant it isn't too fancy for a nice office environment. very comfortable and a perfect size fit. i would like it if it was in petite only to make it hit above my knee, not below since i am 5' 3"" but not a big deal. everyone has complimented this dress!"
3264	This dress is made very well and can be dressed up or down! it can be worn with open toe wedges in spring and summer and cute booties in the fall.
3265	This is the perfect tank for everyday but it looks like you've dressed up a bit. i love the flow and the ruffles and it looks super cute with a pair of skinny pants. really comfortable and it is good quality.
3266	"So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5""6"" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition."
3267	Walked in intending to purchase another jacket and ended up leaving with this one. the color is advertised as grey, but it's actually more like a light mocha. the slightly darker fabric on the side and around the waist accentuated my curves and i believe it would help give the illusion of an hourglass figure to those who are more straight and slender. i generally wear a size 12 and m or l size tops depending on the designer. i purchased the l in this case because that's all that was available at
3268	I loved this dress and wanted to use it for work. i read the reviews and saw all the issues with the slip and was nervous, but i tried it anyway and figured i could use another plain black slip i have if the one with the dress didn't fit. i'm really happy i did because it's a gorgeous dress. you just may need to wear a different black slip with it (i did). if you already have one, it's no additional hassle or cost and the dress is really unique. it's the perfect comfortable but stylish dress for
3269	Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite, might work on someone taller.
3270	I was nervous about this purchase, but it turned out to be a new favorite. the blue color is stunning on and i can easily see this taking me from work to dinner. i am normally a size 2 or 4 in dresses. after reading reviews about how this dress runs large, i ordered a 2 and hoped i didn't have to return it. the 2 is perfect and roomy. the drawstring can be let out or in for more figure definition. this really is a beautiful and modest dress.
3271	I was so ready to love this dress but it runs extremely small - like you should maybe purchase a size 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear.
3272	I have not owned a denim jacket of this kind in...15 years? i have a wonderful pilcro chambray jacket with a military cut from last year, but this kind of boxy, straight up denim jacket cut has not been a part of my life for a while. however, i was in a store last weekend and with the additional 25% off, i thought it might be wise to give this a try. i'm so glad i did. i've now tried it over two fairly girly dresses, with tights and booties (it's not exactly spring in boston yet), and i love it.
3273	This top is beautiful and i really wanted to be able to keep it - i've tried it on 3 times. it is not for big-chested girls (34ddd) - it hangs like i'm 20 months pregnant because the top area lands on top of my chest. sadly this will be going back. it is beautiful and flowing and a perfect weight.
3274	I got the floral suit and honestly, it's the most beautiful bathing suit i have ever owned. i have yet to wear it to the pool or beach so i don't know how it holds up when getting wet. i can see where other reviewers have said there is no support in the chest. it is padded which is nice, but no underwire or anything to hold the girls up. if you are big chested this could be an issue - not so much for me. :) looking forward to wearing this suit when the weather gets warmer!
3275	"This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size, it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out.   the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust."
3276	"I love everything about this dress! i love the colors - style and fit. it is so comfortable. i had so many people ask where i got it.  i usually wear an xs or s in retailerpolgy dresses and i got this in an xs and it was perfect."
3277	This top is beautiful. everything about it is beautiful. it has lovely detail on the back as well as the front. i chose a size 12 which seems to run true. it fit. however, regretfully i had to return the top. i came back here hoping i could find it in ivory or black... but there's only one color. the dusky rose is lovely, but i'm blonde and true pink is fine; this shade not so good, although as someone else here commented, it is a stunning shade of pink, very unusual -- like old dried roses. i l
3278	Bought this dress for a wedding in petite. fits true to size. beading & embroidery is beautiful in person. only downside is that the beads & embroidery are very delicate and damage even when sitting on a chair.
3279	They're the same quality and fit as my hyphens from last year. easy purchase!
3280	I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans, and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like, but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer, i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.
3281	I got this in the grey and wore it the day i opened the package. one side is see through, so i wore a camisole underneath. it's lightweight and not at all clingy. i normally like my shirts in medium and this was true to size for me. perfect sweater for a fall day in new england.
3282	I did not notice this dress on the website. it was not until i saw it in store (was an online purchase & returned) - i was immediately in love. i love the color, texture and rosettes. i feel like a million bucks wearing it and have received so many compliments on it. before buying it, i actually ran home to gather a previous purchase and return it so i could buy this dress and not feel guilty! i am usually a 2 or 4 and the 6 fits perfect through and through. so happy with this lovely dress!
3283	This dress is super cute - and fits tts for retailer. i ordered my usual size small and it fit me great everywhere, however the arms are much shorter and hit me either wrong, or the model in the picture is just very,very small. i'm 5'10, 136#, 36aa, slim built and the dress fits, but the arms bunch up -- if i ordered a medium the entire dress would be too baggy (and it is a loose fitting shift). bummer, bc it is super cute! also, the material is loose crochet - my dress arrived with a pull. sad fa
3284	I ordered these without reading the previous reviews and i would have to agree with everything everyone has already said. these are the cutest cords i've seen in a long time! they're definitely skinny, bridging on way too skinny through the calves but i'm willing to stick it out. the thing that bugs me about them is how stinking short they are?? the description doesn't really mention that they're crops but at this length any ankle bootie is going to be too short. also, they aren't navy. they're
3285	Pic doesn't do it justice, very flattering. i got it in navy. definitely worth the sale price!
3286	Nice loose-fitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall. i had no problem with the slip being too tight. 5'3'', 118lbs, and went with my normal size 2. it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders. it's great with boots or flats!
3287	I ordered this top in the pretty, sea glass green color. it is adorable on! it's constructed from a nice thick cotton and has a billowy swing look if you are into that, which i am. the cut of the neckline gives it a cool 60's vibe. my only issue is that the arm holes are cut small. also note that because of the wider neckline, i found putting a necklace on squashed it in a strange way. i'm still keeping it because it is awesome in every other aspect. most likely i will just jazz it up with fun e
3288	I?ve been looking at this dress online for some time now, but i?ve been put off by the photo of the woman wearing it on the boat. it just did not seem right. but then i saw it in the store and i was sold on it. it is a wonderfully soft, linen dress. it is a bit tight in the midriff, so i had to size up a bit. i usually wear a size 2, but went with size 4 this time. size 4 fit perfectly. it is comfortable, easy to wear, just the right amount of sexy. it will be a nice every day dress for summer i
3289	I really want to love this shirt, but the small is just way too big on me. for reference, i'm a 32d (which is why i didn't want to size down much more than a small), 5'6' and 125 and i'm drowning in this. i'm going to try it with different bottoms and ultimately will keep it because i do love the quality. just size down a couple of sizes!!
3290	I ordered this shirt in both white and coral. i absolutely love the design and coral color. the white was a bit see through, so i returned it. it would be cute with a cami under, but i just wanted something that did not require an extra layer. overall, it is a flattering fit and i love the detail on the back.
3291	"Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist, creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress.  why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo."
3292	This romantic top has lovely embroidery and beading details. i purchased this in purple, which is actually more of a cranberry color. i like that the detail work carries over to the back on the cap sleeves.
3293	Love this top! so soft, fits perfect.
3294	This is probably the softest, most flattering hoodie that i have ever worn. i can dress it up or down and it has drapes really beautifully. great for spring & summer, love it as a coverall at the beach. my partner rarely compliments my clothes and actually told me how much he liked the way it looked on me. highly recommend.
3295	"I loved the color and the neckline was flattering. however, it would have fit me better in a petite size bc i am 5'3"" and a 32f. it fits slim so to fit in my bust it was too long. also didn't think the fabric was good quality for this price."
3296	Cute top, great for the inner maid marian fan. :) fun twist on t-shirt in regular size. also ordered the alexandria top in somewhat similar vein, but didn't care for that one at all. this one was cute and the fit is flattering. the other is boxy and boring to me. recommend this one.
3297	Just tried this on in store. the color in the photo is wayyyyy off. it's a hunter green and dark navy zigzag. for maeve it runs large. i am usually a medium or a 10 and a s worked best. i'm a 36d and there was no pull at the bust. will pick up when on sale (bc a hundo for rayon is laughable).
3298	This was surprisingly more complimentary and easier to wear than i though it would be. i love vix bathing suits and the quality is exceptional!
3299	This dress is just lovely. beautiful drape, comfortable material. it is a print that looks like embroidery. i am usually an xs or s, and i'm glad i got the xs as i can tell the s would have been too large. the back waistband is elastic and it is easy to move in. beautiful neutral colors. i think it can be dressed up or down easily with the right shoes and jewelry. only negative comments- there is only a half slip and i wish it was lined more, although that will make it easier to wear during the
3300	I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool, soft, not itchy, light weight, lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th
3301	Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like i'm pregnant (not that there's anything wrong with that) very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf.
3302	I really liked the dress on line, but, i didn't appreciate how lovely it was until i received it. it fit perfectly, and has a lovely flare at the hemline for a flirty feel. i wear it with taupe colored booties and it is perfect for work and afterwork.
3303	I love everything about this jumper - it's so comfortable without being too warm. it's easy to dress up with booties and a hat. i suppose the only possible downside is that it's slightly tight at the ankles, but honestly - this is like a dream.
3304	"Couldn't make it work, even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan, like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all, just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust), then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy, curvy waist, but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape. (5'3'' 127lb 34a, tried xs)"
3305	Great top for the older woman who wants to be stylish but needs a little extra room. the subtle color goes with anything. i love it!!
3306	I love this suit. the color is stunning and the quality of the material is excellent. a one piece never looked so good!
3307	I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!
3308	I love this top! i have all 4 colors in size large. i'm 5'9 170 lbs with a large bust. it's a loose fit that is very flattering. do not dry i wash in cold water and hang dry. first one i bought i dried and it shrunk quick a bit. if you are tall, size up.
3309	"The pics online for this dress are horrible in comparison how stunning this dress is in person. just received it and far exceeded my wildest expectations! it is elegant, classy, and an understated sexy! the colors are rich and vibrant.......gorgeous shades of plum and blue....a unique color combination that is gorgeous! the open mess dress with the solid under layer is a wow! beautiful and flattering fit. it is a 10 !!!! i ordered my usual size and i would say it is true to size, but slig"
3310	This looks sooooo much better on, than on the hanger/in the picture. i bought the grey, and it is the most comfortable tunic i've ever worn. it is light, airy, and so easy to wear. i wish it came in more prints/colors, cause i'd buy another one, in a skinny minute! if you don't try this on, you're missing out on a surprisingly awesome wardrobe piece. you can wear it year-round with jeans, pants, a vest, wrap, scarves, leggings, boots, sandals or anything else, and it looks chic and whimsical. go
3311	At the beginning of the season i lusted over an ivory haute couture side-sliced tunic so much that i almost sprang for the $800 price tag. when i saw this at retailer, i realized it was similar, but had certain design elements that made it even more unique than the other. i just received it, and i was not disappointed! that cable neckline is beautiful, the 3/4 sleeves are perfect to show off a bracelet or two, and whether worn with skinny jeans, as shown, or wide leg trousers (as the haute
3312	I got this when it went on sale (in navy and coral colors), awesome dress for any occasion! as far as complaints go about the straps, its meant to be low-cut! i really like the basket weave bodice although that does make it more difficult to zip up, but i found it was easier to just slip the dress on zipped up since the stretchy fabric gives quite a bit rather than deal with the zipper. i normally wear about a 0-2 in most retailer brands and have the dress in both sizes (didn't notice a big differ
3313	"I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3"" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p"
3314	I'm 5' 120 lbs. i'm posting a photo. one lady was concerned about it being ok for the over 40 crowd. i wore it was a cami under. see pic. it is comfy. it has pockets and fits beautifully. i ordered a 6petite. it's a little long on me. buy i still like it and am enjoying wearing it.
3315	I have gotten so many compliments on this blouse! material is very comfortable and the fit is great!
3316	"I love this sweater. i found it in the sale section a few weeks ago but wasn't sure if it would be too bulky. it had a dark smudge on the collar left from someone or something. i thought maybe it had been left behind by others for that reason because the quality was so nice. thankfully, i washed it and the smudge came out.    i live in houston, tx and don't need to wear wool or cashmere sweaters for warmth. this is mostly cotton. it is well made. the sleeves were longer on me than the model,"
3317	"This skirt fits great. the thick material helps it lay nicely and smooth the curves. i'm 5-4"" about 130lbs, athletic build with a bottom and the med fit well."
3318	I saw this top online and read the reviews that it was running small. i am normally an xxs in most retailer clothing. i am 5'6 110 for reference. found it in the store and took both the xs and small in to try on. the reviewers were right! i tried the xs on first and it was quite snug and short. the small fit perfectly. it was a bit longer too. great style and soft fabric. once you size up, you'll love it...
3319	I saw a review from another petite person who said this runs small, but i'm my case it ran true to size. it's a very flattering dress and easy to wear for any occasion.
3320	I got this top in white and it is cute. the fabric is a weird kind of polyester, and kind of shiny. i got the medium and it pulls a little around the chest. overall i like it.
3321	Beautiful fit and true to size. highly recommend. they are long and you will need to have them hemmed but they are soft and feel amazing on.
3322	I know this is supposed to be a loose, flowy fit which is exactly the style i love. however, this is beyond tent-like. i'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small. fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper. huge bummer, especially after seeing a few 5-stars.
3323	I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.
3324	The dress is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is light, the pattern is not overwhelming and has a zipper on the side to make it more fitted in the waist. the top is blousy, but i am only a c cup and it still was perfect. the bottom has an uneven cut that makes the dress very interesting. i love it. i am usually a size 2 or 4 and the size 4 was perfect.
3325	"This dress is beautiful. i am happy i chose the sky blue color. i read a review before ordering that said it was more beautiful in person. it certainly is! i can't wait to wear it. the only issue is that it runs a tad bit too big. i am very thin, and usually an xs in retailer clothes. i could've fit an xxs. good thing the straps can tie and be adjusted. also, it is a little longer than i thought it would be on me (i am 5'7""). other than that, i love this dress."
3326	"Lovely pants, incredibly comfy fabric, but too short for 5'11'' people. stated inseam of 31.5 is a bit understated, but it is clearly not 34"" that i need. had to take it back to the store."
3327	This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this
3328	This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.
3329	"I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it! the fabric is a great weight- flowy, but still substantial enough. with nude undergarments, i can't see anything. in fact, that is one of the things i love; no special undergarments are required, so it is very comfortable and still very flattering. i typically wear a medium- 135 pounds, 5'4"", 34b, 28 waist, 40 hip. i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big. i would have bought it, but the salesperson suggested i try"
3330	I love how pretty and soft this shirt is. it falls well. i want to wear it everyday.
3331	Cute top, wish they had xxs. looks great with jeans and a fun necklace like pix. i got an xs (5'4 and 135 lbs) and it's still a little wider than i would prefer, but i'm not a skinny jeans gal so might look better with those. i decided to keep it since no xxs. wore all day with jeans for a more casual event, then added a skirt and high heels later for a theater show. super comfortable and looks great for all occasions.
3332	Very pretty. runs true to size. waist is higher than in the photo, as other reviewers have stated. correct fit is important because the arm openings are a little big, i thought, and when i sized up to try to get the waist a little lower, the arms were too large.
3333	"I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm, no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b, weigh 110 pounds, 5'3"" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!"
3334	I saw online and bought in white and moss! moss is darker in person. i am 106, 5'1 but a 30f and the top fits very well. it actually minimized my chest which i love! not sure how well this would fit on small-chested ladies. not super clingy in the midsection but will look nice with pants or skirts. super happy!
3335	Really love this blouse for several reasons....it fits! pretty true to size depending on how fitted you want it. not too much of a difference between a 6 or 8. it is a bit sheer but i am not worried about it. now my favorite part is the tie in the middle.....finally not a boxy waist, it's up to you to pull it in or loosen. the length is perfect...not too long so it works over skirts too. it is soft. my only concern is how long will it last. will require careful washing and ironing. may end up pu
3336	This is a lovely cardigan--especially over dresses with leggings, over-the-knee socks, and boots. i was so ecstatic to get it at the black friday price. the description says its white but it's more like a cream. it was for this reason that i initially reconsidered the purchase. i was hoping for more of an off-white or winter white as it appears on the model. except, it looked so great over dresses and suitable for the southern california winter. i didn't care for the wrap belt. it just looked li
3337	Really nice, substantial, fully lined sweater coat. i love the structured look and the faux-leather piping around the zipper and the pockets. quality seems to be very good. it runs true to size, maybe slightly on the small side (especially for larger hips/busts) so if you are in between sizes, go up. i chose small and it's just right; i wouldn't be able to zip around my hips with xsmall. besides the price, which is why i dropped one star, i cannot really find any fault in this sweater coat.
3338	Great pants! great fall colors. great for day or night. super fun and funky. love them!
3339	Corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit well....even with stretch added. so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif mid-rise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great! they were long enough as well. i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived, it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones. how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well. these are not old lady pants either...how nice!
3340	Great spring time dress that looks good with a thin top, a cardigan or by itself. the fit is a bit loose but not oversized in my usual size, so if you want a slimmer silhouette or you are not busty, i would size down. love the fabric as it has some give despite its thickness. i would have paid full price but i'm lucky to have purchased on sale.
3341	I love this cotton weave shift dress. it is supposed to be loose and not tight. i purchased a medium and fits the way i see it should fit. ref: 34dd, 148 lb; 5'4 height. hits above the knee but office appropriate as not too short. i paired it with a few seasons ago, the navy blue suede fringe jacket by retailer elevenses; new necklace in the blue motif from retailer ( it has a hanging druzy pendant) navy hose and navy crew neck long sleeve top.  great outfit for work and an after work party at retailer
3342	Tried it on a whim and could not leave it behind. 5/4', 135, size 4-6, took a 6. something about the pocket placement, fabric weight, cut, and color make this one a real winner for me. plan to wear it with a creme windowpane coat.
3343	Dress runs a little small in the arms but flows nicely on the body. see through and comes with slip but slip is stiff and doesn't give. was hard to get on so i wore my own slip. other that that, dress is feminine and looks great on!
3344	I was drawn to this sweater for its vibrant colours and unique pattern. i tried it on and immediately fell in love with the comfort, quality, and design. it is a little short, but this minor issue is easily fixed with by wearing a neutral colored undershirt/camisole. the cuffed sleeves reveal a matching pattern and can be rolled down or up. i usually wear a xs or s in retailer's clothes, but i sized up to a m on this one. definitely worth it. this is a festive winter piece that can be dressed up o
3345	This sweater is gorgeous! the color is a true periwinkle which really attracted me to it. the bell sleeves are a nice change. i have very long arms and they fit perfectly. i could wear this sweater out.
3346	As with most retailer tops, this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle.  i ordered an xs.  it's a very nice, pretty sweater that i'm going to try in an xxs.  the v-neck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath. the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale.  the white is a soft winter white.
3347	"Would recommend, but with the caveat that i had to return due to the pants being way too big all over, even the length was more than i expected from the photos online. i am 5'5"" 120lbs narrow hips, usually a 25 in pants (including other level 99 pants i own). i ordered a 25 and i could have pulled them off completely buttoned, plus they went nearly to my ankles. anyhow, the material is really nice, soft and comfy, color was good (i ordered the dark), and i could imagine they would be super cute"
3348	This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more. it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days. it fits tts. well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay ( as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with). the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail.  sure to sell out.
3349	"This is a wow dress as far as fit if you are a voluptuous or hourglass figure  woman. i have  a 38inch bust and the medium fit perfectly...the whole dress fit perfectly. i'm so glad i took a risk and ordered it. i wish it was made from a better material  like cotton versus polyester, but it has such a nice fit that i'll forgive the material choice."
3350	Cute casual drawstring short. runs a little large but nice style for an oversized look. nice length for long legs.
3351	I love seafolly boyleg bathing suits. i find them very flattering and just universally appealing. this one has beautiful summery design as well. i found it to be running slightly smaller than plain colored editions of this suit. i normally wear size 6 (us size) of this suit, but this particular design 6 was too small and had to exchange for 8(us) which fits perfect.
3352	"Pros. 1) the color and texture of this skirt are gorgeous. twice as pretty as the photo . 2) you could wear this with almost any color top, black boots and youve got a great outfit! 3) the black side panels make this a very figure flattering skirt.  cons this skirt is unlined. because it's a knit skirt on some mesh it's slightly seethrough. i'll wear it with a slip, but seriously for this price it should be lined"
3353	This is a great dress for all body types. the fabric is substantial and soft.  i sized down for a closer fit, but i could have also bought my usual medium and had the extra space to belt it and wear a looser fit. i busted out the boots, a little early, and the outfit was done.  super easy to wear, dressed up or dressed down.  totally worth the price, i'm glad i didn't wait until it went on sale for fear of selling out.
3354	Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape, but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long, but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.
3355	Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.
3356	I knew i had to have these when i saw them on one of the retailer store instagrams. i bought them in the blue color combo and they are very comfortable and can be dressed up for work or paired with more casual clothing because of the material. they run a little large and have a lot of stretch so i would size down.
3357	Cute staple in classic style overall.  fabric weight is good, will be able to get by with nude bra.  many wardrobe options with this staple.
3358	I wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm. they get the job done and for an incredible price. they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside. i'm not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but it's subtle and i don't mind it. they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots, the length not a problem. my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg. retailer kindly sent me a new pair for
3359	This dress is chick but funky! the material is knit but not the usual itchy knit. it's comfortable and cool. the colors of the stripes are cool - they're earthy and go well with black, brown, blue and gray. this is going to be a favorite for years.
3360	This shirt is nice and flowy. it can be dressed up or down. very lightweight for summer, but the color will work for early fall too.
3361	"These pants fit me perfectly..i am 5'7"" and 134 (most days).. and wore a 4..they are so comfortable, i could sleep in them. they do stretch a little after wearing (linen), which can be a good thing to some...they are a heavier linen so good for mild winters..almost look denim..if they came in more colors i would get more!they also remind me of my old hippie days, which was fun"
3362	Love the way this feels ? epic and flowy and flattering ? and features my shoulders and de-emphasizes shape and size from waist down. waited for it to go on sale and it paid off. i'm wearing it to a wedding this weekend. i can't wait to show it off! highly recommended.
3363	The first day i wore this jacket to work, three people told me how great it looked. it's stylish but comfy, looks great worn with a tunic and leggings or accompanying a skirt and tights. best of all, the camel color is a great change from black and as a bonus, doesn't show my orangeish lab's dog hair!
3364	So much prettier in person! beautiful colors matched together! so light and relaxing! love at first sight!
3365	I bought this dress for the kentucky derby. i was worried about wearing navy to an event known for bright colors, but the gorgeous lace and rosettes are light and beautiful. i paired it with a lavender hat, and i was ready for a mint julep! i usually wear a 2 or a 4, so i ordered both. the 2 fit best. i will be wearing this dress to a wedding in the fall and for many events for years to come. stunning!
3366	I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large, as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also, the layering looks nothing like it does on the model, it looks sloppy, unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist, otherwise it just doesn't wor
3367	Such a great dress! it is super flattering. i love that its not too short on me(i am 5'11).
3368	Comfortable with leggings or cropped skinnies. would be better as a solid as opposed to a plaid print. breathable and airy fabric.
3369	I wanted to love this dress! i ordered it when there was a 20 percent off special and couldn't wait to get it. the colors are as depicted and the dress fit true to size. i also liked that it wasn't too short. what i didnt like was that the dress is lined in white, which you can plainly see in the picture, but i didnt notice before ordering. i just think it would have been much prettier lined in black. im disappointed and the dress is going back.
3370	I love this blouse! it is such a classic silhouette. the fit is not so loose on me as the model, but i have a much more curvy figure at a size 14/large. i am completely coverd up in this top, and the waistline is incredibly flattering to a full figure. the lace makes this top easily able to go from dressy to casual. i can see myself wearing this top again and again. great purchase.
3371	I saw this shirt in store a while ago, but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it. however, when it went on sale and there was an extra 40%, i decided to get it. i like the top, it's cute and fun. however, it does poof out a little in the midline. this top goes great with jeans or shorts, and it is cute, but definitely not worth full price for this.
3372	"I just recently purchased this skirt and i love it! it's cotton with spandex incorporated, so it's soft and not stiff. it hugs your waist and accentuates your butt nicely. the lace up is unique in design, so it can be dressed up with a sparkle blouse or dressed casual in a t-shirt. i'm 5' 1"" in height so the length is very flattering and it zips up in the back. great color cream and excellent quality."
3373	Very flattering and love style, print and color. i sized up one size and perfect fit. great with page grey wash skinny mid rise jeans.
3374	I am wearing a large in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
3375	"These literally are more comfortable than sweatpants. they are definitely ""relaxed"" and look a little baggier on than in the photo, but still cute and flattering."
3376	"These pants have a really cute design. however, they are a bit short (and i'm only 5'4""). i'm still happy i purchased them, but i thought i was purchasing full length pants (as shown on the model) and not capris."
3377	"I saw this dress online and i ordered immediately! it has everything i love: my fav color, a peplum and feminine cut out details. i ordered my usual size medium, and it was too tight in the chest, and i am just average... 34c. loved it so reordered in a size large. if you are thinking of purchasing this beauty i would suggest going up a size if you are on the upper end of your size (medium 8/10 and i am usually a 10 so needed to go up) the reason i gave the quality a lower rating is that the med"
3378	"I bought the burgundy color in this shirt dress. usually wear a size 4 and xs in most brands. purchased the xs in this dress. i'm 5'4, 118#, 34d. the fabric is rayon however it feels more like a light flannel or soft brushed cotton. like you've worn it forever. the length says 40"" long but i found when worn with the belt it rides up substantially. about 2-3 inches above the knee. felt like i was squirming to pull it down. i normally wouldn't be drawn to something so simple but when i walked out"
3379	The blouse is gorgeous. the detail to the blouse is outstanding and it is very feminine. from the pictures, front and back, there appears to be flow to it and room. however, my general size m was absolutely gigantic. it was like a tent. i was speechless when i looked in the mirror. i debated tapering it and then thought that's just too much effort. i'm going to return and see if i can order in 2 sizes smaller. i'm 5'1 and a 36c, if this helps.
3380	I tried these on in in a 27/4 in the store and they were a bit snug. they graciously offered to look online and found the 28/6. they arrived in less than a week and are perfect. a note was enclosed saying they actually ran out of this size but another store was able to find them and ship...i love that retailer did not even call and worry me over it, they just fixed the problem. thank you!
3381	Love these. wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots. nice subtle print. i think they run about 1 size small. i'm normally a size 0/25. the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled. size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough. incidentally, i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too. love love
3382	I like this top a lot, and have always liked knotted looks around the bust area. i do not have a large chest, and this kind of top always draws attention in all the right places. i was worried the cut would be too low for my comfort level-and it is low but the shirt does not come away from my body in normal movements so i do feel completely comfortable wearing this without a cami underneath. i don't prefer this in black because i think the color detracts from the bunches of fabric created by the
3383	This is one of the best things i have ever bought from anrtho. it is very flattering, and i always get compliments when i wear it. must have!
3384	The blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure
3385	Love this top, i would have bought two but the grey is sold out in my size. very comfortable and true to size.
3386	I love ag jeans to begin with but even still sometimes certain styles miss the mark (at least on my body type). i was pleasantly surprised with this pair and even though they are pricey, i couldn't pass them up. they miraculously stay on my hips and i don't find myself pulling them up every few minutes. hallelujah! other than that they are  stretchy and soft with out losing their shape. they hit right at the ankle for me (5'2). the hem is frayed which i'm hoping doesn't unravel too much with was
3387	Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.
3388	Great green color. drapes well. nice gray detailing adds dimension to an already pretty sweater.
3389	"I thought this was adorable on the model, but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan, but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs."
3390	This blouse drapes nicely. the 8 in the store was too big which is not what i usually find with maeve. i wear a 6 or small in most blouses. i ordered the 6 and it was still too big, so i hope the 4 will work.
3391	"These are great-looking chinos and very comfortable. i'm 5'11"" and--unrolled--they are long enough for me."
3392	"As soon as i saw this dress i ordered it...i didn't want to miss out on it. i loved the look...the colors were so fun and bright...i thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii. i am 5'4"" about 118#. i ordered a pxs. when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric. i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful. part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c"
3393	"Love this dress! i can't say enough about it. comfortable, stylish, packable! doesn't wrinkle at all. i love it. i bought the neutral and the turquoise. only planned on keeping one but i love it so much i'm keeping both. good dress for fall/winter to wear with flats or tights and boots. can easily be dressed up or worn casual. i am 5'1"" 115 lbs and bought the xs petite. perfect fit. a great price point especially with the 25% off dresses."
3394	The shirt is great, aside from the fact that it runs very large. i ordered an xs when i usually wear a s and it is still very big on me. the color is great though, and the fabric is more comfortable than i expected. i still wear it occasionally with pants or skirts that i can easily tuck it in to.
3395	Perfect fit. though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami. i absolutely recommend this shirt. it fits tts.
3396	I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8, and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight, but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d
3397	"I found this dress to run large (like the other reviewers have mentioned). the quality is really nice, and the sweater fabric is a nice touch. it hit me right above the knee, and i an 5'5"". it is a purplish pink (as pictured). if it fits you properly, you will be pleased with the quality, color and unique style."
3398	This twist front top fits true to size, it is perfect! i really love the ruched sides, i like a longer tankini but most of them the stomach area is too wide and flowy. this one is perfect, it hugs your sides and looks great to wear with my kids but still flirty with my husband! i got the navy top and the side tie bottoms in navy/periwinkle and they are so cute together, can't wait to hit the beach!!
3399	Just picked this up at my retailer and i just love it. its totally different than your typical tee. the bottom is more of a blousy silk material and the top is a super soft knit. it lays really well and is long enough to wear with leggings! my favorite part is the t strap in the back. such a beautiful detail and so much fun. my only criticism with this top is where it hits on the bust. im a little more full figured, so the top looks better on me when the silk part isn't under my boobs. kinda have
3400	This lovely skirt absolutely hits the mark for quality. it is a substantial weight for fall, a deep vivid blue color, and just the right length to wear with boots.  it was a trifle snug in the waist. i would have kept it anyway, but the oversized pockets stuck out on either side in an awkward way.  at this price, it just wasn't right for me.
3401	These citizens of humanity jeans are indeed pricy but worth the money. they fit slim through the hips and not too loose in the legs to make you feel like they are huge...very versatile and look fabulous with a cropped sweater or even a hip length top. add a pair of chunky shoes and you have a great look. i even tried them with dansko clogs and they looks cute. it's a great break from skinny jeans and much more chic than boyfriend jeans.
3402	"Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint. i ordered a xxs in black, and it was perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs. it definitely has a lot of volume to it, but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer, so you can ""see"" through it to your thinner figure underneath. it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it, which makes it flattering. another reviewer mentioned the beading turning. i have not seen that on mine, but now i will be looking for i"
3403	"This is a beautiful quality knit. i do wish that it was a tad bit longer...i'm 5'7"" with a long torso and found it to hit like the model shot. since the sweater flares a little at the bottom, i think it might be more flattering a little longer. keeping this regardless because it will still get plenty of wear."
3404	Nice jeans, just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them. that's why i returned them. otherwise, fine.
3405	I bought this top in slate. it is very nice, looks so flattering and good with a light pant. it runs large though and is loose fitting, like a swing top. i like the design at the top. i will try the mauve in the store. i really like this top and recommend it for casual wear. very comfortable and soft.
3406	This sweater is far more slouchy and relaxed in fit than in it seems in the photograph. definitely size down. honestly, i kinda love it anyways! the inside is so very soft, and it's perfect for a sleek errand-running or hiking kind of day!
3407	"I'm usually a small (5'5"", 116 lbs, long torso), but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures, but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close, mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however, it is rather short, possibly because it is an x-small, and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom, which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect"
3408	Comfortable and flattering for all body types...good for both day and evening...
3409	Such cute, soft and comfortable shorts. can be worn as night wear or out and about.
3410	I tried this in my normal sp. i found it to run a little snug, but the neckline was way too low for every-day wear.
3411	Awesome top. slightly cropped. great to dress up jeans or wear with pants or skirt for evening out.
3412	It is a beautiful coat, runs small. arms feel tight, i am typically xs, i can't even button it up. bottom is skirted, and falls beautifully. it is light weight coat, not really fit for cold weather.
3413	This is s very comfortable cami with comfortable and nicely designed straps in back.
3414	Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper, trouser-like pant--this is not it!
3415	I love the design of this and the pattern! it's comfy but a bit too much side boob for actually swimming. i like a bit more coverage, the front has great coverage but on the side... whoa!!!
3416	Love this dress! purchased it online, the xl sizes can be difficult to find in the store. dress is very cute on and you don't need to be reed thin like the model. it flatters the figure and yes, i wore spank with it. the length is good, the design (black and neutral) is flattering. i chose this to wear to my husband's christmas office party (his new job)! you know first impressions; i did not want to be over dressed. i wore my antho black boots which lace in back and go over the knee- (slouch a
3417	The wine color is beautiful, and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however, both fabrics are thin, and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so, if you are the quintessential tall and thin, and you don't mind showing your bra, go for it! otherwise, i suggest skipping this one.
3418	I really loved the pattern and style of this dress! unfortunately, i had to return it because i have broad shoulders and it is a pretty stiff top that cut into the flabby area near my armpits. for most people it's probably perfect! but if you have wide shoulders or any concerns about the armpit flab, this might not be a great choice for you.
3419	I saw this dress online and thought it might be an adorable eclectic piece to add to my closet. and was i right. the simple shape mixed with the bold pattern make this dress an awesome one to own. its easy and fun and funky. plus it has hidden pockets! beware though this dress seems to run a bit small. i would say if you switch in between sizes like me i can be a 6 or an 8 then possibly go with the larger size. i do have a large bust as well i wear a 34ddd so it shows some clevage but the girls
3420	I absolutely adore this shirt, it is such a comfortable material and goes great with a pair of jeans! i love how it fits tightly in the sleeves and flows out at the bottom just the right amount. i highly recommend adding this to your wardrobe.
3421	These pants are super funky. the colors have a 70's vibe. retailer do the pants a disservice styling them like the image on the website. they are playfully chic. besides the look, they are super comfy and have a nice stretch. perfect for my job as an art teacher. give them a shot!
3422	This dress is super sweet, but also unique with the reversed fabric on the skirt. it is true to size, unlike a lot of retailer clothes that seem to be boxy/run big. the fabric bunches a little bit at the waist though -- that's my only complaint.
3423	"I am 5'2"", 110 lbs and i ordered my usual size xs and they fit perfectly. they are so soft and comfortable and keep me very warm. i can't wait to take them with me when we go to the snow next month!"
3424	This is a really cute skirt, and it seems well-made (good stitch-work and enough weight to the fabric that i'm not worried about underwear show-through but not too heavy for a summer skirt). i sized up from an 8 to a 10 because it was difficult to get the skirt over my bum. also, the zipper doesn't lay flat when i have it in the back of the skirt so i just shifted it to the side--still looks great imo. i think if you have hips or a booty you might want to size up on this skirt. color is true to
3425	Very cute and comfortable dress. run true to size. i usually wear a 4 and the s fits nicely. stretchy and soft!
3426	This top is so beautiful! whenever i wear it i get lots of compliments. i have washed it a few times on delicate and it still looks great. i do have to wear a cami under it, but the way the straps of the top are made, you cannot see see my bra or cami strap.
3427	"I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4"" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest, but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this, but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though."
3428	Love these jeans. fit great. i've had other colored denim from ag that stretched out too much, were too thin, but these are a nice thicker fabric. i ordered the red and the moss, and the red fit a little better than the moss in the same size. not sure if the dye process affects the fabric but the red pair seemed a bit more substantial. the moss is great too though, so i may keep both.
3429	I normally wear a large but this had no give through the bust! beware big chested girls!!!
3430	I am two months postpartum and bought this top to have something to wear for a date night. it is so flattering and has a beautiful cut. loose but not baggy or unflattering. i bought a small but could have probably sized down... so there's a decent amount of wiggle room in the sizing. great length for jeans or leggings.
3431	Saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on. so lovely! i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person. it's like a muted blue that makes it so versatile. the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering. the safety pin is such a unique touch. it's nice and warm, just not super soft, but not scratchy. i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily.
3432	"This dress has a beautiful fabric, i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering, absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p, i'm 5'5"" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me."
3433	These tights have a nice pattern and color. they look just like the photograph. they are warm and because they are warm they have wool in them and they are a little itchy. but, that's the price you pay for warmth. i own several pairs of retailer tights and love the patterns (foxes, scotty dogs, and now trees). .
3434	So cute! a definite add for this summer. sizing and pattern are both on-point. would be cute with so many bottoms
3435	These pants are a really pretty color and feel nice on. the fit was great and did not really shrink with washing. i received a lot of compliments the first time i wore them.
3436	This top has really beautiful lace detail. the color is much deeper pink than the picture online. i ordered the xs petite and it fits fine but i like my tops longer so i wish i had gotten the regular xs instead. it is very pretty!
3437	I absolutely love this top!! i bought the ivory color, and i am definitely considering buying the black as well! it feels true to size, but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy. i can't wait to wear this top all season long!
3438	Overall: a super comfy dress that you can wear anywhere. short, petite ladies beware though; the dress does not hang at your natural waist like it shows in the model's photos. in order for me to have it sit at my waist, the dress was folded over and did not flatter.
3439	Very cozy lounge tee, but runs large. i ordered a small rather than my usual medium and could of probably went down two sizes.
3440	These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for, and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim, but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse, but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants.
3441	This skirt was cute on, but not particularly flattering. i thought the denim was a little too stiff. typically, a-lines are flattering on my figure, but this was a miss.
3442	"This one is a beauty! my store is not carrying the white - they had a lovely blue (periwinkle-ish) that immediately caught my eye. the ivory model shot makes the details of the lace and top layer really pop - more so than the blue variety but both are stunning. the details and layers on this dress are lovely and intricate without feeling overly delicate. quality most definitely in line with the price.   fit: 130lbs/34c/5'6"" high waist. i'm a 4 or 6 at retailer depending on the brand. in most mou"
3443	I just tried this top on in xs regular even though i generally wear xspetite in retailer and it fit great (34aa - 26 - 34). i think it's flattering on my fairly straight body with the halter neck, fitted waist and peplum. i would guess it would be flattering on many body types; it highlights shoulders beautifully. it was very hard to get my head through the small, not-too-stretchy opening so you may want to try it on without makeup. i knocked off one star because the neck band wasn't symmetrical,
3444	"I bought this top in the brown /white combo although i really wanted the red /white but haven't had any luck finding it. i am never sure of my size in retailer but run anywhere from small to large depending on brands. i'm 5'4"", 140, 34 ddd. i wish other reviewers would state their sizes to help others purchase.. i got this shirt in size 8 which usually never happens to me. i wear a white tank or cream cami underneath since it is very sheer and dips low at the cleavage area. it is still flowy but n"
3445	This dress is the perfect combination of bohemian chic. however, the slip below the dress runs a tad bit small. i have a wide rib cage and normally wear between a 04-06. the dress would have been just perfect if the slip was a bit larger.
3446	The only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big. i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for. i wouldn't say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect. still love it!
3447	What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point, i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead, i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s, made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.
3448	This blouse is so pretty! i love the neck tie which gives it interest and won't look boring on it's own. i'll wear this all-year round. i ordered an xxs which fits perfect.
3449	I now own this shirt in 4 different styles. although i don't expect it to last forever, thus far, they wash really well given how thin they are and light weight. i love the simple cut, and how good they look dressed up or down. it is so hard to find comfy tees, and this one fits the bill! my only wish is that they sold it in solid print colors like white and black. then i would own 6 ;)
3450	"When i was purchasing this i asked to myself ""do i really need another black jacket"". when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket. this jacket is special. it is light weight - but structured. it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing. this jacket is my new favorite."
3451	"Since these are high waist pants, i think the size given is more for a lower waist measurement where most pants these days typically sit. i'm 5'10"", 150 lbs and ordered a size 31 but it was much too large. i love the style of these pants a lot. they look great if you have long legs, the size 31 ran about 5"" above my ankle, higher than is shown in the photos but it looks great."
3452	I love this ankle length pant. it is so comfortable wear it with a tunic or tee. i can wear this for 3 seasons!
3453	"This fabric of this top is gorgeous. however, i'm 5' 5"" and it hits in a really weird spot. right no the point of the hip that you don't want to accentuate. you could wear it with leggings to a casual thing, but i work in an office so its too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans. sad, i love the top 90% of it."
3454	Cute shirt, great for a lazy day off. i got an xs, but i thought this was a bit lose especially around the waist. the shirt is good quality, the material is heavier, great for spring/fall. it goes well with leggings and a jacket.
3455	I am in between sizes (and styles) after having a baby. this dress looks great on my curvy figure and enhances my look with the cinching of the belt and the detail of the flutter sleeves. perfect length and really fits well. i am very happy with it!
3456	This is a great tee. true to size, i ordered the large and it skims nicely over my hips. it has lovely quirky design features in the back and pinkish cross stitches on the sleeves and shoulders. i got the blue and it looks just like the pic. great weight for the rest of summer into fall. perfect addition to my casual life style.
3457	This sweater looks great with chambray colored denim. i wear it with jeans, shift dresses and even leggings. definitely one of my go to sweaters for the fall.
3458	This blouse is very beautiful and flattering. it's just a little bit see through so i will wear a cami underneath. as with sizing i did size up as the other commenters recommended to do so.
3459	This is going to be perfect for my daughter's graduation. she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her!
3460	I was really lucky to pick up these shorts during the tag sale, and they are great! lightweight, roomy in the legs (way more my speed, i prefer shorts that don't cling) and really soft. they also weren't too short. i am usually between two sizes at retailer, depending on the brand, and ended up going with the smaller size. they're not really a size too big, but would've been a little too roomy/baggy in the waist, had i not purchased the smaller.
3461	"I bought this dress for a trip to the caribbean and really enjoyed wearing it. i was worried it might look like a ""sack"" but i think it is both slimming and flattering. i love the interesting neckline and rolled up sleeves!! a winner."
3462	I loved the look of this blouse online. i really wanted a cute eyelet top for summer. the blouse looked great out of the package but the fit was not good. i am a 00p and 32 b bra size, this top was too tight across my chest but billowed out in the back. its as if the armholes were too far forward. it is fairly short but i am short waisted. i really wanted this top to work but i had to return it. if i went up one size the back of the blouse would have been ridiculously large and the top was too e
3463	Perfect denim top! the fabric/material is great and of good quality. there is a structure to the top, but it really makes the looks. the quality is amazing and the top can be styled in so many ways. for the quality, a definite must buy!
3464	I wish they would have shown this belted as it is beyond striking if you slip you belt thru the top of the slit.under the fabric and bring thru the front belting only the front leaving the back full...stunning and chic! because of the colors this will be incredible in the fall...i plan to wear with all my on trend overalls and booties...madly in love with it. i am certain if all these 1 star reviwes played with it in the fashion they too would have given 5 stars. the knit is beautiful and again
3465	"I really loved this top the minute i put it on. read the other reviews but it really worked for me. i am 5'3"", 36dd, athletic build and the m fit perfectly with a nice roomy fit. top will be perfect for my upcoming trip to tahoe. plan to wear with light denim, dark denim, and black cropped denim bottoms. even looks great with a culottes or denim skirt. the weight is really nice and it washed nicely. i washed on delicate, and laid flat to dry. a little pressing and good as new. it has a nice boze"
3466	This blouse is made out of a high-quality material, flows beautifully, and the neutral flower pattern makes its yellow/green base pop. i played with a bow and decided that it looks the best tied lower than on the model to form v shaped neckline. this piece will transition easily from one season to the next and from causal to dressy. for the reference, size 12 was the best fit form my curvy 36dd frame.
3467	I love this dress!! it has a beautiful european flair, and more beautiful in person. i don't agree with the other reviewers that its see through-the fabric is a good quality, and thicker than you would think. the variable length is the best part of the dress. the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow!
3468	Great skirt, easy to wear. perfect weight for spring/fall. very comfortable while still looking stylish. the xs fit well.
3469	This jumper is adorable and very well made! it is a bit tight in the ankles and it kind of gives me a hungry bum look but then i realized i ordered a 4p so it is actually tts. going to preview this number at my bachelorette party!
3470	I just bought the grey, and now i'm coming back for the black and cream i lovethis staple item!! so soft fits great!
3471	I&#39;m 5&#39;3&quot; 118 lbs and the 26 navy fit great.  the gray i can hardly button and are less flattering.  i will order another size 26 in gray to see if it will fit better, but also try a 27.
3472	The sweater is light and very soft. the silver banding on the neck, sleeves and hem make it easy to dress up.
3473	I am so happy i ordered this jumpsuit. it is exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. the fabric is light and it's very well made. great length for dressing up with heals or dressing down with flats. i love it!
3474	"I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on. it doesn't look nearly as good on the hanger, so definitely worth trying on. the fabric is high quality and super comfy; the fit is very flattering. i am curvy, 5'7"" and got the navy stripe print in size small. it's very forgiving, fitted without clinging to any ""problem"" areas. i also love how versatile it is--you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models, or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings. love it!"
3475	"This dress is very small in the bust and maxi length on short people (5'3"" 36dd). i can't wear a normal bra, i have to use adhesive pasties. the fabric is very smooth, thick and satin like, but fuzzes easily. mine came with minor thread pulls and one strap was sewn on twisted. the pattern in real life is very pink as opposed to the model sample which has more blue landscape. i'd like to hem the dress but i would sacrifice pattern. still very pretty dress. be sure to size up one or two depending"
3476	I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.
3477	I purchased this on sale, xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater, but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy, but i would say itchy and cozy!
3478	If you're on the fence about this dress - go for it! i am a huge retailer shopper but haven't ever been compelled to write a review until now.  this dress fits beautifully.  the materials is so soft and comfortable and the design of the dress is very flattering, with or without a belt.  i am 5'2, 118 pounds and i purchased the pxs. it's perfect!  i wore this with booties and received a ton of compliments. the fringe and hemline make this dress really stand out.
3479	I wanted to like this so much. it's a great good girl dress, church dress. however, it makes no sense. it's a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags i'm petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide.
3480	This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front, and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.
3481	I purchased the violet chino's in my local store. the color to me is more plum than violet but a nice shade still. the fit was perfect and they are oh so comfortable. i bought size 27 (weight fluxes 116-118). i can see having several pairs of these in other colors because of the comfort level and they work for fall, spring and summer. in the warmer states even winter. the fabric has a soft feel to it.
3482	"My new favorite cozy and stylish ""go-to"" piece for everything from park with the kiddos to mat class to impromptu financial meetings."
3483	I absolutely love this top. i'm always either an x-small or 0/2 in mauve. i think this top runs small. i tried on an extra small and it was too tight in the chest. i'm average in bust.
3484	"The overall color of this dress is more buttery white and the pale golden embroidery almost blends in.therefore i think the dress benefits from being styled . i tried bold colored scarves with fringes and big statement jewelry. this dress is more casual with its fringes , the jeans like material ( although softer than cotton) as well as the loose pullover style. it is easy to dress down with a blue jean jacket, casual sandals or even sneakers.  i have a 38 c chest and the l fits almost too loos"
