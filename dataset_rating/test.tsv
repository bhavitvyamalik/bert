3000	"This top is soo pretty with a cool edge. it looks and feels like really good quality."
3001	"This top is everything it promises to be. i read other reviews and purchased a small (i'm typically between an x-small/small depending on the day of the week) and was glad i did. a medium would definitely have been too big but the small fit perfectly. i have a shorter torso (5'3""/117 pounds) so i didn't experience any apprehension about my stomach showing. i paired it with a pair of skinny black ankle pants and a pair of navy and grey d'orsay heels. it worked wonderful and i can't wait to pair i"
3002	I absolutely love everything about this top! i bought it in the taupe/navy stripes version and got compliments the first time i wore it. i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all, but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer. the neckline and sleeves seem tailor-fitted for my body. i don't often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect length/shape to be incredibly flattering. they're in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regular-length. the neckline is eq
3003	So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it, i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing, the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i'm a 36 dd and mostly a size l, so that's what i ordered. it wasn't snug, but it didn't have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look, so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too, but i could have rolle
3004	I look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size. for some reason, this fabric isn't working for me. i think it's the sheed combined with the stretch (or lack there of) of the fabric. i'll have to pass.
3005	"Cute top! the bright red crochet shoulders and back add the perfect pop of color to the light blue pinstriped front. it's a little loose and boxy around the bust area but overall i think it's a flattering shape. i got the regular s and don't find it too short. for reference i'm 5'2"", 134 lb, 34b. i often wear petite sizes but due to other reviews mentioning that the top is short i ordered the regular size and am happy with the length and fit."
3006	I wanted to like this top, especially because of its comfortable material and color, but the asymmetrical shape didn't hang well on me. it also runs big - i got a small, and although the bodice fit okay, the sleeves were long, and the bottom of the top looked mishaped and dumpy. this top will be going back.
3007	"This top hit at my hips not as it appears on the model in the photo, and i am short at 5' 2"". cute top, but shorter than i had expected and definitely not a tunic style."
3008	I purchased this vest in the store. the colors vary depending on where it is sewn - i purchased one with black around the middle, and more black around the collar (it was more flattering). the fit and design are lovely. it's fuzzy, but since i don't have any 'fur' in my wardrobe, this is a nice ease into that part of fashion for me. i highly recommend it, even for the price.
3009	This is the most comfortable, sweet, beautiful, romantic and timeless dress. i bought the green motif one is sz 14 and it fits perfectly. i am smaller chested (usually a 12/medium/large up top depending on the item) and a sz 14/xl/33 for pants so perhaps this dress runs one size small? the color in the detail shot is most accurate - it's bright & cheerful and dreamy.
3010	I love the beautiful flowy material and design. definitely runs a bit large. i ordered an xs and it needs to be taken in as well as taken up. i would have ordered the petite if it wasn't out of stock, so the length is probably fine for most. shimmery detail is beautiful.
3011	I love this t-shirt, i wish it came in tons of other prints! very soft, almost feels lived in, and high quality all the same.
3012	"This bathing suit has everything. i especially love the ruching in the waist and the boy short bottom. finally the coverage my booty needs. i've worn it dozens of times and it still holds its quality and looks brand new. i get a lot of compliments every time i wear it. the only drawback is it doesn't dry very quickly. after a dip in the pool or the lake it stays wet for hours even when i'm laying out in the summer heat."
3013	This sweater is so much cuter in person than as pictured. i bought the lovely red one today. i got my usual size, xs. i plan to wear it more fitted as a top rather than as a jacket, although i can still layer it if i want. the color is divine. the weight is just right, not too heavy but not too light. sometimes peplums overwhelm me, but this one did not. it hits at just the right spots and is flattering all over, particularly making my waist look small.
3014	Love this tee! the fit is true to size, and very flattering shaping. not too tight, not too baggy, good length. i love the stitching detail on the top. the material is thick enough that you are not forced to wear a cami under it. my only concern is that it says to hand wash, dry clean acceptable. i have had some bad luck with retailer tops shrinking. i'm not going to risk it and dry clean it. normally i would not want that expense or hassle.
3015	I have a curvy figure, and this top is not for me. it fits loose at the top and is tight at the bottom. it is also short. i think this top works best on slender figures.
3016	It was huge. material looked good but was too bulky. will be returning it.
3017	Sized up due to my 36ddd breastfeeding bust and the 14 for perfectly.  i am 5'6 and 165lbs, just fyi.  dress is super flattering on my post 4-baby body.  it's very slimming.  looking forward to wearing to a casual wedding,
3018	I came to retailer just to browse and came across this dress. i almost didn't get it because it looked very big. however, i tried it on, and fell in love with it. it does run a little wide, but the length is good, and it is very comfortable. it is perfect for the summer months.
3019	Great dress - fits tts (i am a 6p and purchased a sp). looks good with boots or ballet flats.
3020	"I love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended. not so. for starters the top is much more of a beige in person. a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully. secondly there is just so. much. fabric. it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like i've tried to hard to make it ""work"", lastly the"
3021	This is one of the best things i have ever bought from anrtho. it is very flattering, and i always get compliments when i wear it. must have!
3022	Love this top!  it is fitted through the shoulders and arms and has a slight swing.  the peplum falls at a great spot and the material lays nicely.  very flattering on my 5 months postpartum body that is on the rebound.  i got the blue but i might get the pink too!
3023	The fabric is beautiful, the embroidery quite striking, and the length is perfect. however, the dress is a bit amorphous; and as others have mentioned, the sleeves are silly. so i took the dress to my favorite seamstress, and she added a couple of darts in the back and fixed the sleeves - voila!. these weren't expensive fixes, and now the dress is perfect.
3024	I bought this in-store and it is much nicer than it appears in the photos online. the fabric is soft and drapey, making the top lightweight and flowy. this is not a fitted shirt, and i didn't feel it was overly large, so i think it runs true to size. i felt fine in an xs. t did feel the need to wear a camisole/ tank with it, but i tend towards the modest side. i bought it with the wide-legged linen pants and have worn it with wedge sandals with many compliments! i wish i'd noticed the navy blue
3025	I love this tunic! the fit is ttt and the quality is nice. i will get much use out of this piece!
3026	"This is a beautiful blouse but needs to be returned for size. i have lost a bit of weight; the last couple of blouses i have gotten in a m (including this one) have been to large for me. i am 5'5"" tall, 138 lbs and in this blouse need a s. the fabric is satiny and substantial with a gorgeous lining edged in contrasting thread., it hits at the top of my thigh in a regular size 8 but i should have ordered a 6. i would say to size down if you are close to being between sizes. the colors are as show"
3027	I could live in these. they are so comfy. i typically wear a 6 and got the medium. they are a little roomy. probably could have gotten a small..but i like them kinda loose and baggy. i will probably purchase another color!
3028	Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like i'm pregnant (not that there's anything wrong with that) very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf.
3029	This is by far one of my favorite dresses i have tried on in a long time. i am a 2-4, the small was tts and so flattering. i think this would be better for someone taller with a lean frame, though its not super tight and the material has a great weight to it, it isn't lined and could definitely show figure flaws. for me it skims my body elegantly and was very comfortable through the bust, waist and hip (34c/26/36). it fits me like the model in the image. the one down side is that it is pullover
3030	I was immediately drawn to this stunning blouse ( in pink) in the store. it is a fabulous silk and velvet just in time for the holidays and beyond. in true floreat style it is well made and unique.  i'd say it fits tts to maybe slightly small if you want it to fit like it does on the model. i usually buy petite sizes when available but went with regular sizing as that is what was in the store and i liked the fit.
3031	"I tried this tunic at a store and loved it. i had to buy a much bigger size because the sleeves are so narrow. the 12 fit ok but the sleeves are so tight it hurt. i have normal arms and i am so glad i was at a store to try a bigger size."
3032	First saw this jacket in the catalog, in peach, and had to have it. i received it today, and love it. its a soft, muted peach, very neutral. i ordered xl, im usually a m-l, but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy. the quality is great, feels good on. love it so much, i just ordered it in the dark grey. very classic jacket, will wear for years. one of my favorite hei hei pieces, never disappoints.
3033	I have received so many compliments. it's my favorite
3034	The print was what attracted me to this dress. and the material is soft and comfortable. however, the fit was all wrong for me. it had a great belt in the back, but hung very loosely in the front. it reminded me a little of some of my maternity dresses. maybe sizing down would have helped, but then i feared it wouldn't fit my hips right. this dress may look better on someone who isn't as curvy. it really looks great on the model, but not on me.
3035	Love the dress. i usually wear a small and will be exchanging it for an x-small.
3036	"I ordered the sapphire.............it is simply beautiful! love love love. superior hunter style and quality which never disappoints!"
3037	There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect, the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening, and the cut (length, wide straps, and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure, skin color, and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...
3038	"This is as pretty in person as it is online, good quality (except one item i'll get to), and fits true to size. i'm 5'6"", normally a medium/8, and the medium fit great in this top. i almost kept this shirt...so close, i had it on a hanger, but i kept trying it on. the shirt is well displayed in the pics online, but unless you get close it's hard to see that the top button is set a little wide. every time i put it on, my eyes went to the top button (i did get a second opinion and they agreed)..."
3039	I did not have to size up or down because of my body type (broad padded back, wide rib cage, narrow hips, small bum.) however, it fits a little odd on me. the back darts that start at the waist and are supposed to curve for your behind settle too high and wrinkle. the waist is also too high. the shoulders are a bit tight. i am confused because i bought the exact same size pieced brocade (the colorful version of this dress) and that one actually fits spot on. i have a feeling if i go to the store
3040	"Love the pattern play on this skirt! i had to size up to a 6 (i usually take a 2 or 4 in skirts) as it was too snug in the hips/waist. going up a size worked well and the hem hit me at the knee (i'm 5' 6""). thought it looked cute with the cloth & stone chambray tank :)"
3041	I love the bright floral print flanking the solid white middle in this top. with its swing style and large arm holes i think i could have sized down and been ok, but i usually wear a cami with my tanks so the arm holes are not an issue. also, it has a touch of spandex in it which make it extra comfy. overall, a darling top!
3042	I wanted to love it - the color is great, the embroidery pretty, but the stiff scalloped sleeves were just too much. if you have broad shoulders this is not the shirt for you. i think personally it would have been better had the material been softer.
3043	I really love this pant. ordered online and they fit well. they're cute, edgy with the fray at the bottom. corduroy material. awesome!
3044	The fabric is really gorgeous, and the lining is lovely and soft. unfortunately being on the petite (short) side, it just didn't look quite right on me. i felt a little swallowed up. i wish it had worked because it's so lovely!!
3045	I wish they would have shown this belted as it is beyond striking if you slip you belt thru the top of the slit.under the fabric and bring thru the front belting only the front leaving the back full...stunning and chic! because of the colors this will be incredible in the fall...i plan to wear with all my on trend overalls and booties...madly in love with it. i am certain if all these 1 star reviwes played with it in the fashion they too would have given 5 stars. the knit is beautiful and again
3046	I loved this dress when i tried it on. the plaid is darling and the plunge is sexy. i so wish it would work for my body type. the waist came a bit too high on me (almost a line) and it made me look kind of frumpy in the midline.
3047	One word: obsessed. feel like a carrie bradshaw bohemian queen. sturdy and luxurious, pretty fancy, definitely queen-worthy. i&amp;amp;#39;m walzing around my house in this dress listening to john mayer and feeling fab
3048	This is a really great top. it looks fantastic on. while it is a bigger fit, its so flattering. i get tons of compliments every time i wear it.
3049	"I think these jeans are good for people with long lean legs. i'm 5'7"" 155 lbs and the wide cuff made my legs look short and stubby. the weight of the jeans is a little on the heavier side - i usually like soft denim. i usually wear a 31 and thought they were true to size."
3050	I ordered my usual size; however when it arrived it appeared to fit a 9 year old! the color and style are adorable. i will need to exchange it for 2 sizes larger! i am so shocked at maeve's sizing.
3051	This is a cute top, especially the material design. i like tops that go over my bottom and this does. if i had a problem it is with the sizing. the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get. some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size. i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big. but i still love the overall look. i am also petite which is what i ordered.
3052	So glad i was able to snag these killer 70's-ish flares. they are super cool at a nice length. love the button detail. i ordered these in my current size and they fit right out of the box. love them so much.
3053	As the other reviewers stated, it does run large, i sized down 1 size and it's perfect. great dress to wear so many ways.
3054	"This is a great dress - nice soft fabric and the red is a nice, vibrant tomato red color.  i ordered a small - i am 5'4"" and usually wear a 4 in dressed.  this dress was so huge - it might be mismarked but labeled a small.  i will have to return it - not even my seamstress can make it fit!"
3055	I ordered a regular size 6 because the petite size 6 was sold out. it was too large for me; maybe the 4 would have worked. in part because the size was off, it looked frumpy on me with the poofs and flowers. however, i did like that it is cotton and has its own beige-colored slip that snaps on at the shoulders. i have no doubt this could look very nice on someone if the size was just right.. i like the black crochet-type details.
3056	Cute, but didnt realize it was sweatshirt material. due to that, returning.
3057	Love, love, love this piece! very flowy, but made of good material. glad i purchased this item!
3058	This is a beautiful dress. the detail is amazing, but it runs a little small. i'm usually size 0, but i had to go up a size in this dress. its cut a little too tight, and there is no give in the fabric. otherwise its stunning!
3059	Oh this is so much prettier in person! what you can't see from the pics is that the bottom flutes out a bit. it is quite charming. fits true to size.
3060	"I?m not the type of woman that wears dresses, but oh man...this dress! i?ve been eyeing it for a while, and it finally went on sale, then the extra 30% off made me cave. got it for $115. i bought it one size smaller (8) to encourage me to not over-indulge this xmas, and if fit like a glove. for reference, i?m 36 bust, 30 waist and normally a size 10 in retailer. it accentuates your curves & hugs your body while being ""sexy/conservative"". the intricate embroidery is exquisite and very eye catching."
3061	I love designs that are flowy/drapey in the front, so this hits the mark when tied in the back. has lots of visual interest. but i agree with the other reviewers.. the slip is super small. dress fits true to size, if not a bit large but the slip is one full size smaller. and you must wear a slip. overall, i'm pleased with the look.
3062	I am 5.1 and 113lbs. i ordered the petite size 26 and it fits like a glove. i gave 4 starts as i wish i had less stretch in it but other than that they are perfect length and sooo soft. super happy with the cut and waist height!
3063	I ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening. after seeing the other reviews i wasn't sure about it, but i was very pleased when it arrived. i find it is elegant and sexy, but also modest enough when i sized up by 1. i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly. it is form-fitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight. i'm excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace.
3064	"I am very happy about the jacket. i like the material and the cut. i was able to wear the jacket for a walk on a rather windy day, about 60 f, with a thin sweater underneath, and it felt comfortable.   the fit is very flattering. i would prefer the sleeves to be a little longer (5'7"", 125 lb, got size s). also, i wish the lining was full, not just the front detail - it would allow more versatility. but that's just me...  overall, i like it :))"
3065	This coat is truly gorgeous in person. it's an investment coat, one that i will probably wear for years to come because the style is timeless and the color is lovely. i found it to be very high quality. in fact, i would love to see more coats of this caliber from retailer. the other reviews had me hesitant to splurge on it, but i don't plan on wearing it buttoned very often so that will be a non-issue for me. the lining is one of the best parts of the coat! show it off! i think the problem
3066	These pants are lovely and comfortable, but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them, they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric, and thought i'd give it a try, but i didn't think it would be this bad. for the price, i expect better quality. also, they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low, it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher, closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6, 28/29 in b
3067	Cute print got lots of compliments when i wore it. lightweight. looks great with boots
3068	I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer, which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however, the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also, the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit, but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).
3069	The length on these are great. they stretch but so far they don't stretch out. the material is a dark and soft. i am 5'6' and 135lbs. the size 26 fit great.
3070	"I wore this dress for the first time yesterday... i have never received so many compliments on a dress before! several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was! it is an absolute must-have!"
3071	I tried this on when i saw it hanging in the dressing room. i was pleasantly surprised by this piece. the color is beautiful - not too yellow - not too brown. i have not worn it yet so i'm assuming it will hold up pretty well considering my other pieces from this designer are still looking good with several wears. i bought this in a small size so it does not hang down like it does on the model. perhaps that's why i don't need a cami underneath.
3072	I really like this top, the material is thicker than i thought which is a good thing! it fits me very well and is very comfortable. i definitely recommend this shirt!
3073	This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews, but it was way too big. sadly, i had to return it.
3074	These shorts are divine. the fabric is sturdy and there is a weave of sparkle that i did not perceive from the picture.
3075	This is my favorite top! it is gorgeous, soft, & oh so comfortable. it's not too tight & works with leggings, jeans, or as an over-shirt. love it!
3076	It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
3077	I was so excited about this top, and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely, but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated, and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.
3078	Wore it to an interview. the color is fantastic. it's beautiful and artsy. highly recommend!
3079	"I ordered this piece online and returned it at the store a few days after arrival. the material is very soft and well made. however it is not flattering on the hourglass or pear shaped person. moreover, if you are short, the design may make you look shorter. i am 5'4"" and it did to me. the design is beautiful. if you are tall and have narrow hips, this is the piece for you. i am 5'4"", 160lbs and usually wear a s/m."
3080	The sweater is comfortable and has a little 70s fabric flair...not quite as classically modern as it looks on the model. i am keeping it because it is a true fall/spring item. not a fabric weight for summer wear in california. the peach color is pretty muted, so it is not a show-stopping going-out piece.
3081	This is online exclusive so i ordered both sizes xs and s. it runs pretty large so i kept size xs. the material can be stretched. but i like the feeling of it and very comfortable to your skin. i am so happy receiving so many compliments wherever i go!!!
3082	I have many left of center tees, and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color), which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long, the cotton is thick, and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite 5 stars for me, though, because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me, though.
3083	The color is great. the fit is accurate and it is a great transitional piece.
3084	I love the style, but it didn't work for me. i ordered the r size. they were way too too long. i generally wear size 26, and the r length works with most retailer pants. with this particular pant, i could barely pull up the zipper. i'm not sure what happened bc i haven't gained any additional weight. i am 5'2, and 110 lbs. unfortunately, i had to return the pants. i think the design is for supermodels. maybe a petite size would have worked? the p was out of stock. good luck!
3085	I wanted to love this. it is so cute and the xxsp, my usual size, fit perfectly. however there was a fatal flaw in the construction. the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided. instead of a scoop like shown on the model, it was much longer on one side than the other. i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me, but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong. this is going back. i ordered another one (now it's on backorder), hopefully
3086	"Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint. i ordered a xxs in black, and it was perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs. it definitely has a lot of volume to it, but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer, so you can ""see"" through it to your thinner figure underneath. it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it, which makes it flattering. another reviewer mentioned the beading turning. i have not seen that on mine, but now i will be looking for i"
3087	This is a beautiful skirt. i'm very pleased with the quality. it runs small though, i'm usually size small and went for the medium. i'm 5' 2 and got the regular vs petit, which would have been too short for me to wear at work.
3088	I ordered this in two sizes and have only received one so far, but i think i really like it. that said, the one i got weirdly has pockets not shown in the images, which makes it seems more professorial than i'd prefer, partly because i am a professor and don't want to dress like one if i can help it. that said, i really need a floppy, easy cardigan, and this might well be it.
3089	Very cozy lounge tee, but runs large. i ordered a small rather than my usual medium and could of probably went down two sizes.
3090	I can understand the concerns of another reviewer about shrinkage. i have a few retailer tops made of similar fabric and they have shrunk a bit. this too fits very well, but once i wash it, it will likely get a bit smaller. i ordered a small, but plan to size up to a medium. for ref. 32ddd bust, and the small fit perfectly with a camo underneath...the shoulders seem to be cut small. so if you are busty like me, size up.
3091	This dress is absolutely beautiful. i was hesitant to purchase it due to the price, but i just couldn't resist. it's so flowy and comfortable. it's quite long on me; i'm 5'5 and have to wear heels so that it doesn't drag, but could easily be fixed with alerations. i wore this to a wedding and received so many compliments.
3092	"Really cute dress for work. fits exactly as i expected. this dress is very comfortable and looks put together on days when you're being lazy and just want to ""throw something on""."
3093	These tights are comfortable and the material is great. i bought the gray and holly color and the colors are as shown online. similar to most nylon tights they snag easily. definitely not a legging and similar to other reviewers these won't keep you warm in the winter.
3094	I really wasn't sure if this dress would work for me, so i was very excited when i fell in love with it! i haven't experienced any quality or tearing issues with it as one reviewer noted, thank goodness! i love the color scheme and versatility of this dress. i have worn it with tights, a belt and short-heeled ankle booties to make it a little more dressy. but i most love it with some funky jewelry and leggings, wearing it more tunic style. the slip underneath is a great feature as well! it does
3095	I love this cotton weave shift dress. it is supposed to be loose and not tight. i purchased a medium and fits the way i see it should fit. ref: 34dd, 148 lb; 5'4 height. hits above the knee but office appropriate as not too short. i paired it with a few seasons ago, the navy blue suede fringe jacket by retailer elevenses; new necklace in the blue motif from retailer ( it has a hanging druzy pendant) navy hose and navy crew neck long sleeve top.  great outfit for work and an after work party at retailer
3096	I was so excited for this dress to come. i am 5&#39;1&quot; and 100lbs so i ordered and xs petite. it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around. maybe on someone taller this would have looked great. i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate. my dress was a much lighter blue. back to the store it goes.
3097	Bells out to much i had to send it back
3098	"Oh my god - i love this skirt. i first order the size 4 and immediately called customer service and had them send me a 2. i found it be be both plenty stretchy (great for moving, sitting, etc) but runs on the large size. but the fit is amazing. i love the length - a perfect knee-skimmer for me (5'9""). i love the color (green) and the pockets and button fly are so fun without being too much! i've tried it on with several tops and sweaters in my closet and this skirt is going to be one that i can"
3099	Three tops for the price of one.....i fell in love with this top the moment i saw it online. i tried it on as soon as i received it with jeans and it looked just how i hoped it would. not too short, just right. then i tried it on with the buttons in front and just loved how it looked. this can be worn 3 ways......back buttoned, front buttoned and as an unbuttoned throw on over a tank and shorts. recommend this highly for just about any body type..
3100	I was so bummed when this came in...the colors and print are beautiful, but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic/ruffle combo. there is also a liner which is a nice touch, but it's significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts. definitely going back.
3101	This vest is much silkier than the pictures online show, which was a great surprise. the cut of this vest is beautiful and it can be worn so many ways!
3102	Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere, it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said, you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.
3103	Comfortable and cute. versatile colors that can be worn with virtually anything.
3104	I love it. perfect, body hugging, just right length and great fabric colors. this shift fits just above knee and follows every curve. it is, however, unforgiving-there is no room in this to cover bumps or bulges; it is sleek and so figure-flattering. i am 140 lbs, 5'5 tall and 34d and it fits perfectly. one more pound and it wouldn't have zipped! i got a size 6 (my usual)!but too tight had to size up to 8. if you are on the fence, go up a size. i can't, however, imagine wearing this sleeveless a
3105	"These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter, but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight, but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back!   for reference ( if you decide to try your luck), i am 5'7"", 128# and my normal size s was perfect."
3106	"I loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives. the grey color is drab, yet leaves room for creativity. it's stylish yet wrinkles horribly. i am 5' 2"" so it hangs too low in the front and armpits. another reviewer mentioned the buttons, yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest. the pockets are a great space for hands, yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits, so will not hold much. i typically wear a 4 petite and the small fits"
3107	I am a true to size 4 and when this bathing suit arrived it looks like it's a kids 4. i will exchange for an 8 and hope for the best. the quality looks great and the styling is beautiful but i could barely get into the suit.
3108	I love the off the shoulder tee so much that i ordered two of them in different colors. i can wear them with jeans or i can wear them with gym attire while out running errands and still feel like i look nice!
3109	These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy, sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great.
3110	This top is gorgeous! it's a nice weight and the cami that comes with it makes it drapes nicely. i'll have to send it back though because it's too big. i'm always a medium but in this i'll be a small. :(
3111	"Loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape.  looks great on. the tie in front adds to the dress.   i love to wear with tan knee-high boots."
3112	"I saw this shirt online, loved it, but unfortunately it was sold out in the regular size small. however, retailer shirts tend to be long on me, so i ordered a petite small. it fits great! i am actually happy i got a petite because i feel a regular would have been too long. the shirt comes to my hips. for reference i'm 5'8"" 145 lbs. and my measurements are 34-27-38."
3113	The print is awesome !
3114	This dress by dolan is my go to favorite for work. it gives a polished look with a pair of booties.i purchased it in an xs. i'm 5'1 and c-d cup. fit me perfectly. i can't wait to team it up with a sweater for chillier fall days. you will get a ton of compliments with this dress. love, love , love.
3115	These ran very small compared to other charlie pants i've bought in the past. even sizing up, the stripes were not flattering. the lady in the next dressing room over tried them on, too, and had the same feeling i did. the less curvy you are, the better stripes look. they more curvy you are, the less flattering stripes on pants look. the way the stripes come together at the seams just isn't flattering.
3116	A mango beauty that resonates the color of blossoms in bloom. comfortable, effortless, and charming. i wear a size small in retailer dresses and this one fit true to size for me. tried the xs since reviews mentioned it ran large, but too tight across my average chest. looks great with denim jacket and red suede strappy sandals. also worn with a belt to accentuate waist.
3117	I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight, it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said, i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to, where i lo
3118	This dress looks so plain on this model you'd never guess it looks so adorable on. i saw it as i walked into my local retailer and tried it on quickly over skinny jeans i was wearing with grey suede boots and it looked amazing! it's a perfect teacher dress. wear it over tights or jeans during colder weather, chunky sandals during warmer weather. it has side pockets i absolutely love. you must try it on to believe it. the fabric is soft and of great quality.
3119	I got this when it went on sale (in navy and coral colors), awesome dress for any occasion! as far as complaints go about the straps, its meant to be low-cut! i really like the basket weave bodice although that does make it more difficult to zip up, but i found it was easier to just slip the dress on zipped up since the stretchy fabric gives quite a bit rather than deal with the zipper. i normally wear about a 0-2 in most retailer brands and have the dress in both sizes (didn't notice a big differ
3120	Oh i simply can't say enough about this dress... it's just so pretty! i've sometimes had trouble with beaded pieces from retailer but not this dress. it's a very flattering piece and the material is comfortable and soft. really flattering. you can dress it up or down as well - i'm glad i'll be able to wear this into fall with a leather jacket.
3121	This top is adorable; fits like a glove which makes me a little nervous...there were no washing instructions attached so i will hope for the best. the quality of your garments are always excellent; its only the risk of buying on line (sizing) which makes me hold my breath until i can try my order on. it is a joy to get items that fit from retailer, my favorite online store!
3122	"The blouse is lovely - i loved the lace, color (though just as other reviewers mentioned its a darker blue closer to a teal color) and edging. i am very petite, for reference, 5'2"", 24 waist and 30e and normally wear a 00 or 00p. the 00 was still too wide for me around the waist/bottom and had too much of a swingy effect - it made me look like i was pregnant so i sadly returned. i wish this had more of a fitted look to it."
3123	This unit is gorgeous as a dress or as a top with a cami, skinny jeans and boots. i'm wearing it to my cousins wedding and obsessed. i bought a long delicate necklace at retailer with a gold pendant and it falls perfectly with the neckline. my only slightly negative comment is about the quality. the material is beautiful but i noticed the elastic coming through the ends of the waistband where it snaps shut. still keeping it though!
3124	"When i unwrapped this a chemical ""stink"" hit me that amost knocked me over. it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells. second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut. the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner. i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here. with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out. i do not recommend this fo"
3125	Such a beautiful pattern - i think you could wear it with a skirt and it wouldn't even read as a bathing suit. love the lacy pattern in front. great fit. i bought a medium, when i usually wear a small in retailer. it fits a little loose, so i'd probably buy a small if i bought another one, but it all depends on how you like your suits to fit.
3126	This top is cute. i purchased a 2 instead of my usual size 4 and it fits well. i only recommend buying this top on sale. it is not good quality! there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through. it is totally nuts that it costs $88.
3127	I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with. my recent preference has been for high-rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash. when i tried these on in my normal size, they were so cute that i bought them full-priced. i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy (which is what makes them soft and comfortable), but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours. by th
3128	"Runs true to size but some details were not as expected. the slit is only on one side and the look is more like sweater dress than sweater tunic. the length is not as long as pictured on the model. i'm 5'7 and the sweater ends half an inch below knees. the side slit starts too high, my waist is exposed unless i wear high waisted leggings. other than that the sweater is darling. the cotton (68%) and acrylic (32%) thread is soft and thin, not bulky at all. the sweater stretches lightly with wear a"
3129	Easy to wear and very cute, especially for curvy ladies. but, i think it looks best worn with a best, or a blazer on top, something to emphasize the waist a bit more.
3130	This top is beautiful and i really wanted to be able to keep it - i've tried it on 3 times. it is not for big-chested girls (34ddd) - it hangs like i'm 20 months pregnant because the top area lands on top of my chest. sadly this will be going back. it is beautiful and flowing and a perfect weight.
3131	I could seriously sleep in this--it's that soft! i dressed this with a white tee and holey jeans then i wore it to work today over a blue midi dress. love this jacket!!!
3132	"I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it! the fabric is a great weight- flowy, but still substantial enough. with nude undergarments, i can't see anything. in fact, that is one of the things i love; no special undergarments are required, so it is very comfortable and still very flattering. i typically wear a medium- 135 pounds, 5'4"", 34b, 28 waist, 40 hip. i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big. i would have bought it, but the salesperson suggested i try"
3133	Great, special cardigan. fits like a shrug and a little short but is perfect over a tight fitting sheath. great for broad shoulders.
3134	"This is made of soft, sweatshirt material. it is one of those dresses that you can put on with sandals or birkinstocks and go out to breakfast or throw it on to go to the beach or wear after yoga. this is not a ""dressy"" dress. that said, i love it. i used to have a sweatshirt dress from another brand that i wore out and have been searching for the replacement. this color is a pale celadon, a tad bit more vibrant than the photo, which makes it more flattering than you may think. i wear a 4-6 and"
3135	I had high hopes for this coat, but it was a miss for me. while the wool is soft and not itchy, the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy.  also, the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located.  i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was, but alas, i just could not get over the poor tailoring.  for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs) and it was big.
3136	"This is such a lovely piece. i usually wear a medium in moth. i am 135 pounds and 5'4"". the quality is exceptional. i highly recommend this sweater coat."
3137	I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5'6 120 and usually a s fits. however, this was really tight. also, the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one.
3138	I saw this dress in the store window and gave it a try. i found it to be super flattering and feminine. the bodice is form fitting and the skirt flares out to a full skirt. the colors are fun and vibrant. the neckline is a bit low for work but perfect for evening. it is true to size.
3139	I ordered a small and i'm usually always a small. i could not zip it up. i'm am returning it for a large, and this is concerning because what if it is big in a weird way because i'm usually a large?
3140	"These pants fit me perfectly..i am 5'7"" and 134 (most days).. and wore a 4..they are so comfortable, i could sleep in them. they do stretch a little after wearing (linen), which can be a good thing to some...they are a heavier linen so good for mild winters..almost look denim..if they came in more colors i would get more!they also remind me of my old hippie days, which was fun"
3141	"I opened the package and loved this skirt immediately. i held it up and the waist is tiny. i'm usually a size 6 but sometimes go for a size 8 at retailer (i'm 5'6"" and 126 lbs). i would have needed at least 4 extra inches in the waist band to close the zipper...i wonder if this is a british size 8 or something. this 8 is closer to a 4. really disappointed."
3142	I was eyeing this blouse when the catelog was mailed to me earlier this year. i never got a chance to try it on in stores, but when i saw it online and on sale i snagged it. what i didn't realize was the intricate design of this blouse. ithas really pretty lace all over the top and then fine beading securely sewn on. the blouse has crochet sleeve designs and also a very pretty neck bib area. it fits me tts and very comfortably. i love the airy feeling of it and it actually also isn't too long on
3143	"This skirt looks very nice in person and it hugs one's cure beautifully. the hem is uneven which makes it more interesting. i am 5'2"", 120lbs, tried it in the navy/beige color in size s and size xs, and i found size xs fits better. the fabric is soft and stretchy, and it drapes well. because i am petite, the length of the normal size fits me more like a maxi skirt (it goes all the way down to my mid calf). unfortunately, the petite xs is sold out, so i have to settle with the normal size xs. sti"
3144	Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed), but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.
3145	I recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shown--and is actually a nice touch to make these different!  the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips.  i wear a 10-12 and the l is fine but i wouldn't want them any smaller.  super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute!
3146	I ordered this in black and in the print and i am super happy with both. the fabric is very soft. i've worn it with denim and khaki shorts as well as with a cute skirt for work. very versatile.
3147	Super comfy, easy to put on, and super cute! you can dress it up and dress it down! i'm usually a size s and the small fits fine, but i think the xs would have fit better.
3148	This t-shirt is great! it fits really well and is very flattering. the colors are nice, including the t-shirt color itself. the fit is perfect, including the sleeves. and it's very comfortable. my only concern is how well it will do after you wash it a few times.
3149	Nice basic top...i will get plenty of use out of this! love the neckline.
3150	I bought this top on sale - very glad i did not pay full price for it! i wash everything before i wear it. when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm - i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot, but the hole will be a little trickier, as the material is kind of filmy.
3151	Fits like a dream: not too tight, not too loose. arm holes aren't too big (a common problem for me in sleeveless retailer tops/dresses), the sweater material isn't itchy, and the pattern is unusual and eye-catching. i felt confident in this dress and received many compliments. great addition to the spring wardrobe.
3152	This is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person - a nice mix of modern and artistic, with just enough color and a flattering fit. my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day, especially at the neckline. if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin, i would recommend it for style and fit.
3153	"I'm 5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress. one of these beauties ended up in our store and i had to try it on. the sleeves are no joke - serious bell sleeves that could have looked comical with the polka dots, but is surprisingly chic. the one i purchased was a medium - never had an opportunity to try a small, which i suspect is my actual size. buying it oversized made this magical. it feels modern. i actually think because the whole sweater is oversized on me, it makes the sleeves less cartoonish."
3154	"I think these jeans are much better in person than on the picture. on the model they look a bit boxy and too loose for my taste. i am tall, slim/athletic and they fit like made for me in my usual size. they have some ""give"" and tend to get looser while you wear them, but because they are midrise they won't slide down. they are a slightly relaxed swlim fit on me. the demin is solid, the color a nice medium dark sky blue. the emobroidery and the beads are beautiful and look like they will hold up"
3155	This sweater is so lovely, i bought it first in navy and then came back for it in grey. very soft and comfortable. the back doesn't wrinkle the way you might think it would from the pics alone. very flattering. i highly recommend it!
3156	I had been looking for a new plaid shirt for fall. this one is perfect! the yellow is muted, but i really like it that way. other reviewers have commented on poor quality, but it doesn't seem that bad to me. definitely recommend!
3157	Love the fit and comfort of these jeans!!! better than my 7's and citizens. the distressing is perfect, i don't have to worry about enlarging a knee hole. like another reviewer noted the color is lighter in person. they fit true to size for me and kept their shape a 3 wears. wish a knew about these before!!
3158	This dress fits wonderfully. i can wear it causally or dress it up if i want to. great deal as well.
3159	Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.
3160	This top is exactly what i was expecting. super comfortable while still looking stylish. just covers your bum so you can wear it with leggings or jeans!
3161	The dress is well made with a great material. it is extremely long and unless you are tall it would overpower many petite women. i returned it.
3162	These pants are beautiful and so comfortable. the liner is a nice surprise. they can be casual or dressed up with a jacket. i'm so pleased to have gotten them on sale!
3163	I ordered the medium pink in a size small. the color is more of a hot pink. it runs small through the shoulders and bust (i'm 34-d). i like that it covers your bum and the detail down the back. but it is going back, i may try a medium petite in a different color.
3164	It's so hard to tell exactly what this sweatshirt looks like from the online photos. it has a white and pale sky blue tie dye look all over with a sea foam green floral print. runs tts. the floral print isn't centered on the one i received, but for $11 i'll be keeping it.
3165	I purchased this in both the green color and the grey color and am in love with both. they are much longer than last years design and it has a pretty weave to the sweater with multiple layers that sit perfectly past the hips. the fit is true to size although the fabric is quite thin and i worry about pulls. also, the sleeves are a bit long, but this doesn't bother me too much at this point. very versatile!
3166	This bra is beautiful. the lace is so lovely and soft and looks fabulous on. my only criticism is it runs very small. i am a 32 a and order the size 1 and it is snug... just order a size up (or two) and it should be perfect.
3167	This skirt is lovely and fits perfectly. the print on the front provides a great contrast to the back of the skirt and stands out. the material is thick enough to take you from fall to winter easily. and the fabric is structured enough to highlight all the right curves. a great purchase.
3168	I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size, cute, and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot, but back to the store they went.
3169	"I like the jeans a lot. they're definitely skinny fit and more like leggings -- very stretchy. i feel like they would fit all shapes and sizes because of that ""give,"" so the claim that they're flattering on everyone is probably valid. i also appreciate that there is no stonewashing, as grey jeans often seem to have -- they are all one hue from top to bottom, with a little bit of linear line texture to the fabric. the only flaw (at least i don't think it's intentional) is that the front pockets l"
3170	"Yes! yes! yes!  i buy a lot of dresses from retailer, and about once a year i hit the jackpot with a dress that hits all the marks! this dress is it!  i bought the white linen version on a whim. i never buy white dress because, 1. i don't want to look bigger than my pear shape already is, and 2. i like red wine and i that's risky in a white dress!   i don't know how this designer did it, but this dress is amazing! it's slimming and flattering and summery and current. and i am two sizes bigger"
3171	These pants are so soft and so comfortable! i was absolutely in love at first sight. however, i got the petite, because i am 5'3, and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be. i wanted them to hit right above the ankle, just like the photo, however, they are a tad longer. i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever, so i am gonna deal with the length!!
3172	This vest is simply amazing. i wear all black and throw this on top and it becomes the perfect outfit. i love that the top portion of the vest is light weight and thr fur portion is so soft. tts
3173	Long enough to wear without leggings but also great with them. i also purchase the belt pictured and it looks as good in person as it does in the photo!
3174	I'm 5' 120 lbs. i'm posting a photo. one lady was concerned about it being ok for the over 40 crowd. i wore it was a cami under. see pic. it is comfy. it has pockets and fits beautifully. i ordered a 6petite. it's a little long on me. buy i still like it and am enjoying wearing it.
3175	Although this shirt runs a little large, the snowflske and stripes makes it a classic. very comfortable shirt.
3176	I ordered this pullover in green, size large. the color is lovely and the fabric feels great. however, it was tight (even though i often wear a medium). unfortunately it will be going back.
3177	Kicky looking pants, that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight, boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice, fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids, but i guess i lied.
3178	This dress is a bit longer than photographed but i was totally ok with that. the skirt is also a bit fuller which makes the dress more formal. it's really well made and great material. i'm 5'6 123lb and bought a size 4.
3179	This top is well made and would be cute but huge. this top has no shape and is way big. back this goes.j
3180	"This top fits like shown in the pictures. however, i bought the rose color and thought it was a little ""off"". would have loved to find the ivory in my size."
3181	Very comfy and light. can be casual with jeans and boots or dress it up with a nice necklace and pencil skirt.
3182	I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material, yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7, 130 pounds, athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans.
3183	"These pants are amazingly soft and comfortable. they can be worn with cute flats and a dressier top/accessories to work or with a simple tee or tank with tennies for running errands or lounging around. these are great for multiple seasons. i'm 5'2 so they are a little long but the ruched ankle makes that look by ""by design""."
3184	Made for a straight figure - no curves. awkward bra situation as it has to be strapless because of the keyhole.
3185	I purchased the navy breton stripe version of this shirt. it's chic, versatile, and soft, a great rendition of a wardrobe classic.
3186	This top runs large. i am a 34 d and usually a medium or small. the medium was a little loose in the bust, but incredibly loose and swingy in the waist. my figure was lost in the fabric. the small was too small for me in the bust, although the waist looked more flattering. the coral color was lovely and bright and not too sheer.
3187	"I bought this blouse in black in december of 2015. like other reviewers noted, it has a bit of an odd fit with the lace being a bit constrictive across the bust and raising arms. it wasn't a deal breaker because i loved the look of the blouse. however, i just purchased this blouse in the new color blue in july of 2016 and i'm happy to say the blue color is looser and i have no problems with the lace being constrictive around the bust or arms.  - the blue blouse i just purchased is definitely l"
3188	"I stopped into retailer the other day for some ""window"" shopping and as soon as i saw this cardigan, it was love and i had to try it on. the sleeves run long on me but i'm on the shorter side so it was to be expected. everything else about this cardigan is amazing. i ran errands yesterday and it was the perfect weight for our cooler autumn weather. love this cardigan."
3189	I love this top so much that i ordered it in second color. it is shorter but still works with skirts and pants. the material is a fun texture. i didn't have any problems with the arm holes, but this may be due to being less full in the bust area.
3190	Love these pants. the design is totally different and that is what i love! i paired these with the velvet red shoes from this site - also on sale. for me these ran true to size.
3191	"Tried this on in the store in a small (i'm a size 6 in most retailer dresses) and it was enormous. i'm short (5'2"") so i knew i'd need a petite size. ordered a petite small and the length is better - still a lot of fabric, but i think a petite xs would be too small if you are curvier up top (i'm a full 34d and the petite small is just slightly tight in the bust). definitely size down in this or you'll be swimming in it!"
3192	I love the desi blouse! i got it in white and it's a little more off white than pure white, but it is a great flowy top. the touch of lace across the bust is a nice accent. the only down fall is that the sleeves are a bit puffy, but the rest of the top makes up for that.
3193	This rich color is so flattering!  i also love that it has pockets and can be worn to dressy events or can be worn in more casual settings.  the side stripes give it a young and interesting touch.  the elastic waste makes it comfortable so i know i will get lots of use out of this.  i knocked off one star because of the price.  i plan on paring this with tan sandals and a dark denim blazer to start off with.
3194	I love that this tee is so soft and is not boring! when i originally took it out of the bag, my teenage daughter did not like it. then i tried it on and she was wowed! the longer length in the back makes it very interesting. i am looking forward to wearing this with jeans.
3195	The colors are beautiful
3196	These jeans are amazing! i just got them from retailer the other day and i have worn them almost every day since! i have washed them once. the tag says to turn inside out, wash in cold, and hang dry. i was a little skeptical that they'd still be soft without the dryer/dryer sheets, but they are wonderful and do not stretch out. i will get lots of use out of them and i just wish they made them in more colors. they're very comfortable: i totally love the high rise. they're a little long but i
3197	"This pants are very comfortable, and add a little flare to my typical ""mom pajama"" look. i found them true to size; size small fit my 5'7, 135lbs frame. comfortable to sleep and lounge in!"
3198	Love this dress!!! i agree with the other reviewers, i had to size up one size, but then it was perfect. i'm 5'5, 125 lbs. and the size 6 worked great.
3199	"This is much more a blouse than a ""tee"". the detailing is beautiful and the fabric on the back is a more stuff, starched cotton, not stretchy jersey. because of that i felt like this top ran small. i had to size up."
3200	I almost bought this skirt yesterday in store, but decided against it because the fabric was subpar. the skirt i tried on was snagged and unraveled. i selected another skirt, which i purchased. as the sales associate was folding the skirt, i noticed that this one was also snagged and unraveling. despite loving the style and fit, i had to be realistic with my lifestyle and decided to return it then and there. if there were two severe snags on two skirts before even leaving the store, how would th
3201	I debated whether or not to order this dress. i love the cut and style, but i was afraid the color would not work for me. with dark hair and pale skin, yellow tends to wash me out. i was correct, but the dress was adorable. definitely size down. i usually wear a medium or 8 in retailer dresses, but based on other reviews, i ordered this in a small. might could have used an extra small. this dress certainly won't show off those 10 pounds you lost, but it is very comfortable and not overly boxy. als
3202	I got this dress for my younger sister who's in the process of losing weight. she's currently wearing a size 12 with comfort room but can occasionally squeeze into smaller sizes depending on the product. this dress is deceptively true to size. at first glance it looks like a roomy dress but the inner part of the dress zips up real tight. as a result, the boxy top part of the dress doesn't look too big and is in fact very flattering. the dress is very silky and looks as high quality as its price.
3203	It's still a bit cool here in minnesota. however, it won't be long before i can wear this lightweight, drapey but figure-flattering blouse. i am 5ft 3in and the 0 petite, fits well.
3204	This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me, the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.
3205	I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material, i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim, not the lovely light blue as pictured, another reason why i am returning.
3206	Love this top! i'm 5' 118 lbs, purchased in a medium and plan on wearing it as a dress! it is so cute!
3207	"After reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman. my regular size (small) was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well. the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me. this top definitely has no problem staying ""off the shoulder"" since i have broad shoulders it doesn't completely come off me. loving the boho-chic vibe of this!"
3208	This dress has a beautiful color and design. however it runs too big. i'm usually between size 2 or 4 on antropologie's cloths. i had to size down to size 0 to get a more fitted look like the model.
3209	I purchased this on sale, xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater, but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy, but i would say itchy and cozy!
3210	The nolan's are my favorite pair of jeans from any brand. they are skinny leg but not too tight and the material is oh so soft. i buy 1-2 sizes down as they stretch out a lot.
3211	It's a cozy sweater that doesn't make me feel frumpy, still stylish and it's not too heavy but still warm enough. it's like wearing a blanket sort of. definitely sheer with the big loom, wear a camisole under it. i got compliments the first day i wore it!
3212	I have nothing but positive comments to say about this sweater. i'm 5'6, 130 pounds and i got a medium because my shoulders are a bit wide and my sweater fits me just as it does the model. it's not bulky but it is very warm, and the colors are out of this world! a very high quality and unusual piece that will be in my wardrobe for many years.
3213	Beautiful lightweight cardigan. the sheerness is really pretty. ordered one for my sister too!
3214	Such cute tights! i saw them and had to have them. they are a thick knit - very good quality. the color is a dark navy and the little foxes and a nice pop of color. i get lots of compliments on them.
3215	Someone returned my size so i got to try it on in store. the cut is very flattering, the material is stretchy. the lace part is nicely made too. overall great piece. the petite waist did hit me a little higher than on model, i have a regular torso and short legs (and overall usually need petite)
3216	"I ordered the ""london, paris, milan"" print red top in a size 4. i go back and forth with ordering 2's and 4's but i figured that with long sleeves, i'd rather have a little room than it be fitted. my boyfriend asked if i bought it for valentine's day- the red print and the cities struck him as romantic. anyway, lovely top. lightweight material will be nice for layering during winter, and wearing on it's own in spring and next fall."
3217	I bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip - and i think it'll do just fine! it's a wonderful open-gauge knit - delicate and light, but substantial enough that i don't fear snagging it constantly. the cloth has a nice weight and drape, and while the fit is on the loose side, it does look intentional. wonderful as a pullover or by itself. i have the minty blue-green color, and it's divine. definitely worth the price.
3218	The fit of this top on me was much more boxy than on the model, maybe the fault of my fuller bust. my usual small definitely didn't reach my hips as it does hers, and appears wider. i'm not even sure the v is as deep! again, could be me. but i'm keeping the top because it is just so darn comfortable. as for not looking too top-heavy, ill just have to make it work.
3219	I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined, baggy, cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!
3220	I bought this dress for the kentucky derby. i was worried about wearing navy to an event known for bright colors, but the gorgeous lace and rosettes are light and beautiful. i paired it with a lavender hat, and i was ready for a mint julep! i usually wear a 2 or a 4, so i ordered both. the 2 fit best. i will be wearing this dress to a wedding in the fall and for many events for years to come. stunning!
3221	"I tried the regular szie in store, like the cut, need petite though (too long and a lot of fabric) - i am 5'1.5"" and 115lbs... color, unfortunatly, looke aweful on my skin tone and washed me out. would need to be more red, the striping washed out the color nad dind't look flattering on me. the cut did, however.  so, if you ahge a good hur to your skin, good dress for you, if you are palelike me, i don't recommend...  ps love hte tie waist. picture not asflattering as on person."
3222	I purchased these on sale. one thing to say, i had to return the first pai r (xs) as there was a missing section of stiching on the sema, creating a whole you can't really fix neatly. so i ordered a new pari. i usually like petite, but regular size was fine, they jsut end up being to the ankle (longer), not bunchy. i also ordered xxs peite to compare, but that was smaller on waist, almost not comfortable), and the laced-up part looked a little weird/overstretched. i have not used htem to work ou
3223	So this is still a pretty cute shirt, but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective, just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front, as that is what caught my eye.
3224	I love this cardigan! i ordered the pink and it's a really pretty color. i wish it didn't run so big but xs will be cozy all winter.
3225	I loved this purchase. the dress is beautiful. it?s classy, very feminine and rich-looking. the colors and fabric are exactly as shown on a picture. it is tailored and non-stretch, so size has to be right. i am between 6 and 8 and my size m dress fits well. had to spend time shopping for a belt as the dress definitely needs one. gorgeous dress!
3226	$78 for a pair of sweats seems like a lot of money, but not when you consider the amount of wear you will get out of these pants. they are thin and a little on the long side, but very flattering. plus, the thin material makes them perfect for summer nights. i love the pockets. not a big fan of the tie on the front, but that's just a personal preference. i won't just be wearing these on the weekend. i found lots of fun tops and jackets in my closet that will turn these pants into something i'll b
3227	I love this skirt! as a fan of different textures and pretty things, this piece exceeded my expectations! i am always a size 0 or 2 in retailer dresses and the 2 fits like a glove. the length is perfect - just above the knee. ever since i wore a valentino dress with a similar thick, neoprene material, i've adored the feel of it! everything feels firm and put together. the colors in this skirt are beautiful and the pattern is feminine and romantic. it will pair well with lots of different tops too!
3228	"I had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be. it was tts (i'm 5""3 and usually wear a small). but the material was horribly scratchy. both the body of the top as well as the sleeves. and the design isn't all that flattering. it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life!"
3229	I got this in the royal blue.it is absolutly beautiful.
3230	I typically wear a 4 in dresses, and sized up to a 6 because of the other reviews. i'm bigger on bottom than on top, and the 6 fit me fine (snug, but fine) on the bottom but the top was a bit big. there was too much material in the arm hole area. it's very pretty and good quality, but not a good fit for pear-shapes.
3231	This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.
3232	"I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4"" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest, but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this, but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though."
3233	Beautiful dress but i had to returned because the size large was a little big
3234	Super cute and more fitted than the baggy overalls of yesteryear. i love them.
3235	This dress is so beautiful it makes me feel like a goddess, lol. i'm normally a 10/12 or m/l and took a 12. i think the 10 would have worked too. everything from the colors, fit and flow of the dress is wonderful. i didn't have any problem with there being too much fabric as some of the reviews mentioned.
3236	Love this tank. material and fit are great. love that it's reversible. highly recommend!
3237	"My new favorite cozy and stylish ""go-to"" piece for everything from park with the kiddos to mat class to impromptu financial meetings."
3238	This sweater would have been a better fit for me if the sleeves were slightly larger and had a button/snap on the front. the material is soft and comfortable. black pairs well with jeans.
3239	Love this top! bought it in the relish color - loved it so much bought the green too! usually wear a small but the medium was perfect.
3240	"So i tried on the regular size in the store, and love the top, but looked too big on me.  color is gorgeous and rich, the sheer adds a little whimsical to it, and i love the tie-neck trend of lately. would go nicely with jeans (skinny or flare) or trousers, not sure about a skirt though,."
3241	Comfortable, thick material ( think: structured sweatshirt material) easy to throw on and look as if effort was made - when it wasn't. sizing. i'm between a large and xl usually. large was perfect. i'm tall and curvy: ( 36g curvy) and this cardigan/ belted jacket/is very flattering.
3242	Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes, contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex, and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters, sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece!
3243	"Unlike the other reviewers, i did not have any problem with the sizing, fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think it's suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 5'8"", 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good."
3244	"The fabric, so diaphanous! so flowy! the pattern, so pretty with such interesting colors. it could literally go with anything! purple, yellow, orange, green, they're all in there. but here's the but....  i have no waist! and when you put this type of empire silhouette on me, i look like i'm wearing a sack, or i have some pregnancy news--when i don't. i tried belting it : waist tie is too high; i tried putting on a vest, too annie hall and called too much attention to the sleeves, while adding"
3245	I initially bought this in the brown in a small but ended up exchanging it for an xs in ivory. as other reviewers have said, it's not the softest sweater you'll try on. if you want it to lightly hug your body like the way it is on the model, you may need to size down. while i love the style, it feels like the type of material that will get stretched out easily so i've been careful getting it on and off. i picked this up during retailer days and got it on sale. the quality is of the yarn is just of
3246	"Nice dark indigo with minimal fading. medium denim thickness, with stretch. i bought size 25 and it is snug, but doesn't squeeze. my hip is 34.5"" and 28"" waist. love these. i will be getting them hemmed up to ankle length. i am 5' 5"" and find the little kick out at the ankle (from getting them shortened) to be very cute and classy. if you keep them full length to your shoe, they will have a slightly baggier bootcut look. these remind me of my point sur hightower straight leg jeans, with maybe an"
3247	I love the style of this top, and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty, and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes, unfortunately they cut the armholes really big, so when you put your arms forward, the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway, but for $98 dollars i thin
3248	"I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod"
3249	"Great sweater. long and warm, but not too thick. i am 5'4"" and ordered a medium. fits and hangs nicely."
3250	I've been waiting for this to go on sale, and just picked one up in store. the details and style of this blouse do not disappoint! since it's billowy in nature, a size smaller fits me perfectly.
3251	I am a 32dd, 5'4'' and 125lbs and this top was way too baggy. it looked awful. this is shapeless and oversized. i would size down or just pass.
3252	On the hanger, this dress looks a bit boxy, however once on, it has a beautiful flow and elegance to it. it's super feminine and cinches in at the waist perfectly. my one (major) complaint that prevented me from purchasing the dress? there's no give to the dress. i wasn't able to lift my arms up past 90 degrees and that's sort of a problem. it's a shame though because the outside shell is gorgeous and so structured, and it would have been a nice contrast to the shape of the dress on a body.
3253	I love this maxi dress. it is fitted up top and very maxi like on the bottom. it was to much fabric for me, the dress made me look heavier than i am. i am 5'9' and 160. i fit in the medium. the dress just didn't do anything for my body type - curvy. i think you need to be fairly lean to look nice in this dress. sadly, i had to return. maeve makes great maxi's, unfortunately they don't fit me correctly.
3254	"Drawn to the colors, i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist, size 10/12 or l in fitted tops this top is a cropped, even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement), but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full, so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up, too. the quality is an issue, with exposed threads and irregular seams."
3255	Bought in white. it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear.  the white is pretty sheer. will return.
3256	Love this top. comfy, soft, and a great length. slightly longer in the back, and works great with leggings or jeans. i love that is has long sleeves. i wish it came in more colors.
3257	I loved this dress when it came out last spring in gray. this year, i got the red and sand color. it wears so easy and can be dressy or casual- depends on how you want to wear it. i would say each color fits differently, try them on. the dress is worth the price.
3258	This top looks great with a long straight skirt (the grey with a black skirt....) and skinny jeans. i can understand why the style might not work for everyone but for me it's a perfect blend of elegant and funky. i'm sometimes a medium sometimes a large and the medium work well for me, so if in doubt size down
3259	Bought these in store and bought another on line. super comfortable and great for a casual look. great length as well! love the pilcro line.
3260	"This dress is gorgeous! i absolutely love the embroidery. a note about the sizing- while the top portion fits snugly, the hip section runs slightly big. i was surprised to find that the 4 i ordered looked baggy, so i went into the store to try a 2, but the 0 was the best fit! however i'm small-chested (and 5'6"" 113lbs), so i was able to go with the 0 as it fit the hips much better. if you're a bustier type though, the top may be tight. other than the tricky sizing, it's perfect."
3261	Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape, but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long, but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.
3262	Just got this dress in an xl. i've never ordered from retailer before so i expected their clothes to run small. i was wrong. it's a beautiful high quality dress but i think it's just too big. i may end up exchanging it for a l. definitely size down in this dress!
3263	This is a beautiful blouse. great colors and detailing - i absolutely love the design in the back. will look great with white skinny jeans. it does run a bit on the short side but i have a long torso and it still works. i waffled between the 6 and 8 (am usually an 8 and a full b cup).  in sleeveless tops i really like the arm holes to be snug enough to cover that unattractive part between the underarm and breast, so i was considering the 6 but ultimately decided the 8 did so with a bit more comf
3264	This dress ran small in the arms for me. when i returned it for a bigger size, the dress i got had a huge rip in the decorative threading on the back. i can't believe the product wasn't checked for flaws this huge before shipping. i asked for another one in the same size. we'll see if it, too, is defective
3265	I saw this in store, but they didn't have my size and i balked at the price. however, i kept thinking about it and once i received it from online i now think it's well worth it. the quality is very nice and it fits tts. i like that the arm materials is stretchy. i've worn this with jeans, but will also wear it with a skirt to the office. it's got enough weight to function as a light spring jacket. the color matches the photo and is a nice neutral to go with many things.
3266	Yay for the return of shirts that show your form but don't reveal the flaws! i bought this in cream which only seems to be in stores right now. the stripes on the cream version are vibrant and beautiful. the weight of the top is very nice and really hugs your shape. i did think it ran a tad small. i bought the large but also could have worn the medium.
3267	They are beautiful! they fit amazingly! they ripped on a seam the third time i wore them. i kept wearing them, because again, the fit! the style! alas, about the fifth time i wore them, the other leg ripped at the knee seam. they are just totally falling apart. it's so very sad. i would wear them alllll the time if they could bear it. i'm actually thinking of buying another pair because i love them soooo, but it would likely be wasted cash as i believe there is a real manufacturing issue here. w
3268	"Classic retailer piece that i am so happy to have in my wardrobe. high quality all wool felt jacket. unlined, stretchy comfortable knit. i wear mine as a knit blazer and love it. it is not merino soft, but soft enough to wear over a long sleeve tee. the neck does not itch.   fits tts, i wear a l and that is my normal retailer size. i am tempted to get the cream as well!"
3269	This dress is really beautiful. i have already worn it to both an engagement party (fancy) and just out to dinner (casual); it fits most occasions, depending on what you pair it with, which always makes me feel like i have gotten my full money's worth. i've gotten several compliments on it; the best one being that it looks as though i was wearing a piece of art! the outside material of the dress is silky in texture and has a nice sheen to it. it looks true to the picture on the website. the dres
3270	Great shirt. i couldn't picture the material but it's washable and great for hot days when you want to look styling.
3271	Love this top. pretty colors and don't forget to notice the black lace at the bottom. can easily be dressed up or down with jeans or cigarette black pants and heels. everyone looks good with bare shoulders, so this is a definite for my fall / winter season.
3272	Saw this in the store and loved it! the photos on line do not do this justice. material is soft and substantial. if you love the look of raw edge you'll love this piece. as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only 5' but kept it and love it.
3273	Thank you retailer for a collection that includes dressy mid-length dresses suitable for special occasions! the simplistic beauty, quality of workmanship, and form fitting style of this dress is perfect. the fit and flare enhances curves and hides flaws. it pairs perfectly with the necklace shown and a cropped lace front cardigan that i found elsewhere. admittedly, i am not sure that younger clients would be happy with the tea length, but i am ecstatic!
3274	This skirt was very figure flattering, and the elastic waist is comfortable and does not cut into my sides! has a great look
3275	This dress i received is stylish, comfortable and very nice to wear. i love the length, goes just below the knee and i am 5'2 so it is perfect for me. i can't say enough about this dress as i can't wear a lot of things because i am apple shaped but with this dress no one would ever know. thank you retailer for this beauty!
3276	Love! received so many compliments! it can be dressed up or down and is so comfortable.  i did order a l  based on the reviews, but found it to be big.  i would've returned for a m, but it was sold out and i didn't want to risk not having it at all so i kept.
3277	Disappointed in the quality of the dress. love the style and especially the colors. the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made. the top bodice is more substantial. not worth the price tag of $148.00. dress does run short.
3278	"I didn't end up keeping this, and i feel like i might regret it. ;) i have a similar sweater. this jacket is super streamlined with a sleek fit. the bummer for me was that it didn't have snaps to hold the collar down to the jacket when it was unzipped, so the flaps seemed to flop around. the s was perfect. not too tight. i'm 5'8"", 140 lbs, 34c."
3279	Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful, but it also stops the material from stretching, so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also, they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger
3280	"I took the advice of the other reviewer and ordered a medium in this (32d, 31"" waist, 38.5"" hips) instead of my usual small. it fits perfectly--a tiny bit loose like on the model. i bought the beige. you need a camisole underneath but the layered effect is very pretty. it is a delicate material which is why i gave it 4 stars. i can't speak to the quality of it, but will definitely use a hand wash cycle and line dry it. very pleased."
3281	After readying the reviews of this dress, i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy, was i wrong! first, this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o' one size fits all' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall, the entire dress was not flattering. honestly, i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it.
3282	I love this jacket! it is super soft and a gorgeous color. i can wear it with jeans and a tee or dress it up and wear it to work. so versatile! a must have for the fall season!
3283	"It's always sunny when i wear this sunshine yellow tee.  love the color and they way it was pieced together.  has a flattering feminine fit whole still feeling relaxed and casual.  it's slightly sheer but not obscene.  all linen and a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i purchased medium and i'm 39/28/35 140# 5'3"""
3284	"I love the fabric, since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance. this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric. the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down)."
3285	This is a great dress from moving to summer into fall. it's great right now with the warm temps, but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit. it's very comfortable also. there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front. i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through. maybe, you can adjust it at the straps some. at any rate, it's a nice dress and i'm keeping it.
3286	"I received these as a christmas gift. they are really cozy: warm, soft and super comfortable. however, they stretch out a lot, as there is no drawstring or elastic on the waist band. this leads them to poof out a lot and i have to keep pulling them up. this is fine for hanging out around the house, but not if you want to wear them out and about. i'm keeping them because they're so comfortable, but beware how much they stretch. (i am 5'6"", 130 lbs and the size small fits well)."
3287	I first saw this sweater coat in the retailer catalog that i got in the mail. i thought it was beautiful. so ethereal! i never thought that i would own it, though because of the initial price. i never thought it would make it to clearance. to my surprise, it did, and then went the extra 30% off! i took the plunge. i followed the advice of the other reviewers, and ordered a size down, a small. i am glad that i did. i still feel like i get the oversized, wrapped in warmth feel. it is not a figure fl
3288	So cute, warm and fashionable. i ordered a size down and it fit like i was in a sausage casing. gave that size to my daughter and i will order my usual size. the arms are small and the rest is true to size. love the quality softness and style of this. with a hood, for the win!
3289	Very pretty. love the design both front and back
3290	I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today, and while the fit was great, i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather, i'm sure. i liked them, but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive, i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work, but sadly, back they go.
3291	Color, style, adjustability, easy fit, flattering!  yes on so many levels!  oh wait it's on sale!  fantastic, magnificent and pretty!  i bought medium and in 39-28-35
3292	I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso, this would work great. if not, unfortunately, its not great - tear
3293	"Measurements: 30aa / 24"" waist 5'4""  i historically wear 00p in jcrew and most retailer brands. i purchased a 0p and it fit well with a little room. i really hated that the waistline is almost a drop-waist. the ivory brocade panel comes low on the navel, so it makes you look shorter than you really are.  the most impressive part of this dress is the neckline/shoulder. i have pretty narrow shoulders, so it's a quasi-boatneck and it's quite lovely."
3294	Love this tee. it has a drapery cut which i love. the only thing i found was that it ran a bit smaller.
3295	What attracted me to this beautiful piece is the lure of angel of the north quality and design. i know that this sweater/jacket will be worn and enjoyed this fall / winter and years to come; it's a classic beauty. when i put it on, it has a comfortable vibe, high quality, medium weight, dark black wool, and beautiful lines. i love the deep collar, slightly lower back hem, and inverted pleat at back waist to give a slight flare to the drape .it accents a feminine look and will be an invaluable st
3296	I have to be honest, i wear this away from the pool more than to the pool. it is extremely lightweight and comfortable, making it the perfect loungewear to tackle this california heat, and the style is fabulous- love the hassles and beads on the ties.
3297	This blouse drapes nicely. the 8 in the store was too big which is not what i usually find with maeve. i wear a 6 or small in most blouses. i ordered the 6 and it was still too big, so i hope the 4 will work.
3298	I purchased this top in the oatmeal/beige color. i love it. the material is very soft and it fits true to size. i would have purchased the black color too if it was still available.
3299	Wanted this dress several months ago, but it was out of stock. finally was able to order and very glad i did, it is perfect! it fits exactly as i had hoped, the length is great, right above my knee and it hangs beautifully. looks great with my caramel colored boots and i received many compliments. just hoping they do some more drop waist dresses, especially for summer.
3300	Love this sweater! it can be used for both work and casual wear with ease. very soft and seems durable. i highly recommend it!
3301	I am still in love with my ribboned denim dress from earlier this year. so, when i saw this dress i was super excited and ordered it right away in the same size. it just came and... i'm kinda disappointed. the fit is... shrunken?? kind of like i'm wearing a petite size. it's around 3 to 4 inches shorter, the tie at the waist hits instead right under my bust, and there's some weird bunching happening above my rear?? i kept wanting to pull the whole dress down more, but that's just the way it was
3302	This is a great fit and super cute, price not bad either!!
3303	"Very pretty dress and a bit different than what we see in the shops! i found the material to be very nice, despite one of the reviewers comments. it is a sheath that is not skin tight but shows curves - great for dancing. also i did not find the neck too tight - fits fine. tts as normally a petite 6 which is a wonderful fit and sometimes a petite 4 or 8 depending on the cut. the 8 was too large. all in all a feminine uncommon dress. looking forward to wearing it to one of the 6 weddings th"
3304	I am petite so ordered in the store and they shipped to my home. i ordered a 24p and they fit great. they stretch a tiny bit. goes with a lot of tops and they are light weight which is great with houston westher
3305	"This is a gorgeous dress that while it runs quite small ( i normally take a s or xs ). i had to exchange it for a medium. i am 5 4"" and it falls below the knee which is how i like my dresses. it is a gorgeous pattern of color which could be worn for 3 seasons. i look forward to wearing it for many special occasions."
3306	"I had to return my original order to size down - the bottom half was fine with either size, but the medium was baggy in the back torso area. (i'm 5'8"", 150#). i bought the ""tangerine"" version, which really is more red than orange. it's versatile and can be paired with various third pieces and shoes. i do have a long torso and this waist is a bit short on me however."
3307	This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.
3308	I have this top in the blue print and i love it. i'm super tempted to buy it in the black as well since i love it so much, but it might be a little pricy to have two of the same top. the only thing i will warn women about this top is that if you are busty then i would recommend going up a size. i wear a small in most retailer clothes but i went for a medium in this top. while the small did fit in al other areas, it looked like the buttons were going to pop at my bust.
3309	This dress fits like a dream and looks gorgeous on. i'm sure it will be a go to for many occasions.
3310	I love the dress as shown in the photo. thankfully i had a chance to see the dress in the store. it is sheer. can see thru it. can not wear this to work.
3311	This is my second pair of pilcro jeans and the second time i am totally impressed. these jeans have a comfortable stretch and rugged wash that is trendy & fun. they are the perfect everyday jean and look great casually with a pair of birkenstocks or converse low tops. the only thing worth pointing out is that i am pretty short (5'4) and the regular length fits me perfectly. this may be an issue for ladies lucky enough to have some extra inches on me.
3312	I love seafolly boyleg bathing suits. i find them very flattering and just universally appealing. this one has beautiful summery design as well. i found it to be running slightly smaller than plain colored editions of this suit. i normally wear size 6 (us size) of this suit, but this particular design 6 was too small and had to exchange for 8(us) which fits perfect.
3313	Bought this dress on sale in the orange as i feel like everything i have is black. it is a pretty orange not too bright, more of a rust color. it is very soft as stated in other reviews and has a nice built in slip that is very comfortable. i worry about pilling down the road but will have to wait and see. i am not crazy about the seams down the chest area. i think they could be more flattering but overall the dress is comfortable, cute and easy to wear, a perfect dress for the fall/winter with
3314	"I am so happy with this jumpsuit! it is the perfect comfortable and casual summer outfit. the fabric is super soft. i was unsure about the length at first because it's shorter than my other jumpsuits, but if you scrunch up the bottom of the legs and add some sandals, it's a great look.  highly recommend!"
3315	This dress has a great design for any frame. it looks great with a belt to accentuate the waist but the dress stands great alone and doesn't require a lot of styling.
3316	I love this skirt. it is stylish and very comfortable. ladies, don't be afraid of wearing a pattern on the bottom. it is flattering and slimming. i wear it with a black wrap sweater or black cotton casual jacket.
3317	"I recommend this dress for people who do not have my body type. the dress is very comfortable and nicely designed. my torso is a bit barrel chested with a large bust so the fabric both wrapped and billowed out unattractively, causing the waistband to ride up and the skirt to pouf out over my tummy. if your body is more like the model, this is a flattering dress. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140# and ordered the medium petite. perhaps if i bought the non-petite version or sized down maybe it will"
3318	Overall, it's a beautiful dress, and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you'd expect for the price), and as other reviewers have mentioned, it's just a tad too short. for reference, i'm 5'5, 125 lbs and the 2 fit well, but hung well above my knees. there's no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned.
3319	"Cute shirt. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. size s fits perfectly. a little shorter in the back than i'd like but great for layering."
3320	This dress is very pretty, versatile and high quality! i'm planning to wear it to a wedding. with the holiday season coming up, i will definitely get to use it as well. the fabric is very comfortable especially the top part; it's very soft. i usually wear an xs petite, this dress seems to be a liiiiiittle too long for me and the waist is a tiny bit too loose from how i like it but it's manageable. (i have this dress in ivory top)
3321	The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality.
3322	I didn't really pay this dress much attention online or even in store. an associate suggested i try it on. it's so much cuter on than it appears online. the button detail is great and i love the pockets. it does bunch up a little but not too bad. i tried on my normal size 2 or 4 and the 4 fit me perfectly. it was a tad long and maybe the petite will be better. i have fairly sensitive skin and the wool pieces were a bit itchy so i had to take it back. but if you aren't sensitive then this is for
3323	Really love this bathing suit. it fits very well, definitely don't need to size up for this one. flattering to my mom-bod and breasts that have seen perkier days. excited to be taking this one to costa rica with me this summer!
3324	This romantic top has lovely embroidery and beading details. i purchased this in purple, which is actually more of a cranberry color. i like that the detail work carries over to the back on the cap sleeves.
3325	"Drapes very nicely and runs true to size. easy to wear alone or layer a jacket/cardigan over. i purchased this on sale, and it was a good buy. i am 5'8"" and purchased the size m, as i am a pretty true size 6."
3326	I ordered this top (black) in both small and medium; i can get usually away with small at retailer but am size medium in all other stores. as soon as i received the package and opened it up, i knew i would keep this top. it has a gorgeous texture to it, a slight sheen, and is well made. it's extremely comfortable as a t-shirt would be, but has more structure and looks very chic. the waist nips in just enough to give the flutter hem a little flare at the hips and is very feminine. i have a long tor
3327	"Just, you know, in front of my mirror and around the house. i bought this piece because i found it to be a bit funky - so you can wear it with jeans for a night out - yet with classic elements so it could be worn to work with a skirt. also, i live in florida, where it is hot hot hot, but i still like to layer my look. it has an excellent weight to it without being to heavy, so it flows well and can be worn even on the warm days instead of a suit jacket.   i am usually between a small and mediu"
3328	This dress was adorable & fit great! regrettably, i had to return it since it wasn't lined.
3329	Very comfortable shirt.  washes up nicely with just a little ironing on the pleats.  cute detail of colored thread on buttons.  just a tad tight in the shoulders but not distracting.  no button placket chest gapping.
3330	"Very comfortable fabric and fits nicely. i am 5'10"" like it states the model is, and it falls shorter on me that viewed, but still looks nice. it will be an easy dress to use for different looks."
3331	"I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm, no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b, weigh 110 pounds, 5'3"" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!"
3332	"So there weren't any product reviews to go by when i ordered the last small. i had no way of knowing if it ran big, small, or tts. i'm usually a med, but to my surprise the small worked due to the fluid pleating. it sits right on my natural waistline similar to the model and not too short in length (i'm 5'8""). i also like the med weight of the fabric it moves freely when you walk, but not too light. it is similar to a double weight georgette or crepe."
3333	"I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber, which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 5'8"" frame so the shirt tail hems peeked"
3334	"This is the second dress i buy at retailer this year and this one is spot on!! exactly what i was looking for: feminine, dressy yet can be dressed up or down depending on the circumstance. the fabric in this dress is particularly gorgeous, very comfortable on the skin, very flowy so it doesn't have a ""heavy"" quality to it and the design is amazing with the navy ribbon on the front. i completely fell in love with this dress! this is a little number to keep for many years."
3335	This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique, flowing, romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like, fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!
3336	"I bought this tunic today because it paired well with patterned slim pants. at 5'2"" the tunic felt like it added height and even though i'm a 34f the top fit well across the bust. i tried on the large first, and it felt very comfortable but a bit big. the medium fit a little more snugly, but was more proportional in the arms, so i purchased it instead. the neckline is not too low and does not require a camisole under and the buttons add a nice weight so that the top drapes towards my chest inst"
3337	"I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular size 27 (5'4"", 27/35, 116bs) and they fit me just perfect so they are tts. they are super soft and there's just enough stretch in these that i'm able to bend easily yet they retain their shape nicely. the pockets in the front are super cute in person and the back gives a really cute look. the color is just as shown in the picture, a nice shade of blue that's in the middle plus they are really incredibly soft. i'm only 5""4"" but found the regular"
3338	I knew going in that it may not fit a d cup but the fabric is beautiful so i thought i'd give it a try. i wear a 36d and bought a large. it's got a clasp in the back so there's no adjustment on how it fits around which for me was too big. the triangles did not provide enough coverage, left too much side boob. the fabric was very pretty in person but thinner than i expected which also made it seem less sturdy. sadly, have to return and cancel the back-ordered bottoms. i would recommend to someone
3339	"This dress is amazing! it fits true to size, very flattering and the fabric is beautiful! i am 5'4"" and it felt a little long for me so i am having it hemmed up one inch, but others may like the hemline just as it is. i like my dresses just right above my knee and it was hitting in the middle of my knee. just love everything about it and would definitely recommend it highly!"
3340	I absolutely adore this skirt! sadly it was a lot of skirt for me- i'm 5 feet nothing and it would have been too much fabric to hem. wish this skirt came in a petite size. great color and a fun option for the fall wedding season!
3341	This shirt was a cute print, but it was too boxy and hit too short on the thigh. i considered having it taken in the waist but ultimately decided it wasn't worth paying the extra $ on top of the $88
3342	"I was looking for a stylish spring/fall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill. i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket. i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me. i can't wear it enough! i am a short 5'2"" but 36d and have 31"" waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best. as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room! i am normally a 12/14 so i was surprised by this. if you are on the"
3343	I tried this on in store and since my usual size 6 wasn't available i tried on a 4. it was a little snug in the upper sleeves and shoulders but was lovely otherwise. i passed on it and waited for it to go on sale to order it online. i got it in my usual size 6 but it seemed to me like it was 2 sizes bigger than the 4. i have decided to keep it but i just wasn't thrilled with the fit.
3344	The sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy, too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body. i like the fabric (nice and thick) but it did not work for me.
3345	I love these jeans! perfect amount of stretch without sag. great color.  ordered my usual size 28. i wish they had these in olive and black!
3346	Soft, comfortable, stylish. i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed. the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne. the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time. very versatile.
3347	This is a fun little dress, with a nice double seam bodice detail. i'm large busted and it's very flattering. also, in my size (12) the hem hit just at the top of the knee, which i prefer. great with tights and booties, or boots. cute with a sweater. all around very wearable and a nice holiday option.
3348	Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
3349	Love this layering piece! a little low cut for my personal comfort, but a tank underneath works great.
3350	Beautiful dress. i just wore this dress for my wedding. it was a beautiful wedding dress and i got many compliments on the uniqueness and the beading detail. there was one really big problem. the beads and the flowers kept falling off. i sat down and stood up leaving a pile of little flowers and beads. i could be standing still and they would periodically drop off. it was kind of embarrassing and everyone remarked that i was my own flower girl. i am still finding pieces of the dress everywhere.
3351	I can't believe this top hasn't sold out. it is a great casual top that will go well with anything. i agree with previous reviewer that talked about sizing up to cover straps. i did size up to a large but it didn't get huge around the midsection. i got the red and it will go great with pilcro khakis or denim.
3352	Has it been 5 years already. i too bought this 5 years ago. it peels and doesn't close but the horses make up for that. very very warm.
3353	I love this blouse! it is such a classic silhouette. the fit is not so loose on me as the model, but i have a much more curvy figure at a size 14/large. i am completely coverd up in this top, and the waistline is incredibly flattering to a full figure. the lace makes this top easily able to go from dressy to casual. i can see myself wearing this top again and again. great purchase.
3354	"-like others, i agree that this is a staple that will pair with many, many outfits. it is really well-constructed, classic, comfortable, and a wonderful length for us taller gals. as you can see from my stats, i'm rather tall at 5'9"", so it's hard to find"
3355	Beautiful top but runs a whole size small. gave to my daughter who loved!
3356	While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item, these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online, the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.
3357	Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.
3358	"Pros. 1) the color and texture of this skirt are gorgeous. twice as pretty as the photo . 2) you could wear this with almost any color top, black boots and youve got a great outfit! 3) the black side panels make this a very figure flattering skirt.  cons this skirt is unlined. because it's a knit skirt on some mesh it's slightly seethrough. i'll wear it with a slip, but seriously for this price it should be lined"
3359	I seriously love this skirt! i bought it for my college graduation and i was complimented by everyone that saw it. not only that, but it is beyond versatile, you can dress it up, make it casual, or make it professional. it is extremely ideal especially for the price. it also is the most comfortable skirt i've ever worn, so that's a plus.
3360	"I'm usually a small (5'5"", 116 lbs, long torso), but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures, but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close, mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however, it is rather short, possibly because it is an x-small, and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom, which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect"
3361	"I loved this top; it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white; however, on this one, the chest area is too big, in both the 14 and 16, and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big. i probably need a size 12, but then i fear it would be too short-waisted on me, for i am 5'10"". unfortunately, it is not for me. also, the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t"
3362	"I purchased the dress on a promotion.  the dress i received had the sleeves end about the elbow.  i added a 4"" black cotton lace to the sleeves.  i love the result.  it makes the design richer and brings out the lace running down the front of the dress.  the sleeves are a much better length for me now.  dress runs tts.  i purchased a medium, am 5'7"", 150 lbs, really am large boned, straight up and down."
3363	The top is huge! i wear an xs and am not the bustiest of women, but the top part of this romper felt like it belonged on a medium or large, even though the bottoms and waist fit perfectly. i was really disappointed, as i loved it in every other way.
3364	I don't understand the negative reviews on this dress. i absolutely love the fit, may be the prior reviewer was trying a size on that was too large? yes, the fabric and the snaps are very delicate so you have to be careful putting it on and off, but the fit is very flattering on most people. i saw three different people trying it on in the fitting room today so i decided to try it on myself and had to have it! the colors are beautiful and the uneven hem makes it more fun and young. i will wear i
3365	I did not have the issue that a previous reviewer did, there were ruffles on my shirt. the one thing i didn't know was how wide the top ran. i ordered my usual size 8 and it fit with no problems. i'm a 36b. the only thing is that in the model shot, the shirt is tucked into the pants and you don't get to see the full volume of it. even the model shot of the shirt from the back doesn't show the wide sleeves and body of the shirt. its not a big problem, since the shirt can be tucked but i will have
3366	I ordered size large in the denim color and tops like this are the reason i shop at retailer. this is such a sweet little floral, vertical, slimming, goes with anything print. the buttons down the front close with loops. it's easy to unbutton a few and pull this over your head. i'm a busty 34g and there's no gapping or pulling. the shirt arrived with the sleeves rolled and i had a heck of a time getting those tiny buttons into the cuff but once in, the cuff is wide enough to just slip your arm thr
3367	I'm consistently a 0p in this brand, but i ordered a regular zero, and i'm glad i did not get the petite because it would have been too cropped for me. it's a bit boxy, and the material is thicker than i thought, but it is a versatile piece that look forward to wearing!
3368	I love this shirt so much i bought it in another color. it looks like it does in the picture, loose and flowy.
3369	Love this dress. purchased in white. runs true to size. made well.
3370	I loved the color of this shirt but it does run big. i even sized down and it was still large on me and the ruffles flare out a bit which was not flattering one me. it looks pretty on the hangar.
3371	These shorts are really cute and are a flattering length. grey color has a silvery look to it. keepers.
3372	I saw this dress in the lilac at the store and loved it immediately! the picture on the website does not do it justice.
3373	I do not have an retailer where i live so i ordered this tunic online. the material is extremely soft & comfortable ( not at all itchy). tts. i fell in love with it immediately and can't believe how many compliments i received all day long when i wore it to work ( with some skinny ankle length pants). can be dressed up or down. this is certainly going to get a lot of use this fall
3374	Perfect top! the color is absolutely beautiful and the fit is better than i imagined it would be! love!!!
3375	A breath of fresh air. spring flowers! easy to wear. very feminine and flattering. looks great with denim, orange, reds , etc. very happy with this purchase.
3376	Sporty, comfortable and good option to replace jeans, however material needs to be ironed. i bought these as a nice (dressier) alternative to jeans on my trip to europe but didn't end up wearing them b/c an iron wasn't readily available and the height of my ankle boots made the style look choppy. best to wear these with shoes that don't come above ankle.
3377	A great basic t, so very much cuter than most. i have black and white both and wish it came in more colors.
3378	I'm really excited that retailer is selling basics. i love the flow of this fabric and it does not cling. i haven't worn them yet but they'll be perfect for work. i look forward to trying on the other essential styles.
3379	I wish that it had fit me better as the feel of the fabric and the color were great! regrettably, i am sending it back as the v opening is too low for my tastes and the fabric on the left of the first layer drapes weird on me. i am usually a s or m and in this top the s was plenty of length and room, would be swimming in a m. the fabric was soft and felt great against your skin and not thin as some fabrics can be. the color was just as shown and beautiful. hope it works for some of you out there
3380	"Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your ""normal"" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love"
3381	"I was in trouble when i saw this dress in the new arrivals section this month! it's one of those dresses i had to have for the holidays. i didn't want to risk it not fitting so i ordered my usual size 6 and also a size up, 8. (5'6"", 135lbs, size 6) well the 6 was entirely to tight, i couldn't even zip past my rib cage. the 8 went on, but it was very body con looking! hugged every curve! this might be the look some might be going for, but not me!! i'm so disappointed that i can't have the dress f"
3382	The design of this dress is very cute, but if you have an average to large bust, don't even think about it. returned, unfortunately.
3383	I love this jacket. i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times. the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting. it fits tts. i am typically an xl and i ordered that size- i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me. the pictures on the website don't do it justice. it looks much nicer in person.
3384	"Such a lovely, well constructed top. looks great on petite frames. free flowing but not too ""peasant-like."" the embroidery is gorgeous. while it is pricey, it is something you will wear for years as it is a timeless piece."
3385	Purchased this dress for a garden wedding and received so many compliments. the print is very lovely and the fit was true to size. i was mildly thrown off by the waffle texture of the material as it caused the dress to be a tad clingier than the picture led me to believe, but it was not a deal breaker. loved that it was lined and, though feeling substantial, was not heavy and thus comfortable in 90 degree weather. looking forward to wearing this again.
3386	I wear this vest a lot for it is really cozy and goes with a lot of different types of outfits! it's is versatile and figure flattering. i only buy timeless pieces that i know won't go out of style and this vest fits the bill!
3387	"This is a lovely, well-made piece by maeve, a longtime favorite of mine. the material is great weight and won't wrinkle, colors are vibrant, and design of the dress is cute, if a bit on the short side.  however, i, like some of the other reviewers, didn't love this this on me. the waist hit slightly above my natural waist (and i'm very short-waisted) and this particular sweetheart neckline did nothing to flatter my bust (i'm a 34dd for reference). the end result was a bit too dowdy on top with"
3388	Thank you to all of the reviewers who took the time to write a review. your reviews are what help me know exactly which size to order and how to know that i needed a regular instead of a petite. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a size 8 in retailer sizes. i went with a medium regular based on other reviews. thanks so much because the fit was perfect though still a little roomy.
3389	As other reviewers have said, this is the perfect summer maxi dress! i'm tall, just under 6 feet, and while the dress could be just a bit longer it still works for my height. i do wish the skirt was lined, but other than that the dress is excellent. worth buying at full price if you're worried about it selling out!
3390	I ordered these without reading the previous reviews and i would have to agree with everything everyone has already said. these are the cutest cords i've seen in a long time! they're definitely skinny, bridging on way too skinny through the calves but i'm willing to stick it out. the thing that bugs me about them is how stinking short they are?? the description doesn't really mention that they're crops but at this length any ankle bootie is going to be too short. also, they aren't navy. they're
3391	"I ordered this top in the pink in a medium (i usually wear a small or medium in retailer shirts). it fit tts with not being too short. the embrodiery is very pretty, better in person than online. my only complaint is it's a bit blousey, so you would need to either tuck it in or wear with skinny jeans/shorts. for reference, i am 5"" 4.5""' 135 lbs and a 32c."
3392	This dress is great! i purchased the navy colorway. it is really soft and the fabric flows nicely. i was lucky enough to snag this on sale so i couldn't beat the price. i like the buttons on the sleeves. it adds just a cute special touch. i'm 5'3 and this hits me right at the knee.
3393	Very flattering and looks much better on than on the mannequin in store. i an in between small/medium and went with medium which was looser in back and did not show any lumps or bumps. great with jeans, pencil skirts and capris .
3394	I love love love this cardigan!! i ordered it in plum, regular small as they were out of petite small ( my preferred size). i was very impressed with the quality of the cardigan. the details like the sheer fabric around the neckline are very delicate and beautiful. the waist line sits exactly where it should. i was worried it would sit too low as i am short and did not get this in petite sizing. so maybe i should say this cardigan runs small. i think i have found the perfect cardigan. it goes wi
3395	I loooove this. my favorite retailer purchase in a while and i buy frequently. ran out of s p while in my basket (there are never enough petites available) so i got the medium. it is big but with this style i can pull it off. it does run a bit large so a s would have been perfect. please make this in more colors/fabrics! i would buy them all!
3396	Got this on a whim and boy i'm very pleased! it's flattering and the material is perfect for spring weather. size up as mentioned by other reviewers.
3397	I love the cut and style of this simple striped tank! it's good fabric
3398	"I saw this dress online first and suspected i would like it, but the price scared me away. then, while visiting in portland, i saw it on sale at an retailer store. when i came out of the dressing room to look in a bigger mirror the store clerk said, ""well that's a no-brainer!"" i thought the same thing. i love this dress so much i actually would have paid full price for it. it's super fun and easy to wear; i paired it with navy blute tights and suede ankle booties. i'm 5'6, 138 lbs and the m"
3399	I see no one has reviewed this yet and since it is a beautiful sweater, and only available online, i thought i would contribute an opinion. the sweater is nicer in real life than the photo. it has a wonderful feel! the style: this sweater has very dramatic sleeves which i like though i could understand how that might annoy someone else. it is made with a heavy thick soft yarn so the sleeves hang nicely. i have worn it once and got complements so it is a sweater that while simple, is also a stand
3400	This is one of my favorite recent retailer purchases. i wore it to work and a presentation. many people commented on how much they loved my top, and then turned back around to take a second glance to realize it wasn't paisley but leopards and tiger prints. it's really fun and fits well. great for work or dressed down with jeans.
3401	I don't if it is me, but usually i am a solid size 6, occasionally an 8.  i had to size up to a 10! the wool is very light, and while it is a weird texture, it isn't scratchy. i liked how the skirt was styled at the store...looks better than it does in the photos online.
3402	Beautiful,well made top.it just runs small not for me
3403	I bought this blouse in both the cream and the blue. both are lovely. i would say that the size runs a bit large, i bought size 12 and the bodice hangs away from my back, arms fit well though, loose fit. hangs well. the lace is nice and stiff. the cream has some cafe au lait shading on some of the lace so it could almost look stained. i don't think that will be how it reads, though, but fair warning.
3404	I absolutely love this blouse...i ordered it in peach..then waited for the raspberry to come back in my size...now i have 2 colors...it runs really large....but putting a tank or cami underneath is fun :-)
3405	Wore this romper 1x and after washing, the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again, i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.
3406	"Great fit. love the mid rise! my usual size 28 in these leggings hug in all the right places. they look on me as in the model pic except the length falls abt 1"" below my ankles. i may have them hemmed after they're washed. just wait & see... 5'3"" 117#"
3407	Really cute fun print. nice summer dress..
3408	"Whoa! these are very high-waisted. but i think i like it! this is a very 70s style with the high waist and wide legs. the brown motif is kinda funky! i am a 70s/vintage lover though, so i was pleasantly surprised. the tall length is more than adequately long for my 6'2"" frame. i may need to take them up a little bit, in fact."
3409	Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.
3410	I love these pilcro cropped chinos. i ordered them in the sand and will be ordering them in the grey. they are very soft and comfortable
3411	"I can't get over how fabulous this looks on, how well it fits, and how flattering it is. i'm 5'8"" and size 8/10 on a good day. seriously - i'm so happy about it ! i plan to get a lot of wear out of it - works for a wedding, evening out, or the office."
3412	I absolutely loved these pants the first several times i wore them. the fit is flattering, they are a perfect long length, and the colors are stunning. after several wears, it was time to wash them and i followed the directions provided to wash with cold water and line dry. i was initially horrified with the amount that these pants shrunk in fit and length and the colors ran together. after a lengthy ironing session, i was able to smooth out the material and restore much of the length and fit bu
3413	I love the look of this dress but wish the bottom was lined like the top is. it's a little sheer without the lining.
3414	Like others are saying, the sleeve and bust are running small.  i found out that when i was trying the blue color one (butterfly).  however, before trying the blue one, i tried the neutral color one at my local store in the same size (s), it fit me perfectly, no issue with the sleeve and bust.  i don't understand why they're different.
3415	Great boyfriend style jeans. run large, though - i had to order a size down.
3416	Very pretty. runs true to size. waist is higher than in the photo, as other reviewers have stated. correct fit is important because the arm openings are a little big, i thought, and when i sized up to try to get the waist a little lower, the arms were too large.
3417	Love the top! it fits perfectly. i was a bit worried it would look like a pregnancy top on me as i'm a 34dd, but it doesn't. i've received many compliments on the top, its incredibly well made and has beautiful detailing. it is sheer so you'll need something under. the material is quite light as well which is nice.
3418	I just purchased this adorable top at my local retailer store, not really expecting to find anything, i saw this one so i tried it on in my usual size small and it fit me perfectly (34d-27-35). i bought the black with the colorful print and think it's even prettier in person. it looks cute with the ties either open or closed and the material is nice and soft. also, the arm holes aren't too large which is always a nice plus:)
3419	I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful, both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees, not like shown in the picture here. on that note, i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.
3420	These are a wonderful trouser style pant. i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isn't my top pick but it's a cute style! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut.
3421	"This is a beautiful dress with unfortunate design flaws at the bodice of the dress. the fit at hips and length is perfect, falling just to my knee (i'm 5'5"" 142 lbs.) and grazing my hips. in that regard the fit is spectacular. but the bodice seems cut very oddly, which would require tayloring to correct. the armholes are large and flared at the bottom which leaves 'wings' just under the arms that stick out. since this dress has a side zip, to correct that would seem a major undertaking. the stra"
3422	Fit true to size and very well. hit the leg at a good length. i'm 5'5. they were perfect.
3423	These pants run small by two sizes or so. nice material, color true to picture.
3424	This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!
3425	The sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area. i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately. it truly is a great tank top!
3426	When i saw this top.... i had to have it.....runs very small... would size up especially if curvy on top.......sheer but not too sheer...... feels and looks delicate...... no problems so far
3427	The rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured. i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket. the print is great, i love it! it's so different than any other jackets ive seen. while the jacket is ã¼ber cute, it is a bit bulky (though the waist tie helps with that) and its not heavy winter appropriate ( it's not waterproof or heavily insulated). for your average winter day though, it will be a fun option! the removable v
3428	This jumpsuit is so so comfy i can't wait to wear it! def runs on the large size.
3429	Cute casual drawstring short. runs a little large but nice style for an oversized look. nice length for long legs.
3430	To my surprise this sweater is heavy, chic and stylish. its well made and fits tts. i'm looking forward to wearing it. i would recommend this tunic to everyone. it looks better on me than the model.....event though it doesn't look bad. you need curves to enhance the look of this tunic sweater. i really like all the different textures in this sweater.
3431	"This is a very pretty sweater, a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look."
3432	Great fabric, not too clingy and provides a forgiving sillhoette. very comfortable. perfect skirt for summer get togethers or shopping. may be a little long if you are on the short side. one thing i liked is that the skirt draped well and doesn't hang open or slide up. recommend particularly on sale.
3433	"Love this top. bought it in both color ways. just adorable and washes well. great option for larger ladies.  retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores. i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me, and there is nothing for us. it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you, but you don't want it."
3434	I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice,  but if it sits at my natural waist,  the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad,  i love the print and ease of this design.
3435	This dress is beautiful on, is thin enough to be extremely comfortable. being curvy, it feels a little more narrow than i would prefer, but i kept it anyway because it is so beautiful as well as functional.
3436	Love these. wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots. nice subtle print. i think they run about 1 size small. i'm normally a size 0/25. the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled. size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough. incidentally, i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too. love love
3437	Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend.
3438	"This is a very well made swimsuit with soft foam cups and fully lined. the shoulders stay put with thin strips of foam that are sewn in. very comfortable and easy to move in; my arms have full range. the color is like the online photo, and to the teal close-up i posted of the shoulder area. . the size 'm' that i ordered fit my bust very well with smooth lines and decent support. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37, 30d / 32c bra, with a average to long torso with a full bottom and thighs. i think the"
3439	Love this dress. it is so comfortable. it fits great and can be dressed up or down. hides the tummy, too.
3440	"I was so in love with this dress when i saw it in the store but so disappointed when i put it on. i am 5'10"" with curves and usually buy a large in dresses. this dress looked like a sack on me. the top was way too big and loose making the dress a boxy cut rather than a maxi cut like i was expecting. the dress is lovely to look at on the hanger and feels good on but i don't think it flatters hourglass figures. it was the right length for me unlike many other reviewers.  obviously, based off the"
3441	Ok, received this in the mail yesterday and tried on this morning, i ordered the size 2 snd it is really big. i notice that the armhole sag and there is a lot of extra room everywhere. i am a 32d on the top so that is why i ordered the size 2, but i will return this and order the size 0 and i hope that will take care of the sagging arm area
3442	Loved the look, quality was great, but didn't work for me. too busy and off-fitting. i did return.
3443	Very pretty design. hugs the body correctly. it's a little tight in the chest for me - i'm a 34c (large c) and i have some back chub so i'm using this fact to motivate me to get in shape for the spring. keeping the dress and hoping for a better fit in a few months.
3444	"I love everything about this dress! i love the colors - style and fit. it is so comfortable. i had so many people ask where i got it.  i usually wear an xs or s in retailerpolgy dresses and i got this in an xs and it was perfect."
3445	"I am a fan of these designers and their gorgeous fabrics - most of which are heavy brocades. this is so pretty and fun. the print is playful, and colors are gorgeous, and the fit is floaty but not too full or too tight. i love the bit of beading, and that i can dress it up or down.  i am petite and not usually a bigger print or long dress fan, but i know that i will wear this one for years.   i did get a 00 petite as i know that only this small size fits me at retailer - 0's swallow me. this i"
3446	More of a legging than a true pant. fits really well. grey color is great and will go with lots of things.
3447	Worth every penny. i sized down one size and they look amazing.
3448	"Couldn't make it work, even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan, like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all, just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust), then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy, curvy waist, but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape. (5'3'' 127lb 34a, tried xs)"
3449	"This skirt is absolutely lovely!! i'm usually a perfect size 8 in all retailer clothes. i am curvy on the bottom and the skirt pulls slightly, so i will be sizing up. can't wait to get my new size!!!"
3450	Okay, i am not that tall and don't have legs for miles, but i loving wearing a wide-legged cropped pant with heels for a change from the everyday. these pants are great because they are 99% cotton. the cotton is a nice weight (not too light) and the barely there fringe bottom is a nice detail. i usually wear a 28 in pilcro and that's what i bought! i would describe the color as leaning more toward khaki than green, though it did look little green under the lights in the store.
3451	I ordered this shirt in the grey/blue color choice; the creamy grey is perfectly heathered and the blue silk-like bottom is a classy touch. the fit of this shirt in the arms, torso, and back was flattering with a little room to drape. love it!
3452	"Great too. love it's flow. dolan is a great brand. however it's definitely large and baggy which is fine just know it's not tight. i'm 5' 10"" and 135 and ordered a s."
3453	This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple, black, stylish.  unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off.  the upper arms, chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.
3454	Simple, classic, figure flattering, and reasonably priced!
3455	This is a gorgeous top; however, it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?
3456	I had been eyeing this top for awhile and decided to get it when it went on sale. it is a very nice top. i'm going to pair it with jeans and boots for our florida fall but could see it working with a nice pair of pants. it is roomy so if you're looking for something more fitted than i would pass on this top.
3457	I do love this shirt, but when it arrived, it had makeup around the collar, apparently from someone else who had tried it on. i was able to clean it up with just soap and water so no big problem, but it did make for a poor first impression!
3458	"The fox print is super cute and the reason i ordered the skirt.  sizing was true to me, i'm usually an 8 and the 8 fit fine.  the waist is high and if you try to wear it low the side zipper puckers  out in a weird way.  skirt length is above knee (i'm 5' 6"").  skirt is lined but the lining is dark brown/black same as the waist band in the photo of the model wearing it.  the lining does not show at the hem, it's concealed.  overall a fun a-line swingy skirt for late summer that will go into fall"
3459	Awesome light shrug. goes with so many out fits, over tees and dresses. tts. get one! orange color is a pretty neutral.
3460	"The pics online for this dress are horrible in comparison how stunning this dress is in person. just received it and far exceeded my wildest expectations! it is elegant, classy, and an understated sexy! the colors are rich and vibrant.......gorgeous shades of plum and blue....a unique color combination that is gorgeous! the open mess dress with the solid under layer is a wow! beautiful and flattering fit. it is a 10 !!!! i ordered my usual size and i would say it is true to size, but slig"
3461	This top is just adorable! so comfy and cute. i love the cut and how it goes a little longer in the back. i will be wearing this a lot!
3462	I like the cut and look of this shirt, and tried on the xs (fits 115 lbs, 30ss chest), but i find that the t-shirts lately are kind of thin and see through... the shirt is fun, and the color is adorable, but had to pass as i could see my bra too clearly for my liking.
3463	This is my 6th pair of rockets. they've become my hands down, favorite cut from citizens. for curvy girls, these are the perfect skinny jeans. they come up high enough to tuck everything in, no muffins top. they shape and lift my butt, which i need because i've got a generous one. they hold their shape amazingly well and don't require a wash with every wear in order to regain their shape. they truly have been the holy grail of jeans, for me. with all that said, these are not a 5 star version of
3464	"Lets discuss the neckline: it's fabulous! furthermore, this sweater can go anywhere, it's dress up, dress down.  feeling low? this girl will lift you up and take you to town."
3465	I loved the criss cross part of this tank. however, it looked so frumpy on. the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent. i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on. i returned it. the material felt nice too.
3466	"The craftmanship & material (not itchy at all to me) are exquisite for this unique sweater/coat, but the shape is not for me. i have a slender build, 5'8"" 130 lbs, 34 b chest (i oredered my usual sm, which fit), and the silouette of this piece looked ridiculous on me. when buttoned, the top half was nicely fitted-- not snug; however, the lower half ballooned out to overemphasize the hips due to the pleating in back. the thing is, i have no hips, and having hips is a very good thing, though not i"
3467	This skirt is gorgeous. i'm glad i saw it in-store as the picture online does not do it justice. the colors are really rich and the pattern has a sentimental, vintage feeling. it also has pockets and a great, glamorous swing to it. this skirt is great for work with a blouse and heels and also looks awesome with a t-shirt tucked in and sandals. the fabric has a really nice four season weight, i think it will also look great with high boots and a turtleneck in the autumn. i get so many compliments
3468	Received this shirt yesterday and loved it. doesn't look that great online in pics, but it is a unique and beautiful top. the material is a substantial woven cotton so it lays nicely and keeps its shape . i am 5'5 and 128lbs and a small bust size 34a , i usually wear small in shirts but since it is a longer length i didn't want it to tight around my butt.... i am curvy in that area size 6 pants....i ordered the medium and i am so glad i did .. it lifts just like on the model...the only downfall
3469	Love these! they are my new favorite weekend pant. they are comfortable, versatile, and cute. the fit and cut are great too. a must have for your wardrobe.
3470	This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all, the armhole is way too low! second, there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper, it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.
3471	I was so ready to love this dress but it runs extremely small - like you should maybe purchase a size 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear.
3472	I agree, this dress runs long, but since i love high heels, it falls just right for me. it does seem quite roomy for a medium, which is a pleasant surprise. the fabric, drape and quality are contemporary but i know i'll be wearing this beyond this year for sure.
3473	This shirt is very comfortable and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i bought the neutral print and everyone wants to get close to see what it is . i would buy another if it came in this type of pattern.
3474	Cute top. i always get compliments when i wear it. a little boxy in style
3475	"This is a lot shinier in person, and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size. there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side. due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band, it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy."
3476	I so badly wanted this dress to work for me. the material and color is so beautiful. this had a 'sack like' fit and the side pockets accentuated my hips giving me a broader look than i would like.
3477	"Quite possibly, one of the most flattering, beautiful, and effortlessly romantic dresses i have ever tried on. and, to top it off, it has a sweet surprise: the silk slip on the inside of the dress has the same print as the outside shell, and it is so lovely, that if you feel like wearing something short and sweet, you can wear the slip as its own dress.  runs true to size, to maybe just a little bit big--if you have a smaller bustline and narrow hips, you might be able to size down.  it's cr"
3478	I am in love with this sweater. i am 5'4 and wear a size 8 and bought a large. perfect length and fit. will wear with jeans or leggings. the quality was amazing and i can't wait to wear it!
3479	I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it.
3480	Agree with other reviewers that the dress doesn't look like the picture so retailerpligie should really change it out. however i'm keeping the dress since it does look cute on. definitely more yellow in it than you can see.
3481	"This dress has a nice soft fabric and pretty details in the stitching and there is a matching slip with adjustable straps that snaps onto the inside shoulders. i found the length in petite to be fine but the loose fit to be unflattering for me as a short person (5'1""). however, the photos here on the website with the model are quite accurate- you can see exactly how it fits loose through the waist. if that's what you are looking for, go for it, but personally i didn't find it to ""do anything"" fo"
3482	This top is a lovely combination of rugged and refined and will be versatile wear for a party pared with nice pants and flats to casual with jeans and boots. it appears well made though i had to size up for my broad shoulders but other hh tops fit the same way.
3483	Caught my eye because of the colorful graphic print, in my closet because of the super sale price.  it fits as expected in size medium, a little bit long since i'm short.  i'm unsure of the longevity since it's a viscose mix.  feels a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i don't really wear tank tops without layers so this is a great addition to my casual wardrobe.
3484	I tried this on (in the store) on a whim....then had to have it!! i'm normally a small but really loved the way the medium fit. good thing because it was the last jacket like it in the store!! super soft, comfy...a great purchase!! fur is removable for easy washing or a different look!!!
